the life that you know I'm going to be like\nI Am an\nRemember that grow you can go with an account in the other day in our fourteen [noise]\nWasn't even full on sex it was just awkward touching and experimenting\nBut if she got back home\nOlder parents about it they were very upset with her for her decision she was embarrassed and so she said you did it against her will\nYou know that's not true that you can't prove it\nAnd remember we always believe the accuser because she's a victim your Savage male and that's what's Savage males do they walk around looking to rape\nWho was it was it can view polio Gloria Steinem ... one of the feminist\nVoices a few years ago declared that all heterosexual sex\nIs rate that it is naturally inherently right that women don't want it\nIt's a pretty profound statement if you think about the implications\nBecause it means that every form of sex is just some degree of rate they may have varying degrees of violence involved varying degrees of pushback that to suggest that a woman cannot does not ever consent\nMeans that you're throwing these behaviors in to a criminal context\nAnd because we take rape so seriously we've made the punishments very harsh\nLast time I went on Bill O'Reilly show I had received a call earlier that day and I was helping O'Reilly book gas from Texas and his producer call hey Michael I Need I guess I'm yells uh\nY'all are looking at a creating an automatic twenty five year sentence for anyone accused for anyone convicted of a sex crime\nIt was a deal where you took it out of the hands of the court to get out of the hands of the jury sentencing would already be pre determined by statute it'd be twenty five years minimal\nSet I Need somebody I Need a Democrat who's against is in a rally was going to pound the table and talk about how tough he was on sex crimes that is what he was afraid to do I so I find you somebody has to be you need to understand that statute is poorly written written and I'm\nConservative should not be for this libertarians certainly should not civil libertarians absolutely should not\nIt's a poorly written it's basically a campaign statute is what it is it's designed to make someone look tough on sex crimes and he said you're against the law which suggests a terrible law\nWas this was not written by a lawyer was written by businessmen who was\nLooking to run for another statewide office it's a terrible terrible law\nOr it will not hold up it will not hold up under appeal and it should it's badly written sort of like some of our drug laws sent people to prison for life for possession of a amounts of marijuana that assumed they were dealing when in fact they were just big users\nAnd he said would you come on air with Bill and do absolutely so I did and he started he interrupted me and he started into pounding the table and somehow I was defending sexual criminals because that was the whole point is you just need somebody to yell at that's what O'Reilly did\nAnd it really told me a lot about our discussion of things like this\nAnd this case said that this story had happened about a week after a case in Vermont\nWhere a guy had raped about ten eleven twelve year old girl\nAnd he'd been sending he'd been given probation so everyone was angry so I had a lot of conversations about this after I went on a rally showing people would say well how do you account for what happened in Vermont where a jury gave the guy probation for raping a twelve year old\nI said juries are comprised of peers Vermont ers are more liberal they don't view sex crimes in the way we would in Texas in Texas that guy would have been given a stiff penalty just how how different we are in our sentencing\nAre representation and our criminal justice system should reflect our values and the values in California Oregon or Vermont or simply different than they are in Texas Alabama or Louisiana and that's okay that's the way the system is supposed to work\nSo we said\nSo people would email me as a kid believe you you're you're you know you love pedophiles you and I said you know it's so easy for you to make such a stupid statement like that\nBut and I would write to people you know your son is going to be Seventeen going to have a fourteen year old daughter a fourteen year old girlfriend and she's going to be a week away from\nHer fiftieth birthday they're going to have consensual sex and later he's going to be arrested for statutory rape and he's going to be tagged in the same way that a fifty year old man that but ... and four year old boy is

it's easier than grappling with the difficulties of the human foibles inherent in a system administered by humans\nBut if you think you can put every situation you can you can shoe horned that into a

just it's just an act says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of vague inventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the re privilege\nClassroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to ... I think we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being comforted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make a terrible scary idea properly evil and that's\nThe worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of the a feminist

reach ... over him interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that\nMean to

of the house\nI mean look at the X. dream policies that the left is looking to push in through the Democratic party free health care\nSingle payer sorry single payer health care free health care free college I'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for in the even bigger a infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten\nOr ... democratic candidates which by the way it will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's going to be a lot more than I think uh but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and it does endorse Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it already there are many of them were cosponsors of the bill uh it\nSeems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single\nPayer and now here they are ... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care\nI think credible yeah we were scare mongers in races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but I ... I\nWent to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college you know that is a fundamental um a a a a fundamental aspect\nOf what brought the states together in the first\nPlace the state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything well then ... what do we have\nIt can't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter it will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat's pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected\nRight I'm only have to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this is an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college and into Trump's sports at for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind\nBut uh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe this is the right way to go which I mean you can get you just basically a country run by city I mean as you know it'd be which the Mets won that like as a Republican or certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\n... cities should run themselves in the city is getting run whatever they want and the rural or your skin do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand it taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them that I also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous\nRight and it's ... the house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the truth out right\nAnd you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could a race the mistake of the\nUh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate the way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things could be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next the the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way\nSo you go through another body that was much slower but it wasn't just that it was slower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state\nLegislature now what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics correct I shouldn't chair what's ah what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was Senator Barack Obama was center I shouldn't care about\nThat because they wouldn't be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto saying if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas like no that's the U.S is this the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\n\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you just arguing for king right with these several hours in a row the mic give you the argument for it came right\nI mean okay [laughter] really they've failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and slid lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed [laughter] uh no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for\nAnd I would also argue the failure park right you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland but Portland but\nOn the outside I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ...

it was a union job would be you'd be in the bottom of the river [laughter] [noise] what ... what\nWhat laws do you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young women they break his window and chase them down\nPolice nothing\nNothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did

Portland now or the law browns shirt stuff started beating\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever\nThat's pretty scary and the mayor ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I don't I mean I guess the\nThe just the idea of look
