{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "Class from east Texas long [noise]\nA thousand miles west to\nOkay [noise]\n'cause sometimes you get more talking about Obamacare [noise]\nWhat you're going to do about that [noise]\nThe fact that you favor raising taxes and Ted Cruz doesn't [noise]\nSo let's talk about [noise] a squirrel\nHow 'bout that that's what you're left\nEven CNN came out today and said that ... ... a lot about his mother he loves to tell on the stump that his mother is a life\nLong Republican but even she is supporting him to see bay does built in a lab they go in and go ... look\n... Chuck Schumer needs another Democrat urine Nancy Pelosi leftist Democrat when you're speaking the Democrat groups you tell them how liberal you are open borders sanctuary cities illegal aliens you were a gun grabber till the gun grabbing liberals that just don't do it in public\nUh your tax razor your tax and spend her you're a liberal now every issue\nAmounts to a the right groups that you think the feeling for the national\nAnthem is quote the most American thing you can do just don't say that down at the VW ... VW the VFW hall don't say that don't the VFW off your speaking before the American legion don't tell them that cake is better or something like that\nDon't say that to the cops course looks like almost all the cops have endorsed Ted Cruz so we'd product when he cups anyway\nSo why don't you just call the cops the new Jim Crow which he did I guess that was designed when black votes\nThey're black cops to their black people that are protected by cops and their families there are blacks were family members of victims of blacks who shot at cost her fault cops\nBut I guess if you weren't going to win the cops anyway 'cause you don't like law enforcement 'cause they've arrested you on two different occasions one for trying to flee the scene of a drunk driving accident\nAnd another for attempted burglary I guess if you really don't like the cops anyway comes naturally to you to insult them\nI wouldn't call that courage and I wouldn't call that Texan\nBut the beauty is starting on Monday in Texas we have\nThe first day of early voting and I'm going to ask you today when you get home to take a moment look it up and see where your early voting locations are here me out on this here me out just as important\nWhenever you go in to vote\nEarly voting is typically in the county that you live in not where you work the county where you live now there will be some distinctions the parishes of Louisiana for instance there will be some quirks in each state look it up it's probably very easy\nSpend just a few moments on the inner webs look it up bigger it out\nAnd then for a lot of folks early voting will start next week look up when early voting starts and where you can early vote devote five minutes to it's not going to be that hard don't rely on the guy down the hall\nLook it up on your own your secretary of state's office or your voter registrar which is usually a secretary of state will have a very easy how to\nGo and vote for the first day please vote straight Republican\nAll the way down the ticket in a lot of places you can just choose Republican right out of the gate and you don't have to ... you just choose every Republican who's on the ballot\nAnd that's it that's it and you're done you don't have to go down you're going to be tempted to go man these judges down he's state reps I don't know these people\nWell those are the people who have supported the party platform that you've supported and don't support the party of Hillary Clinton Nancy Pelosi if nothing else that puts them a leg up on the Democrats voted early\nAbsolutely positively vote early on the first day you you can don't wait till election day\nAnd you're going to hear that election day is November six please do not wait until November ... we're going to have a window that's going to open it's gonna be different in each of the states that you live in\nAnd I think probably most folks are going to start next week there'll be a few days sometimes up to two weeks where you can vote early\nGo in and vote and be done and no you did you report the other thing when you get to the voting location I tell you what the rules are in Texas I Can't speak to the other states\nBring your passport bring your voter id registration card if you have it bring your driver's license but if you can't find what you think they need\nGrabbed the forms of the ... and you know you have and go in there and insist that you cast a vote\nThere are a lot of volunteers and folks that are temporary workers that may say no you can't vote with the asked for an election judge your vote is important\nOver and over again fifty times in the last three weeks oh I'm Sorry I'm estimating well it'd be sixty can be twenty\nOh you don't keep track of every single time something like that happens I mean why would not I mean that is why I subscribe to a suitcase deliveries [laughter] dropped off you know a few dozen a day because you know you never know hearts in a suitcase and then deliver it to a private plane that solves\nMaybe on the bad guy here okay maybe on the bad guy I happen to run around a lot with my bones thought hey\nMake sure bad guy I don't think I I don't think it does your wife occasionally wrong on that one or two individuals your mom probably suggest stew don't be running around the house or the bones saw you know she did but I'm going to someone's eye out she also said donate sugary cereal and I do that now do\nYou know we we go up we get responsibility for our lives and you start making decisions as an adult in my decision is I'm going to carry my bones all around and again\nAnd occasionally my ... is is isn't so solar system right right exactly yeah at least I'm I'm going through the right steps of the cutting of it a little pieces and put them in individual cases and I think that's your clean up after yourself that's all you can do is clean up the mess afterwards\nAnd it's interesting too that the media is making a big deal out of every single time they talk about this guy they talk about him as if he's an American because they always say Washington Post reporter I ... I think he just he contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff\nMember of the Washington Post columnist was any or he's written it's relatively new yeah because he left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness was going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new\nAnd you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean an important that we are able to air those things\nAre but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven was the one he's made like he's tried to capitalize on with that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one the biggest a political documentary of all time\nBut in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like they've got to go all out there and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and it was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven\nUm right so this is not a new accusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with them for very long time and it's something that we've been critical about for a bit of\nOur allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but ... bomber was plenty friendly with them\nTo exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there was no way that Brock Obama would've done\nAnything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point no longer and it wouldn't have done anything about this a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of media coverage today the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker who is expensive right I mean remember good I'm bringing in Fahrenheit nine eleven again the big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat\nThere and you let the kids finished a book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the room remember this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big\nDeal at the time you know like but they saw Bush as this bad guy who ... who was who's incompetent Brock Obama waited what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything\nIt was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years\nThere's a sense of what are the way it was a decision you made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision in in the minds of people who want to praise the decision\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risk in the mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean it you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite of what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second\nLet's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally if for Rocco bomber was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't\nCare it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThe the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who was a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's brought about by or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on this board and and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nOr potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your own self but something happened there and ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't there are more of a story here maybe that's the story you run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIs it the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still well that'd be age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nAre actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ...\nUm Saudi Arabia publicly pledged payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] that our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that is kind of I mean look at it if not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision as the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the\nDay of American interests are harmed long term I'm by a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority for top priority is not a ... murders in Turkey\nRight like ... you know I don't know if anybody knows this but we're ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the pre anymore so studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things\nAll over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a column this is a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it\nAnd they're prioritizing over you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nRight like if this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up working for an American newspaper\nSo it's a big story and the and the details rounded are so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why it captures the interest but being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative and there's a lot at stake here\nShouldn't be a letter [laughter] and he just said no no no no it's a new it's a you know the guy went from like mid range pick in kick ball to last pick I\nMean like ... when this happened ... the guy is dead\nAnd you know ... you know no one ever said you know Osama's wrong it's it should be Usama Osama why no no it just started and if people just started using it\nVery strange it's it is very strange uh\nAnd like some of it I I guess they understand like for example a here we say the tiny little country that James Bond goes to the casinos Monaco\nRight mhm and if you're over there they call it ... ... everyone calls it Morocco I've never heard that I must say here's another one here we say Mazda for the car\n... if you listen uh as as a as a Canadian sports celebrity I Do quite often to Toronto blue jays games on the radio\nThey seem as though\nIt's mad stuff Toronto that's ... really irritating I wouldn't get us into that I Would say I mean would you be pissed off of you after you don't call it the ... stuff that is that what we are I've also noticed the jaguars are being called jak you are you are on the commercial on the\nJaguar what it's like they like if you come up\nWith a name on your own maybe you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced but what does the word we already know and when I say you were a hundred years yeah it's a topic we it's an animal yes\nAnd they're not just a car it's an animal to write what he ever says jak you are [laughter] the Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that's yeah I think that's jag you are trying to seem refined\nRight like it was like there's something a little snooty about the way they pronounce ... er jaguars ads that that that stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog had lifted jak you on her [laughter]\nWould you be gone [laughter] or they're ripping up by a bitter and into my dog had terrible I'd but luckily I felt with my bones on top of it though everything's going to be okay

great chance of winning the ... you know yeah he's very modest [laughter] so we'll see how that turns that will give you the updates when we get them or we need to warn you about something that's incredibly dangerous and our society and all too prevalent in that's a Disney Princess is um we're being watched\nBurned by a some Hollywood actresses that there is some danger there Karen nightly is promoting a her upcoming movie which was produced by Disney by the way the nutcracker the four realms\nBut she told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she's not a fan of every movie the studios produce because Disney Princess is don't uphold her feminist values ... so she is forbidden her three year old daughter eighty from watching certain movies like Cinderella which is\nA been banned in her household because she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her\nAnd she says don't rescue yourself obviously and this is the one I'm\n... mad because Cinderella waits to be rescued and there's not really as a self\nYes she did in ... to that situation she's also quite annoyed by the Little Mermaid she's banned that as well she says the songs are great but they don't give but don't give your voice up for a man or a man\nI think you know there's a lot of women are doing that today the main message modeled on a ... of really ... entire movie is to give up all of your rights to men and wait for them to rescue a especially a rash of rich guy\nThat's the message you should be taking from those movies I'm Christian bell is also fearful that Disney princes are sending the wrong message to her children she's actually the voice of the Disney Princess uh Anna and frozen wasn't that done by Christian Bale yes [laughter]\nSo she tells her daughter's Lincoln and delta that ah when she ... when she reads Snow White del taco bell yes and Lincoln bell yes and when she read Snow White two inch closes up the book and she says every time we close no white I look at my girls and ask\nDon't you think it's weird that Snow White didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple or where she got that apple\nI say I would never take food from a stranger would you and my kids are like no and I'm like okay I'm doing something right yeah you've proved it\nA while you nailed that one that you did this and\nThen she'll also say and girls don't you think it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission\nWell no because she's in a coma mom [laughter] can't give her permission and she'll say in a coma if he doesn't\nCancer right I mean she's advocating for the government could continue right the kids what gangs are out of it\nRight and bell says uh because you can't catch someone if they're sleeping\nOn though [laughter] I mean in my circumstances that's true however this is a notable circumstance which is why it's a movie in a book right the reason why you know about it is because it's different than everyday life right ... you know there there's a magical apple there's a a prince\nOr with a magical spell brown the princess yes and she's sleeping because she can't wake up right unless the prince kisses her that's\nKind of the premise that yeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that pretty your lessons don't apply to [laughter] so silly so weird I even get yourself so worked\nUp about that I you know what I Hope happens every day is every day when she brings breakfast to them they ask are or where the\nMoney [laughter] they just torture her with the rest of her life [laughter] 'cause I can understand this you know sometimes\nI I think even you know like the conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things are like when you watch uh you know that there's a there's one cartoon the kids were watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it was like I Know it was a captain planet or what ever do that that is an actual that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about environmental is a ... yeah they you know people who created it actually talked about that but I don't know what this one would not have been a pig or something\nYou're never you're never going to be able to solve this problem you believe is so prevalent ... by a story you tell them after ... reading Cinderella\nOr watching it for the Little Mermaid um or any of these uh Disney movies because they're already going to be a messed up from Simba falling down and blowing the word sex drive to the year from the dust ah that's going to mess them up\nA lot of teen

Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice from office there are just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no ... and no evidence\nYeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election\nThat Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time you see ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't you're occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know the those debates still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest eight Brett Kavanaugh\nBut I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations it was always about the ... the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court can they thought they had a chance of winning the Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court\nWould that was one hundred percent of of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and certainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was definitely part of her calculus there [noise] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story\nWe don't know um but\nThe other people and Cory Booker do not care won't for one second about what happened to this one not it's not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so you could call themselves Spartacus or and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um and yeah and it's and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nAnd again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but if you're judging by the standards that they're putting up\nIt's totally different look let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating after\nI think of how recent is Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... that story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says\nI Know these people are they were there none of those people say that if they remember this this incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she wouldn't be back what happened what mine of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say one of the witnesses she named\nInstead came out and said yeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on for something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witness thing the incident which just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party occurred none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this uh Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to go down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was saying like perjury charges or something against or\nFive people say ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred wow so not while for one person who is at the hotel or at the party in the capital case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after it occurred\nUh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn pantyhose in their shared hotel room Broderick explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband that her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days with the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape and that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe ... and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked a rapist like by the way I'm going to renovate the president over there so work\nUm NBC News found a date and which endorsed nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended newspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred\nThere was a prison outside the hotel window wow that is\n... times the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet that was ignored for ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats and now yeah you'll see occasion\nSaying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total ... to moment that only happens now after\nThey never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever get to them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump and that's why they have no more used for them but I mean bill\nClinton goes along it still makes a big levels speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there it's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so\nBizarre\nAnd the fact that they that that the media actually thinks we should\nTake their current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when you report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system\nWith actual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened I mean that is that the system we have it's\nThe best in the world and the idea that we are now supposed to go through these kinds of records and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it\nIs now or standard that can sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is substantial evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated a reception\nOf Michael ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy the I guess they are so pissed off about that and they do not want him running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are today are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then all of it out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad that even Trevor Noah who's the ... I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million to power but I'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other night took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit\nActually said some some accurate things are about her and and whether or not she's the best person to be speaking out on sexual allegations here's what he said\nThose who enabled the book will stun you as Nazi hunters risk their lives to track down mass killers like Adolf Eichmann were protected by ruthless forces there is a reason why the killing books are sold more than twelve million copies\nSo I Hope you check out killing the ss it's well worth your time\nIn our peak envoys list\nPrice dealer price to be happier if your car shop and you've probably heard these terms of\nWhat they mean it's so confusing well it was confusing not any more until you about true price from ... it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because true car shows you what other people are paying for [noise]\nWith guns do for Glenn today and tomorrow it's going to south in Pennsylvania have ... you're on the Glenn Beck program\nHey guys how you doing good uh I'm laughing when you were talking about kind of the her reading those stories and how we kind of make fun of the reaction mhm well believe it or not that kind of stuck really impact here I'm a I'm forty two\nToday's my birthday and birthday and Oh thank you and I laugh because when I was about seven there was an episode of the ...\nAnd ... it it's French socialists cartoon and I'll never forget it because the opposite of what the village\nAnd ... declared himself like pain of the murders and the other marked rebelled and there was a war among the smart because no one should dictate\nThat singular message when I was a kid stuck with me my whole life and I know when I became a libertarian it's why I went to law school and I I I argued the way I did it why when I teach I'm always like the ...

[noise]\nYou're listening to Glenn Beck helping out with that and do triple eight Seventy Seventy easy Kay [noise] uh there's this\nThere's an interesting thing for the New York times today and it is they do this little pod cast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage ever ever\nUm well you did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah and that and they said yes that are part of the saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him doing something\nThat against them as well right like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where um he\n[noise] again like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure in himself while on the phone with her because I guess he was breathing heavy or something\nAnd ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics our dynamic absolutely yeah power makes you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian he using ... he wields incredible power right in this country now incredibly led to ever\nFired at any job in the nation any job you're a sarcasm is just reality in a situation like I said well why is that what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them\nPeople were other comedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there is something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was\nWas this is ... ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it he didn't\nForce her to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation last alert to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously icky right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I've I've issues I'm Sorry\nSay that is is that sexual assault and the accusation there I Know that was shown which she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so I ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right and then he admitted in such a general way that people kind of\nUh making people he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make that make them right and I think\nThat the what I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing however is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible but that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence\nOf that he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again just making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was the folks who scares away from right you're not supposed to just as the other people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar as famous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedian you never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks in it doesn't fit\nOr Jerry Seinfeld comes in a while because that are loose okay well I'm In a doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went as he's tried to do this he's bounced around just several clubs around New York since and they let him on stage so the New York times or the exhaustive report about tried to talk to the club owner about why you let him on stage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision was some\nOther people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy said he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work that he's like\nNever ... might never say never\nI said well can you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence and never work again he says I don't care and never missed a admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the owner of a place where you would say particularly to a female customer who was somebody else on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton\nAnd you have to look at these things as they said I mean is even sorry he's not doing shows again um and he was a ... he was accused of something um you know what's his face from the New York times he's back\nA uh Glen or what the heck is his name get wrong thrush right he used a of a of harassing a young interns and other underlings and he he's back at work\nWe have this weird so why I mean Mike Tyson is pretty clear the man was convicted of rape not not a certain time convicted of rape spent time in prison yeah and he's like the darling of the media he comes out of you guys it's silly appearances every we have a problem going anywhere now doing anything and he used to I mean and look he served time and he's out right yeah\nUm and so you could make the case as the left has beat forever that people who go in and felons should be able to come back and vote you should be their programs to give felons in convicted felons and murderers jobs\nYet but when someone's accused of something much less than murder they can never work again and not even convicted just accused ... yeah it really doesn't make any sense dribbling seven twenty seven back is the phone number or it is a pat and sue for Glenn who uh is reverse thing currently\nUh the Mediterranean Sea\nIn a canoe or he's always wanted to do it and he finally said you know what this is a week or so but he's doing it alone alone which is\nAmazing just amazing I I don't know if there's a Web I heard that there would be some uh there'd be a boat going next to him with a webcam so you could see all the action but\nUh no I think he had passed away came to the canoe and and it's just it's just just him canoeing across the Mediterranean Sea\nWow it must be a water for it must be like a go pro because it would have to be waterproof but yes it's a long long journey we think he's back Monday but we're not

like well I think he ... he people did blackout how the hell do you know not\nOnly he would know that right or maybe he did I I don't see how that's all that uh there's no way to know that and to their conversation but still there's no way to know what it's a ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this\nIs the\nSubtle accusation that everyone who supported Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person\nEven from people like you know there are people in the left that you know I'm sure as I said I certainly know them\nAnd they were against Kavanaugh because they believe ah you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially in everything that they're saying which is they accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want him on the Supreme Court right and like no right now is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want him on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... ... you have not provided any evidence to bring it with that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her is your prerogative but you don't accuse me of of the ... of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I I think I don't think it happened\nI don't either if it hadn't been I think it happened with somebody else\nMaybe but even that is is this is a I don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't there\nBut the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing\nThat happens with any big public official a in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades then talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who were there and they can't remember the party\nLike water we and the person who's making the accusation\nHas an overt uh dislike for the\nParty of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist is march that women's march rallies is is an obvious Democrat like\nYou have to take in ... motivation forty years later into account I always started skepticism I had this idea basically I think people almost like it's going to sound bizarre but\nI think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Know I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors no no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor the indicate that vis a vis a vis a Kurd\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would I ever called the victim I called them survivor but then I wouldn't they Levi on\nEvery survived this assault by this man yeah but if they've assault didn't happen they didn't survive it and [laughter] yeah [laughter] I guess we could all call ourselves survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us so far life\nYeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make\nIt up why would she lie about it\nThat's a good question because I Love this one mhm possibly come on your motivation [laughter]\nNot that accurate should like this I don't know when I taught at school we talk about\nUh yeah I Know we talk about\nThe the women's right to choose it is just ended and if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one\nI wouldn't defend my children's lives about as strongly as they ... they defend their right to kill their children hit is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn\nThat right that you think is so vital is insane we seemed far crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week were five five accusers accused of high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted\nLike him didn't like him yeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle on receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay\nThis happens all the time you know why\nPeople are are of all many of them are awful their women are awful men are awful that he was terrible things that you can explain it happens all the time and the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing a swastika on their door for nothing you know to like say well I was a victim of of\nOf anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot one of the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they can do we know for\nA fact the fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them we know the ... the fourth accuser didn't even bother right any information on\nTheir letter including their name or where they lived or when it happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ... and no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over the store\nAnd the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first two\nAnd in the second one is it is there's a ... they're right when they the person who made the allegation\nSaid I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them All right well I guess\nYou could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that person said no it didn't happen\nAnd she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember it even happened exactly\n... operating what evidence on that one either and they're ... and look the Fort one was only ... I think taken more seriously than the others because there was an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people there was no evidence proving that had happened here I'm In and of course obviously people a cabin on his uh his or what this is worth saying no um but\nThat one was serious because she went in to you know took the step of going in front of the of the of the hearing and and and doing it\nRelatively credible job at recounting what she believed the story was who knows if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the United states who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation against someone but it's just completely false\nIt's just an eight yeah of course you can do it I mean that as we heard with Hillary Clinton she said they were they vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this like in the media access if it's an\nEntirely foreign world where someone could live on politics [laughter] I Know of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably and all of them\nAnd you brought up the high school situation in California where they call it the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nUh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault or and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk\nI don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him they didn't like him to really encourage\nOr how about the Ohio University student who ah got threatening notes about how they didn't want her in her elegy peachy lifestyle to them to be in the students' Senate anymore at Ohio University\nUh she was a angry and frustrated and disappointed she said I'm a ... you may find my me revolting and worthy of a threat of my life but in reality it's your beliefs that a repulsive you need to get this through your head you eh thing a whole I Am proud to be who I Am and nothing could say or do or ever change that\nBy the way the ... of course admitted to sending the threats to herself\nA or the woman and why would you do that yeah why won't curb motivation possibly be it's hard to do in this case it's not hard to detect with Brett Kavanaugh\nOr a the a woman in Texas who said a state trooper sexually assaulted her until of course the camera footage came out and her own attorney had to say we're sorry for bringing in this case we didn't know about this at the time\nOr the charges against the for dentist accused in Las Vegas of raping a ... a people and that was also found to be completely false\nAnd untrue or ah how about the racist receipt and we don't tip of terrorists to an Arab a person at a restaurant\nUm who again later I had to admit that yes he actually wrote the stuff on the receipt wow or the former college student who claimed rape and then it had to admit in court that it was completely false on Long Island\nOr a Kansas men who said he put racist graffiti on his own car or or or the races note at Saint Olaf college if you remember this one\nUh that was one where they talked about uh once again the this terrible race racial note do everyone apparently the racism is rampant all across the F pure white complacency all over the place where we find out later of course not true we can go on and on and on and on with these stories\nLet's see if we can get you out of paying to\nGo to relieve factor dot com\n\nGlenn Matt [noise]\nSuper blend on the Glenn Beck

attempted genocide because he posted the photo of a toy gun\nAnd you know with a toy gun who knows how many people I mean he could have put an eye out\nI have a good idea of how many people are zero [laughter]\nProbably yes zero\nIs right and it's harder they actually they actually arrested him for disturbing the peace\nThe photo of of all the air soft it was an air soft gun I'm was disturbing the peace I mean that's amazing isn't it also I mean that cannot hold up\nI can not hold up\nI wouldn't think so but the the community as applauding the police swift success the Swiss successive locating arresting him\nIs due to the timely information provided by numerous concern teens and adults as well as the cooperation of the park ridge police department and the cook county sheriff's bleak so is this was a was a a multi department\nGood uh operation and she'd get this kid weight does this story come around though do we here at the end but by the way they found out it was an air stuff done and now he's now I\nKnow this story you know ...\nCause I mean if let's just say you had a realistic looking air stuffed gun ... that may be a lost it's a little are you I assume they all have the orange thing on the end shifts are fake right let's just say that fell off or something or a blackberry what'd you say\nHe's walking down the street or he's walking towards the school I can

piece of people are gonna freak out and then you release them right let's say a max the maximum penalty but we will look we're going to take the gun will return it to you later\nInstead they found the ... gun in his truck and arrested him for disturbing the peace they realized it was an air south yeah they knew what was in ... they said it was a nurse often\nAnd they're they're still being
