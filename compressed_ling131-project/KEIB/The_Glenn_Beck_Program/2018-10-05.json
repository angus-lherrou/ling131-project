Shandling was is that right now I mean you could do or the United states for the rest of your life and now they're so which\nHBO Netflix Hulu YouTube to see every there's so much you don't need to be broad mhm you'd be I was at a in Cleveland the there's the theater right across the county club and it was sold out there's lying around the block and I go who who's performing you would think like the Beatles you don't want to like\nSome kid I never heard of yeah no it's it's I guess that's amazing yeah I ... I was amazed me where you don't have to just go see\nIt in comedy is very subjective so you could love someone it'd be like Glenn check this guy out and you could be like not for me yeah right yeah because comedy is very ... subject you can't tell them if you can tell him it's not funny right what this guy's funny to me yeah so that's a that's what I've what I've experienced the harvest\nSo uh you know one of the things that when I when I uh was\nI feel like do they tell you the you looked like somebody\nDoes it do you want to do the you know how that you know how bad it is somewhere colonel Sanders is like I look like Glenn Beck I don't know [laughter]\nThat was going to go into a different direction I don't know if\nYou heard this before he looked like Dave Ramsey with hair [laughter]\nDavid actually really good like mad [laughter]\nAll right this is making me a little uncomfortable but hey it's a it's a new world set or the U.S [laughter] I was a ... now this isn't helping because I'm Sorry I'm going into what's going on what I propose to my wife yeah she said no and a and a new Dell\nJohn ... what year was a isn't the nineties okay yeah okay [laughter] that rational respond to write the nineties alright yeah I'm just trying to get an eye out here you have those\nSo she said no and she said the reason why is because we don't have God in common and I said I'm you know I I Believe in God ... everything and she said you don't go to church and I said\nI see you every Sunday after church ... every time you come home talking about the people who are honking at each other or yelling yeah they're running the park oh why oh yeah yeah I Know it yeah it's crazy yeah it's crazy how people are in church and they're finding that but they're like they're looking at their watch the news and then um\nYeah yeah yeah they won out which of these ... these video ... road rage and the church parking lot because I make all these ...\nI make two videos a week and some of them connect and some of 'em don't just probably like your content of your books yet sometimes with people like\nYes thank you we needed that sometimes you put your heart and soul into something like yeah like well was that one that connected or know that when the connected ... yeah 'cause I don't think you'd have to be a Christian\nToo or good church going person to you've heard about that mhm from your wife and baby like yeah I Know how it goes and they're just like yeah and it's just the\nThe what's funny is the juxtaposition of a ... you know God first serve others I mean\nHow do you live in ... steps away\nThe human spirit wouldn't you say like if you like you see someone on T. V. and they're given a run down and you just go\nThat's not right it doesn't seem right that guy's lion mhm you just know because everyone is a human ... like you can spot in sincerity and why everybody loves that is because everyone when people get mad at my jokes at the live show because you're going to come and the whole crew is going to come to night\nSo to get sick and we kind of you know they have yet to bring up on the ... people people are like stabbing each other they have a ticket that's what I that's what our goal you're right I mean it's a good clean comedy show you won a few good yes at the ticket to people the people\nAre like ... whenever I tell a joke it's like a cross the line I go oh stop I I Know you've got a text each other this personally you're young and I I Know like right when the radio when the lights go off you know like if there's an interview there like come on it will be real this guy\nLike because that's how you generally said on the late ... yeah that's what humans [noise]\nAnd I feel like I've connected with you 'cause you're like to sew somebody's like tell somebody was telling us the truth out here yeah you know what I'm saying and that's what people I think comedy is comedy hard in two thousand Eighteen I go I think it's way easier because you don't to to cross the line you don't have to say anything\nRight mhm it used to be in the nineties you had to say the most profane mhm disgusting I never even I Can't believe this is coming out of someone's mouth but it into does anything we heard everything we've seen everything ... so it's kind of coming back to like a Jimmy Fallon type\nI I I said years ago that I thought the only thing left shocking\nWas what up in individual actually felt yeah that's the only thing left shocking you know what you really are feeling and want to say but you don't\nAs I I Can't believe you said that yeah oh yeah well I have a joke in my act about uh like everyone like we're all good Christians in here we're driving down the road and seen that cyclists on the side of the road I Wonder if I just like [laughter]\nLike why is that why does why why it really happened and vet\nThat joke has stayed in my show for about four years because it every button yeah you have what's at the bottom of that you're a ... you want to be the person in church that and then the real human yeah is the guy you all have a dark\nSide yeah ... is that got now might be something might be better or worse than others some ... some might be against the law and some direct sunlight\nActually that's the reason why\nThe the reason why the outrage in the culture and people were coming after cabin are because you were like\nIf if if we can notch him down\nI feel like that's why the tabloids exist that's why the outrage exist because you'd think these people are\nAbove view the people listening that are ... are like Glenn Beck is up here\nYou know the people listening now okay [laughter] you know they are they're like I'm Better than that [laughter] um ... when everybody started out an even\nPlaying field and then you get you know that's what you get rich or famous or a successful or the c._e._o. see you'll be down here and him be up here is not sit well with people so if we can somehow\nExpose them as a human and that's what I said in my act for a long to every scandal that ever comes out past their politics athlete that headline should be person acts like human\nMhm right\nYeah well not long for me it was ... well some of them [laughter] some of them aren't related I mean I oh yeah oh you

will teach the left you can do this to anybody ...\nHow do you ... 'cause my still would say I I go to my daughter's wedding but I don't know how I could reconcile that\nOh well it depends on\nDo they still wanted to vote without his they may not or if they're fifty fifty I say go to your daughter's wedding yeah if it's less let let's play the game though it is forty nine forty nine essentially you'd have to probably ...\nWell no it's well yeah I mean it but again let's say mansion switches right now he's a Democrat one Democrat voted for the Republican so\nLet's say ... signifies today or that he can go and and vote for the Republican but let's say he he changes that tomorrow so instead it forty nine forty now that it's not a sure thing you need ...\nI I got to say like my ... inch of hardware that your gun was psycho at my daughter but in ... and the end you you really think that I kind of had the other opposite thought which was my initial thought was this is really important\nI think if my actual daughter not like a you know now own daughter but like my daughter ... she's getting married screwed this country\nI Am they're like that's like the most important thing in my life I did sign up for that job but I did not sign up to a band in my family\nNo you didn't but your family can that can be moved for instance if the vote is it you know two o'clock\nA that is still what a Montana time noon or eleven o'clock you could say hey move that I'm going to vote at two o'clock eastern time that's eleven o'clock if the the ceremony was supposed to start at noon started at six started at three and I'll be there\nBut the ... vote right like move the vote\nYeah you know they're they're planning on doing by the way if they need ... they're going to delay the holy until he comes back oh jeez delayed the vote well only if they need him right now he doesn't look like they need him we should be clear about that um it looks like it would be fifty to forty nine an easy thing to do you could just ... it doesn't have to be tomorrow to no\nNo they can relate to Sunday yeah or easily yeah or Monday but there's a risk of like you know some new accusation without a crazy thing that happens you know knows what the Democrats will try right yeah a ... there is a risk there there is a risk there [noise] but I mean I Am I missing my daughter's wedding", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "05"}
