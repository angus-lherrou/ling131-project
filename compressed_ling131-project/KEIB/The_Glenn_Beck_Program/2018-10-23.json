get your the military is the only solution you can't let them in no way it's Seventy five hundred people\nLook at they they try to handle it on the southern Mexico border yeah the ... the ... just rushed into yeah\nSo if I could uh demise CNN impersonation briefly so what you're asking for them to just start shooting and killing all the people [laughter] that's what that's what there\nIs no

Seventy five hundred people want to the officers do\nDo they try to fight them off\nDoes the does the criminal justice system sending more troops and tried to fight those people from storming the gates and opening up our prisons well we wouldn't want that I mean some people could\nGet hurt what do you what are we talking about\nWell if they're Seventy five hundred people and they want to go into a small town and Rob every single restaurants truck stop bank because they're Seventy five hundred of them and there's not enough police in these small towns where we just going to let them take all of the money\nOr do we say no this is a mob\nThis is a a group of Seventy five hundred people who are stating they are going to break the law\nAnd they've already done it and they're just crossing in an overwhelming where did we would never let anybody do that to any other thing why would we allow them into our country\nWe wouldn't let them into our towns just to\nJust to take over our towns we would we would never allow this to happen can you imagine I mean you seem just the waste and the garbage left behind you know it's amazing they are just crashing everything along the way\nWhat are we supposed to put up with that too you just come into our town and just trash it and then we have to clean up the mess after you\nAnd the question not being asked enough is why are there are so many young men no no no there's a lot of those already for\nYour own or no no no no those are just women young women and children that are that forced\nTo look like in like ... year old men yeah yeah who should be defending their own country yeah who should be making their neighborhoods better who should be fighting for their own country have you noticed how\nHave you noticed how the media is just calling these guys migrants yeah and knocked Marxist protestors because that's what this is this is a Marxist protest\nTheir their Marxist government which was in bed with the Castros in Cuba and manure oh in Venezuela they were ousted in a coup because they were destroying the country they were ousted\nJust as ... has done in Venezuela correct same thing\nSo they were ousted what happened they get pissed off they start\nCoordinating with the door Owen Castro and the ousted president they have been disrupting their own country now they want\nPublicity they want this to be a world stage and so they started coming up towards America They're not looking for a job is they're not looking for a better life this started as three thousand people who wanted to make a Marxist point\nToo embarrassed their own country because they got rid of a Marxist dictator\nWe're just going to we're fine with that we're just fight with these people coming in really what will they do if they did get jobs and decide to live here what kind of what kind of philosophies are they bringing with them\nAll the media doesn't care about any of that and do the Democrats don't care about any of that of course not hear about because they they\nJust want them here as voters\nAlready they're sending out to all these registration forms in Texas the Democrats are in Texas set out but voter registration forms to illegals all over the state inviting them they've already filled out the the uh citizenship box pushed yet they check the S.\nAnd sent this out to non residents all over the uh all over the state\nThere's we have the governor is to increase their power base we have the governor of the state coming on and just a minute or we have Greg Abbott coming out at about ten minutes\nOr we're going to talk a little bit about the uh the massive rally for Ted Cruz and Donald Trump uh yesterday in Houston it was\nUnbelievable and the massive turnout but this is in Harris County which is Houston Dallas County which has Dallas those are blue areas and it's a massive turnout massive\nTurnout uh if the\nThe red parts of the state don't actually turned out this state could be in big trouble because it is a massive\nTurnout is there any thought or with the caravan of just learning from our friends to the south and what we do is we just let people come in and we just kinda guide them until they get all the way to Canada and they're walking north would they'd never that necessarily they're stopping here\nA candidate beautiful this kind of your time of year we didn't kinda it's kinda walk on the side of the streets and just kind of them\nAnd we would if it was going to Canada and they were protesting Canada I think that would be a lot of people just don't cause and you just let him go to Canada I'm sure a lot of people in Mexico are saying that just right just what loose not our problem they just want to go to America just not our problem well it is your problem\nAnd if ... if Canada would say to us you stop this or we're not going to trade with you we zero aid that like they give us any aid zero zero cheese whatever it is we're not giving you any of that\n... as a good neighbor we would stop it we need to be very clear no aid for Mexico none I Know the president said that about Honduras in Guatemala and I hope he backs it up cut that aid off right\nAnd Obama is out and he's in you know these these rooms that are like four hundred people maybe ... maybe tops two thousand\nAnd they're shooting it so it looks like a big crowd but it's not they did that in the midterms 'cause he's crowds went away here we are at the midterms and Donald Trump still has these gigantic crowds and and listen\nTo what can we played Sarah the audio that was played on the loudspeakers outside of the rally last night and Houston listen to this\nCan buy a house [laughter]\nIn the family finally turning point having\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\nI Know when you have Tom tom ...\nAround you and how often do you live in the ... the rally\n[noise] I Can't believe we have to have those announcements are but we we did um and the crowd was more than ...\nIf I was a Robert Francis a O'Brian or what's his name or ... or running against Ted Cruz I Would be a little concerned um because it was an overwhelming response from Texas where Texans\nI thought were a little um [noise]\nI don't know calm about this election and it didn't really realize how much money ... and others have\nPoured in to make this a blue wave here in Texas more than any other Senate candidate or for any quarter and history thirty eight million dollars for Beto just for him that's not all that and\nThat's not including the ... money that is going into this state outside a lack of money and tons of that um so uh we're going to talk to the Governor Greg Abbott we're going to talk to them a little bit about the care of and and also about what's happening\nUh here in our state he's also running for reelection but his he's so far ahead of any contender he is really the greatest\nGovernor I have ever\nI've ever lived under I mean I've never had a governor of a state that I've been more proud of\nA than a Greg Abbott um\nAnd obviously a lot of Texans feel the same way because it's a it's a run away campaign for him\nBut the state of the state and the election when we come back and Governor Greg Abbott mercury\nFox News I'm Chris foster being reported by our sister networks sky news that parts of\nThe Saudi journalist or mocha show these body have now been found in Turkey the Saudi Government claims his death was an accident during abroad the cartoonist embolden Turkish president reject type everyone says otherwise\nGentleman ... was laying in a vicious violent American that was\nPlanned for days he says including the use of a body double and giving talks with staff the day off CIA director Gina Haspel was in Turkey to review the case the mid term election is two weeks from today a lot of people will already voted by than\nThree dozen states like voters cast ballots early several open voting centers last month weeks before election day two years ago early voting trends suggested Democrats had the advantage in Florida North Carolina and Nevada Hillary Clinton won only Nevada Fox is Jared health but in Washington this is Fox News [noise]\nOn the Patriot am eleven fifty and they're going to do you tell me that he went ... cherry there's a crash that was clear from the right lane but you're still seeing delays from the ...\nDistrict we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save huge money life changing money if you switch to Medicare for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just doing the math of six thousand dollars a year that is significant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred to eight\n[noise]\nWe're thrilled to have a the a great governor from the great state of Texas Governor Greg Abbott on with us now hello governor how are you sir\nReally and I am doing terrific how's it going good\nIt's always good to talk to you I'm a I I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive\nTurnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell you and how's the turnout the rally around the rest of the state\nWell this may be frustrating but because of the true answer is it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this safe ... running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote for your listeners what we're saying with regard to the turnout is a smash them records are not just for mid term elections which is what this is a but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds\nThe amount of those that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is this and that is a massive number of people are turning out to vote will know that part\nBut do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan is coming up here and we want to make sure which like people who are going to do something to stop it uh but here's all I can tell your audience and that is if you care about the future of Texas it\nWould be clear about the future of America or you could not sit on the sidelines\nThis election we're because there are other people out there\nWho are casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your values must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this\nNeed to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a governor and a lot of times people have said this is the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I always hated that praise but in this particular case we are now\nSeeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say you know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing a ... a election is it not\nWell he he captured the as soon as very correctly because it used to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either rent under no label or they would call themselves a\nConservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and didn't they were progressive and now they're openly or lifting themselves as\nSocial with us and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor in Florida a isn't out now that he says he is a\nSocialist and and the Bernie Sanders style of socialism if not even further typical apt in the same thing is happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as\nThe open border policies that is socialism or with a look at the uh wealth distribution policy that is socialism and have all these people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where the reported inflation rate in Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's ... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and ah you know unbeknownst to most people is Soros has dumped\nMillions of dollars into the state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing and so many of your listeners need to understand that George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles are two years ago he gave a ... a million dollars or directly to a candidate\nIn Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that has funded these ground game stick it out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that but let's go back to the first part of your questions\nAnd listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really blew cities in blue counties you have a Dallas year after year to have San Antonio you have all that and you have El Paso\nAnd so you have these massive blue regions across the state of Texas that makes it\nSo much harder for people who are conservative people who are Republican to be able to\nBut today for example when we hang up I'm headed to\nA belt and they GO Campaign for some people they aren't going to be a in Dallas County later on today I'm going to be in ... county later on uh in in the week and then ... ... there's been a lot of climate north Texas and in South Texas east Texas of West Texas or to make sure that we win these elections\nFrom the top of the ballot to the bottom of the ballot\nGreg always go to the good stuff you think you'd go to appreciate it God Bless you God Bless the upstate\nGovernor Greg Abbott of Texas by the way from Texas a matters or do you\nTexas goes blue [noise]\nYou then have New York\nYou don't win an election again [noise]\nAh they have taken the electoral college uh every single time [noise]\nAxes must remain bread and for another reason

and a lot of times that never has\nA but we saw that in the presidential election too I mean we how many times the Pennsylvania seem like it was all to me that's going to happen and it never did until this last election where did turn over a I think the more interesting race those the ones for attorney general in Minnesota we know this one because Keith Ellison is running\nAnd normally I don't think we talk about a specific attorney general race it's not necessarily national interest is one with details that I think is Alison was up by five points in the last full however that Paul happened right before all the sort of accusations started flowing against\nPeace that will not true though is it him in the bathroom with the guy is that true [laughter]\nI don't know what allegation that is I don't there was a new allegations that I Want to repeat it I Believe you're thinking if Cory Booker there was an all of them in our area of yes yes yes I live on that one or not true is it I mean I don't as I think you should all these things you are innocent until proven yeah the the same and charges against Cory Booker one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every ... every one of which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man made that decision but\nWe don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them for 'em so you know that's the way I think you're supposed to have let's why innocent until proven guilty is a thing\nA and I think with not only a Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism by the time these relationships break up and there's things that and who knows there's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing what would\nThey were talking about what capital and everyone you know half the country believes Cavanaugh I should be you know I don't put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to keep up with so they don't care about it he can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations\n... what's fascinating is that people have Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happens latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points soda\nWow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC a very well known is on TV all the time\nAnd he's she's credible she's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy dated him for a very\nLong time there is video there's witnesses there's Dr reports\nAt the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who\nDoesn't want to hurt the Democratic party she'd rather have Allison on another Democrat when she doesn't write your phone into a ... it's just crazy yeah it's an amazing wants to that one forty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they felt they had Alison\nRunning for that post they thought they had that wrapped up a instead it's forty three thirty six so right now we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go uh there's a if you're looking at right now a forty a four seats are that are\nSafe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have to it's forty six excuse me forty six if you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you can get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes a Tennessee which is\nStill very close to poll came out yesterday that had\nThe Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head they're\nVibrant and then in Texas still leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer then you get a few ... a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got a another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can do three of six they're gonna be at fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they can if they can pull off sticks of six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things passed or so\nYou know at that level of whether it's a I mean they could lose it to the could easily still losing it's possible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six is is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that is a big difference uh so could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks\nAgo but it's still on the unlikely side [noise] election by numbers\nOn the program over twenty third there is there going back program\nAll right what I Would take a break and we'll tell you about our spots and then we come back and I'm going to tell you about\nI mean there's a real problem and you haven't even considered it to really know what you know that which is er out putting X's Donald Trump you know the witches or\nI did not know that you haven't been keeping track of all the ... the the which is that are putting X's on Donald Trump and\nAnd Ted Cruz and others now and what are they what are the Texas board of the ... actually intended to accomplish destroy them to destroy them yeah I have not seen this no oh okay well I've I've kind of brushed off myself I mean I'm up on it but I kind of brushed it off I like I which is\nNo there is something else that we now have from a credible source that I think every American especially women need to be aware of what's coming up in just a second\n\nIMF financial warnings and the escalation in the central bank gold buying in Hungary\nIs making the news ...\nHungary has in Greece states gold reserves by one thousand percent\nIn a due to increasing quote safety concerns this the first time since Nineteen eighty six that hungry central bank is buying gold bullion and it's a lot of it up thirty one point five tons\nOf gold ah they also have repatriated their gold from the bank of England to Budapest central banks in Europe are diversifying are moving in and repatriating to take possession of the gold in their own country\n... maybe talking about that for a while really ... who knows that are hungry\nIn Poland or the most recent central banks to do this but Austria the Netherlands and the Germans were the first to do it uh they had been repatriating their gold from the bank of England and the Federal Reserve in recent months and years\nJust bought it from Goldman within a lot easier right why us for it back when it doesn't really\nThe reason why repatriation of gold is dangerous is because of a word\nAnd write this down on a you know going to do that very high path occasion thing again are you I'm just saying that right yeah when you hear it your blood will run cold when you hear people actually talking about well the problem is ... that's\nWhen you had to the mountains [laughter] that's when you know so that's the only reason why I bring this word up when you read about it in a serious way that they are now starting to discuss re hypothesis Haitian\nThat's when you run for the hills okay right now we're at the beginning of that possible wonderful thing by um you know everybody claiming their gold and who's gold really is it all and all of the central banks buying more gold\nTold that if I ever see like a teapot idle rub it to have the genie come out which is strange because why he's trapped when there was an opening right there in the you know in the in the lantern there's an opening right\nThere right at and I I think I Would make that he lame point whiz with the cloth device first of all cloth does not seem difficult to penetrate but secondly there is an opening for the eyes I mean the the genie could just go ahead go right through there to get into the head\nOf the person right now they don't I mean just from a pragmatic now the perspective you just go right through there as long as you're wearing gloves\nA full body you know\nAre covering and then your head is wrapped and you're just have the eyes\nNow your ice can be used to a a lure a man or even just if the eyes if you look at him and just write\nYou can say you know it's not like you know look how they're dressed it's look how they were looking at me or on her and so you can uh you know you can be be which if you will by ... by a woman's eyes I think even in this in\nLightened me to era we can all come together and say if a woman looks at you you know what are you going to do right exactly I mean you\nKnow ... it's it's a specially if she's been possessed by a gym [laughter] I mean you know this is the\nThing we were talking about this off the air a little bit because you know Donald Trump used the word nationalist yesterday talking about nationalism and well in the definition of nationalism in history is is at times very disturbing lane um however ... you know I don't know I'm sure that's not obviously no one is citing\nThe really bad examples of nationalism as an as where we're trying to go if you're Donald Trump you're not saying we want to be like those terrible countries he seems to be referring to it as like look we're the best country and we were routed and we have a great the best you know culture and he went and we should be\nA you know patriotic and and and be ... up you know sure excited about that but when you talk like this that when you\nWhen you play a clip like that it's hard to kind of argue that we don't have a superior culture and a lot of ways\nYou know like I can say that because you've probably been possessed by a gym or ...\nThis is the gym tolerated and now it's a different kind of a threat was times I've had a lot of of ... they are in my life [laughter] I got to say it's travel yeah and then they can get you in to leave it in the bottle adds up ...\nSixty shots of beer on a program recently alive on the air right it'd be an issue but I think I'm OK saying that a culture that embraces women as equals he's superior to a culture that that puts them but won't let them drive and and forces them to address the specific way that you can't even see their face like that it that I mean\nThey might as well regime over there I'll share but those are all just social construct\nMaybe it's just a good social now sometimes things are built and they're good to know the good piece of ... no not not from the west not from the west which\nBrings me back to the caravan when we come back [noise]\nFox News some Chris foster the FBI's investigated and attempted male bombing at the liberal billionaire donor

[noise]\n\nSo let's talk about the caravan for a second [noise] ah because we really need to decide what we think about this and what we're going to do about it\nWhat do you think we should do about it and you need to have this conversation with all of your friends right now\nWhat do you call people Seventy five hundred who are political Marxist activists that's what they are political Marxist activist marching with the Honduran flag\nIn protest that their Marxist government was ousted in Honduras\nWhat what do you call them as they're marching towards our border they're not refugees\nThey chose to leave their country they're finding their country\nThey were trying to get a do a political stunt\nSo what what are these people where did they get the money who's doing the supply chain how how do you even have the bathroom services all along the way who's providing medical aid so it's not a death march you can\nMarch twenty five hundred miles and expect everybody to be okay and in good health when they arrive\nThings happen\nWhat who's providing medical aid who's providing the water who's providing the trucks that so far we haven't seen anywhere else we\nAired them yesterday on the news and why it matters in fact Sarah I don't know if we have this video but if we could play this a video or if you have it the the video of a these migrants being loaded up into giant semi trucks\nThey're being trucked from place to place from photo opportunity to photo opportunity\nAnd you pointed this out there that I I didn't notice it initially but there's there's women walking with strollers\nAnd it's like well a strollers not designed for a thousand mile walk down by like that's not how that happens in them or they're getting out there grouping up there for a couple of miles cameras get them then they get back in trucks and ... and they drew the draft look at\nThe ... video game ... video again please tell me how many women use spot climbing into the back of the semi truck\n[noise]\nJust count them even just count them as of right now you only have ... the ... well you know all of them counted right one all of them county was counting one one and he said and by the way just to clarify you want you want me to individually point out the women that are women that are quite a big crowd but the women that you can see that the one they're one and a on the um\n[noise] one Mm okay now so this isn't women and children who are these people\nAre we know that MS MS Thirteen now has embedded the people in to this group I mean now Seventy five hundred people\nAnd I want to play some audio uh this is ... let me see if I can get the right one uh\nYeah I think it's a I think it's CNN and Cuomo can you play this here on what the military is going to do\nWhat we look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement Rick if you put military down there we know with a God Forbid is in this situation and then how does it play\nHow was that good for anybody if 'cause you know you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting shot ... and what message does that send who wins\nAnd I don't think they're going to wind up in the country or reckon can I don't think that it has to happen that way but I'll tell you what if you have if you have a must happen what do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in wanting passwords for America can\nYes ... you're you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and to turn them away right there it's an invasion treated as an invasion turn way\nYou see this is an invading force these people they're not only legally [noise]\nNow the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is not an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away and I want you to listen\nTo all of the people on television that are now saying\nWe are a country that has always had open arms to migrants we're always the country that I mean our our values or have always our greatest strength is our tolerance and are welcoming spirit\nAnd that's the work that simply say puts into your system you own it and there is no contract for the monitoring and the monitoring is only fourteen dollars and Ninety five cents a month that's it\nYou get ten percent off your system and you won't believe how inexpensive it is it simply safe back dot com per ... per a protect your family\nOr and crust the company that we trust for our business and for home simply safe back dot com go there now simply safe back dot com [noise]\nPat Boone here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now not\nInto relief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain\nQuite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to\nAging exercise and everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking those nice long walks or\nPlaying golf or tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor maybe all you need to lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something\nYou need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start now only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more\nLet's see if we can get you out of paying to\nGo to relieve factor dot com wars coming\nIt's going to be so terrible and the dogs and cats living together mass hysteria it's going to result in massive economic losses even going to say oh my God I hearken back to the days of your what Obama was the president of the economy was limping\nAlong but at least we didn't have framed wars [noise] no\nNot the way this is going to go [noise] we already have our first major signal\nThat Trump is on [laughter] sixty six on the patriots am a let\n[noise] gland that [noise]\nYou know uh we had a we have ... we had the governor Abbott on with us and he said mixed inside of that seven thousand you know migrant caravan are\nMS MS Thirteen leadership and members embedded in there are these are actual gang rape is\nNow I'm waiting for the left I Can't wait for the left to pounce on this how dare you say that gang rapists are in that care of him when they had absolutely no problem\nCalling someone else a gang rapist without proof just recently not a problem I thought that was okay now I thought that was fine and with him is Thirteen they are getting rapists we know they are certainly\nSome of them are for sure well I think that's part of any anger and some of them are rapists yeah well I think that's part of the thing of\nGetting in you have to you have to rape to to join the rape and kill\nA pass on this year's the subscription I I I don't need the member shows are getting free though all you have to do I have no say\nNo thank you kill is what are they going to go a different direction okay is MS twelve available you know no no no they're found out [laughter] yeah yeah I mean that's a I mean you know we've talked about this before MS Thirteen the United states\nConstantly is is this is just the Donald Trump fever tree this is nothing it's not a big deal where they're killing people at four times the rate as of school shootings so if you think MS Thirteen isn't an issue you probably don't think school shootings or an issue\nWhich I tend to hear a lot of people on the left speak very loudly ... about school shootings when they go on and what exactly is that cause\nUh for them so I mean I like MS Thirteen the real issue I mean and this goes to a a deeper part of this which is\nYou it's not even if let's just say we thought they were all really good people we didn't know that there are any gang members in there that's to say that again come in that way you don't come in that way that you have to have a process to be able to decide whether people should come into your country or not\nThere's not are not hateful they've if you have a problem if you look at our if you look at you know a\nBlack Friday and say oh my gosh people are animals getting into a Walmart yeah\n... that's what this was going to be Seventy five hundred people try and just to push through an opening those doors\nThat's all I Do and I listen to Black Friday Wal Mart says it going to be fascinating to watch because you know there's a good chance that you know as as Greg Abbott talked about that you know Mexico doesn't want to deal with the pressure from the United states and the ... issue they're going to try to find a place to settle them within Mexico so it's a good outcome that are not on our borders because\nYou know what that is that's the Palestinian people\nYeah but we don't we don't know I mean I think the point of doing that it's not anger us right so you would think that they would do it in a way to avoid that and\nEdgar than UN's going to be very helpful\nAgain I mean the governor a tech I Know I Know that so I Know I I Know dumb reason to believe it's possible but let's see if it doesn't happen and they get here and try to over on the border\nThis thing is going to be a mess because you'll have the media making it look like our our border guard are are are National Guard of the worst people on earth and are not going to stand for it\nAnd like my job I got a van for Seventy five hundred people trying to run over I Hope our border guard either they're not an essay that is a that's got to be a real mess where he just goes way\nYeah that's how I deal with my problems while they go away it's really up to Mexico\nStopped them more lose all aid\nHolidays are coming what was the last time you sat around the table and really laugh\nWith your family I Know it's getting harder and harder isn't it I Want to give you two words say anything\nI'm not telling you to say anything because that's got us in trouble at the

way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com or something\nAnd likewise when they share something you guys been offending hum so it's really the app is I'm going to come out later this week on 'em\nAnd we will play and the app store but it's the twenty first century version of Drudge Report it is for conservative\nVideo content um that's out there that's being pushed to the side and and hidden by these tech company\nWhat platform you're keeping it all on what do you what do you mean you're going to Google Play I mean you're rowing going right into the hands of the beast or what are you doing to ensure that they ... they aren't um screwing with you and gathering information on on everybody\nElse while we were trying to do is I've heard a lot of people on our side say we need a conservative Facebook or we need a conservative Twitter yeah so what we're trying to do is find a realistic work around to the algorithm problem that's\nAnd on with some running conservative content so we said you know if we can find all these great conservative publishers and say hey here's what we wanted to do we can all benefit from this by sharing content into one place on the video side everyone can benefit\nUm so yeah we will be at the mercy of Google Play and the apple store [laughter] but I think this is a sort of the first step to be able to counter\nThat suppression from YouTube and Facebook so who do you have on board so far so we have a conservative review we've talked to Breitbart we had a great meeting with Prager you last week they're on board and obviously the blaze I Hope you guys come aboard as well\nAs the first time hearing of it but I Can't imagine we're not\nYeah so and what we're really doing is you know we're pulling the content from your Facebook page and from your YouTube so\nAh the blaze channel benefits because the view ... to you guys\nAnd the other thing that we wanted to do I'm In that's where we're already starting to be introduced to other people so we have these great young conservative filmmakers who put out an amazing video content and no one sees it on YouTube or Facebook and so we said hey will be the platform for that you go out and produce it and then we'll work with our team and our network to make sure that\nUm you know half the country that wants to see this content can actually see your content\nSo what do you think because I've done a lot of thinking on this uh first of all congratulations thanks um uh it is\nUm [noise]\nUh this is something that I have wanted to do for about eight years and I think conservatives are just now starting to say hey wait a minute what was that idea about coming together\nUm because they're starting to see the writing on the wall or in many different directions or so congratulations on doing that I fully support anybody who is trying to bring everybody together and protecting voices\nWhat do you say I'm to the objection that I have in my mind when people say we need a conservative Facebook\nNo we don't because that just puts us in another bubble right you know what I mean we need to be a if if it's known as a conservative thing only conservatives are going to go there\nSo how have you wrestled with that in your mind\nSo I think the first pick off for that was the Facebook documentary series that I did with the swamp so we had six members of the house Freedom Caucus and we followed them around the capital we've talked about the big issues plaguing DC\nWe had a liberal and progressive groups sharing that Facebook series So Tim Canova who ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz this is a\nBernie Sanders ... light shared the swamp episodes and said I encourage all of my followers to see this and we did it in a way where we didn't put you know Republican or conservative next to these guys named it was all about the content and\nThat's what a lot of these um younger conservative filmmakers are doing their libertarian leaning you know they're conservative leaning it's more about hey let's fix some of the big fundamental issues going on and then we can get into you know some of the more policy debates\nSo I think um that kind of content and then just presenting it in a really weak mobile application makes it easy for people to interact with the ...\nHave you ah have you seen what's happening in Brazil with a with a young libertarians you know they they are looking at America going\nYou know you can't sell that we can sell the libertarians to Staci into older and you know\nAll this freedom and talk that they're doing is not a not appealing to the the youth and they are making huge gains and headway because you know they're twenty somethings that have\nWho are are naturally attracted to freedom and said there's a better way to package this I think that's great\nAnd anything you're doing to encourage a you know twenty somethings to do that I think as time they take charge\nYeah I think so I think you know having the big conservative publishers on board um and does banding together you know with this program\nWe're going to find a lot of talented people out there who are you know frustrated who are amazing videographer is and filmmakers and go out there and shoot this content um and let them be the bridge to reach the next a conservative or libertarian generation\nSo you're the update dot com or let me let me I'm\nA switch topics with you because you know you've consulted a with candidates et cetera et cetera but do you think is coming our way to places first blue wave red wave no wave\nYou might as well flip a coin so I live I it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat so you know I talked to a lot of guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said oh it's you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing with the election is the media is getting so excited looking at this big national view but when you break down these individual races they are going to be far more competitive than what the media sang\nIt's always about local that as a the Kavanaugh saying coupled with Cortez coming out and saying you know capitalism stock got to be around forever the Democratic socialist the surrounding people while they're eating and shouting them down\nThey have the ... do you think the Democrats different than the leftist do you think that Democrats are waking up to holy cow who's in our bad\nYeah I was telling somebody earlier this week the orange he just needs to put out a video of all the people clawing at the door the Supreme Court there is a big divide I think between like the old school you know Democrats all my parents' voted democratic ... and you know continue to vote Democrats\nThan what's going on in D.C and people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker I mean these are radical left is when I was filming a with a swamp out in Iowa I was then rod belongs district and these are we went to a machine shop\nAnd these are life long you know Democrats a lot of them switched over to vote for President Trump but I'm Talking to him and they go oh you know I still you know identify as a Democrat voter side just rattle off a couple of issues and I'm like\nThey would have to break into your man you're you're you're no longer for in this Democratic Party right so yeah it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out two weeks away\nHow do how do you think the president and ah the Republicans should respond to this caravan coming up\nStop it\nI mean I think the president's made it clear where either a country of laws or not and\nYou know the the ruse that they're using that this is\nUh it's amazing how well the left uses terminology to try to convey people did their side\nBecause now they're asylum seekers you know their asylum seekers or their asylum seekers you apply for asylum in the first country that you arrived to which would be Mexico so it's not about that it's about getting to the United states is about sending money back to their country uh I don't\nEven know if it's about that these guys are\nThese guys are Marxist or that are upset at the the the the politicians in Honduras that kicked their Marxist a guy out who had ties to Venezuela and to Castro in Cuba\nThey've been trying to do all kinds of ... in in Honduras\nThere 'cause they're carrying the Honduran flag that these guys are Marxist radicals at least the leadership is\nI I Would have to imagine that if I was in a their situation if I was legitimately or refugee and I got to Mexico in Mexico was willing to hear my case or process may\nI Would wait in line for as long as it took the helm ... you know myself or my family for them to just break down the barricades and and charge the police officers in Mexico and say guys that you can't stop us we're going all the way to the United states and right you know singing Honduras national anthem\nYeah it's ... this is about politics and who's funding them yeah it's a great issue but\nI'm the president should stand strong and stop it if they make it that far [noise]\nAll right to be a the name of the ah athletes launching went this\nWeek launching this week you can go to the update dot com um give his email address and we'll send you early access end of this week when it hits both um the apple store and Google Play\nGreat thank you very much for coming by\nNobody's willing to look at that\nI don't know if you if you're a psychiatrist [noise] call me and tell me how I'm wrong on that but that cognitive dissonance\nTo have played a major room or at least a big role\nSmart when they talk about how the president has to be removed by the twenty Fifth Amendment they think they're savvy when they discuss the coming fascism in this country they're hysterical in muscle [noise] but they're also getting danger\nAnd they are really destroying some of
