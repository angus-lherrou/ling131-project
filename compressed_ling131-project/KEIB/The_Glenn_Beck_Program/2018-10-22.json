I was on a mission to find out a way to make drowning for these children survivable and because even when they do survive a there's a lot of traumatic brain injury\nUh we went to the convention in April talked to a bunch of people there and medical professionals\nAnd what we came up with is we needed to get emergency oxygen into the hands of first responders and not necessarily when they're on the track or in the ambulance back in their personal vehicle\nBecause for instance burglary and we're out in ... and the\nFirst person to show up with a volunteer fireman\nWas a couple of minutes away and hurt the call and the ambulance take twenty five minutes so all that time we didn't have oxygen and\nWhere I ended up passing and he didn't pass because his heart failed or his lungs even failed it weighs a lack of oxygen to the brain so I found the small twenty five minutes at emergency oxygen\nAnd and when I was talking to different chief of the Mad Men and fire departments in different medical professionals and their biggest concern was was that training for these people\nAnd but they thought it was a great idea to get deep into the hands of first responders and we want him to keep it though so when we came up with is\nA first date bag and that would hold the oxygen tank and we need to back big enough and set up for medical supplies and and everything so we came up with this what we call a hero bag\nBecause it goes to everybody's heroes our heroes\nAnd and it is a basic for steak kick it has anything from Tylenol and Bennett drill to any kind of guy there's a um a water bladder in there and\nBand aids iconic kit\nAnd anything that could think of because at least we put these together for their personal vehicles\nBecause a lot of times any smaller rural areas the or first responder is going to show up before\nThe ambulance does the ambulance and in towns around here the average is about six minutes and and\nThe brain starts dying at about six minutes so if it takes any longer and a police officer arrives or a volunteer fireman drive and they don't have anything and\nYou know they they can't do much better at this with the PR so we wanted to put these in the hands of those guys or when\nI like it you have a website I'm Sorry you have a website way deal Rory the warrior dot org R.

brilliant storytelling inspiring us to think differently making us laugh and helping us learn\nAnd Republicans got smoked two thousand ten or you had a sixty six percent Republican\nA percentage of people who are really interesting election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um you said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent or said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and\nWhat's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out again in this time in favor of the Democrats it started with a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats highest levels of interest in the election Republicans\nWas only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Saturday and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... since ... that has changed Democrats have gone up from\nThree to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance\nA very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid ... two dozen six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy it is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively so\nA relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of seats um there is a you know if you look at kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that that it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where the down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that than losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass democratic bills because they would either give each other on the train in the house you're still gonna have investigative power to have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of ... oh yeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance at this uh two months ago I mean they had\nA legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up or in some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the cabin I'll thing now I mean I think it's a real ... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling at the ... in an interesting group because they're not as passionate\nAs you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that's like of course a blanket robots typical I'm into doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until a cab and I was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and then they just want it makes them want to withdraw from\nPalo yeah but I Wonder because I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know where that four percent jump\nWas it a ... percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican\nJust because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not a registered member of any party nor will I ever be ... that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that's ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\nMm yeah I mean I Would think they discussed\nWith what's going on right [laughter] if anything they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting it was sad to hear Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\nWhat which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal sense night in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low a in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number is now jumped\nIn October of two dozen ... Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while it's not as high as in two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow uh and again that was a wave election for Democrats\n[noise] is it I mean\nThe only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan\nRefugees what else has happened\nI mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages you know I was in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were for it at some after okay um all the October ones obviously after including then include the migrants caravans situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only places low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen to thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine percent in two thousand sick\nI think it's more like fifty fifty right now that the GOP can hold the house and\nSaid yes and if they really going to all of a sudden

live in communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and build a better mouse trap rap or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left um they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution\nSo you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about\nPolitics but at what point do you see good people\nSay enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did a to Nancy Pelosi in California how are you aware of those did to Mitch McConnell it Elaine Chao in Kentucky exactly latter day\nBecause there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off their table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have\nPersuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and is standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta\nAnd taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the aunt is a phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing that I'm In\nI'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of ... restored downtown and I'm All right now\nAnd ah there's no end to fire here and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about and to today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media ecology in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans and it give it a week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that that basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week\nIt was an important content but it was shared content ...\nWas an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them\nPolitics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two they're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world\nIs so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like anti ... who are doing this to help\nProvide world collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do as a nor them [noise]\nSo what he is are are we I mean I've spent the last two years\nAnd the things that I can I continually come back to every single time is the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone\nYeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nSo yes ... a a player but soon I'm Out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech\nRight if protests all of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans\nWhich is we believe Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity\nThat's way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics\nIs this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature if you will out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness\nIs do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning when you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do\nIf those four things are true or even if three of the four true\nYou're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships\nAnd the undermining of vocation or long work um ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community and I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this ah and you're looking over the

has\nBeen I'm kind of around our studios for a while some of the guys had been taken relief factor here for a while a and I got to a place where my pain in the last few years have been it's just been

I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal\nHang of it before it surely some stuff started with me I should go into education absolutely\nI'm the one talking about getting rid of all standardized testing prior to high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because ... testing is it unfair way of getting teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding the funding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined where you should go where you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why it's to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do hear that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and almost by\nProud of Nineteen eighty there really wasn't a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about what he was ... they may do anything mhm somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read write survive in the world\nWithout at at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked\nAt the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nLet me give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some low class control and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready to start testing you will lose about we will lose in New York state we lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not into the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose that four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that four billion and there's lots of strikes which means administrators go away and then it shows while riding granted but it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one say nice things because I crossed the entire state might say that the the two counties I crossed all city to get the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more than a traders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shameful by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminish ... over a hundred and fifty\n... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve ... K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this\nBecause the first year of college for most kids is thirteenth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now he takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college west terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say I Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock\nI open the door if they're there they're hired\n... that's how bad it is for people to show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get a has a plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd ally is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind the desk and ... and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen that's not make some decisions\nIf I think called you right for me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator as life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves Dr teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who then we go back to the gate not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory data okay yeah so um so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and get to the great why should they be bored in school and they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things now where he's going to be a trade school\nGo to trace could become a plumber carp and do whatever you want to be about mechanic an H ... guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I let my ... year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work\nThey should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in New York City doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that go get a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen and lots of people in my generation I deserve to go work learn what it means to have a boss lieutenant means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learned that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nA lot of these sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelve right I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here you're sixteen you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck\nHis ... his wife ... going to happen a bunch of cool prep schools will pop up\nA bunch of great trade schools will pop up get that much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars going day well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will actually give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when these schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year these last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each\nTwelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders is more than four billion dollars we said all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made\nName recognition is my only issue the last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition and with that I pulled that\nThirteen percent so you can do the math on that one three times to get to a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through time Thirteen or ... percent this is a five way race thirty percent when this thing\nSo I'm nine points above victory assuming I get a hundred percent there is the hard part right the math equation cannot get two hundred percent and sadly that's not my message I've got that down it's the media can I get\nMy name out to enough people to where I cross over that barrier which gets to be over thirty per se I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win yes ... I guess really is that well again you can remember as third party in general the system is that against you\nAnd some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this because every day I'm up against failure\nBut the marine corps taught me take the hill the captain shot take the hill the machine guns broken take the hill radios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses take the hell I get it and that's what I Do have to take the hill as a matter\nI get I literally deal with failure everyday disappointment every day and when I say that that's not an exaggeration\nThat's every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS and they're only going to include the Democrat Republican\nEven though I'm On the ballot even those thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS they got him ... his name he there was decided nope lottery shop dozens of beyond their he's decided that the establishment as all that matters this is what I'm up against it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle we have to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that uh you think should be heard than you should probably\nUm maybe tweet\nStorm what's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think that was ...\nSo this is a radio debate yes well there's gonna be televised also now okay we both televised on radio ... okay so yeah again and they're just deciding now we don't want the dummy wrong there are three other people should be made should also be the Green Party and also the damn party they should all be there\nBut this is the norm and we put up against this\nWeb against is constantly and here's the worst part\nWith all of this we're still roaming and they're still going down that's that's the sad part they don't they don't they don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate how's he\nDoing Larry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you

uh you know that feels like the old Soviet\nSize styles centralized system is beyond me but I'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um\nYou are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit\nEspecially when it comes to the second amendment a and trying to de platform or people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally an ethical for governor to impede business\nPeriod no ifs ands or buts if I don't like an industry or like something I never said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief\nI should be the marketer and chief not not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's always\nNot only doing that he's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and winds up happening more than ... more than more than often is normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around his edicts right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants insurance forest fire on\nNow we can't get it\nThere's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more\nWell how do they need insurance now when\nWhen when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore\nFor any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yeah and that's the unethical part that's the issue right and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in ...\nState it's by default a violent felony by the fault no matter what you do that's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we're having a gun if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant\nSay fact was passed in twenty Thirteen and the the fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal ... literally ... what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before a complete legally totally above board you are now a violent felon it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nMatch okay this is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes oh the cops words that have been revamped of all because of that in other words but it now if you're retired cop once you retire well now you're a felon again\nBecause you know we're not going to come up\nThis is this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy constantly project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a businessman\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years and I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we've lost over ... million since he's attended thrown over a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million\nLook they're voting with their feet right in it\nYes it's so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and their pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent in New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is\nYes so let's take pension style true pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's\nNo way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises ... who work their whole life and were promised ally yep what do\nYou see it here in Texas would you please for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas she's already already happening I may have all the time you're in New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation mhm so pension is a critical right now pennies are about Fifteen or sixteen percent of our budget
