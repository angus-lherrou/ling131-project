a burglar tried to [noise]\nFox News it was his criminal past that got him caught\nA percentage of people who are really interested in watching only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um it's the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent\nSaid they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until Kavanaugh you had sixty three percent of Democrats high levels of interest in the election Republicans\nWas only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible since capital that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance a very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight votes\nThose numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two dozen six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy it is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen [laughter] is this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and\n... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nNow for a relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican lost in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you look at kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is they've Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's that's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in\nA band they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is we know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're\nUnderdogs by more than one point they will win some place where there was a down by five in the polls winning some of those races so the split it's going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that's been losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president so it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting she fled and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other over the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power going to have a\nPoster nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of oh yeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nNo I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had\nA legitimate paths to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up or in some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat they had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's a real a real it's really going\nTo come to the independents how are the independence\nFeeling ... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten we're at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest and then partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that type of course a blanket robots typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with them and they don't they don't like either side and then they just want it makes them want to withdraw from\nPalo yeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump was it a four percent yup or to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone in\nSaying right now and there's a lot of independence that I that I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever the ... was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way it anytime between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more of\nThis one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah I mean\nWould think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting this out of here Glenn if we could yes I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\nIs ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about ... a lot about this Huh Interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal sense in ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen who was forty one percent very low\nOr in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen Eighteen Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while they were not as high as in two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that was a wave election for Democrats\nIt's the I mean the only thing I can think of is\nThe Guatemalan refugees what else is happening I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied\nMinors situation where they're being quote unquote held in cages in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently yeah I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were for it outside after okay um all the October ones obviously after ... men include the migrants a caravan situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it ... the only place it's low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four\nThere at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine percent in two thousand sick so it is our whole lives that this is\nNow America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a

[noise]\nThis is Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\nI'll talk a little bit about this back and forth with Saudi Arabia because it is important that we get this right and we don't make this about American politics we should make this about American interests but not American politics\nRight now people are saying I came away Donald Trump or\nDon't you know what George Bush Bill Clinton the second George Bush all the way back all the way back to FDR we have been in bed with the Saudis\nI don't like this I think we're in bed with really bad people\nThese are rattlesnake a bad pet that was asked me once and I love this is a rattlesnake is it a bad bet\nThe answer is no so perfectly fine pet as long as you always remember it as a rattlesnake or a snake and not a little puppy dog\nIt's a rattlesnake ... not a bad bet just don't pet it and don't try to a fashion a leash a little leash around its neck take it for a walk it ain't gonna do it\nSo how do we handle Saudi Arabia well it should be the same way we handled turkey but we're not because we're looking at turkey and Saudi Arabia with American eyes stop it\nThese are both Islamic states now their warring with each other why\nBecause one is Muslim Brotherhood and one is a ... hobby is they don't like each other they want death\nFor everybody in the other state they want the regime of Saudi Arabia [noise] Saudi Arabia stopped [noise] turkey because they're Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi Arabia Webster key stopped\nBecause there will hobbyists we're\nBeing put in the middle of a fight between to Islam assist both of them want the caliphate both of them want Islamic rule both of them want to rule uh with jihad and they also want to rule which Rio law\nWe don't\nWe don't want any either of those so now let's put this into perspective Saudi Arabia horrible place horrible horrible horrible horrible place they execute kids\nAs long as you've shown any kind of signs of puberty you're tried as an adult they execute through beheading ... there was a woman who was raped gang raped by seven men not sure if one of them was Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh yet\nA about a Saudi were woman was gang raped by seven men\nThey each got you know between two and nine years in prison however she she received six months in prison and two hundred lashing ... with a whip\n\nBecause she was in the car without a without her husband and then she dared to take her story to the media is the kind of people that we are dealing\nWith the crown prince you\nAnd I are not going to like this guy\nYou didn't say oh look at what he's still he's he's making it easier for women to drive without their husband yeah okay yeah\nSure sure sure he's still a hobbyist\nLet's look at what\nBoth sides in this country have done [noise]\nWe're currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia we are involved in their war in Yemen did you even know that\nPresident Trump announced a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia last year it was President Obama that vetoed a bill that allowed families of nine eleven victims to sue the Saudi Government\nSo both sides everybody is in protecting these guys when the crown prince came here to

that you can go live in the communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and build better mouse trap or app\nOr where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left\nUm they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution so you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics\nBut at what point do you see good people say enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end ... what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did\nA to Nancy Pelosi in California than a hundred percent agree weirdos did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao and Kentucky exactly latter day because there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off the table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have\nPersuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing\nThat I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown to sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now and are there is no anti ... hair and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about anti ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media ecology in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that that basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it was shared content\n... there was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two they're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world\nIs so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like and to her do who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignored them\n[noise] so what he is are are we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the things that I can I continually come back to every single time is the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone\nYeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nYes ... or ... sued 'em out of the many ...\nAnd right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion\nFreedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right if protests all of those things flow from the fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe in law go day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity\nThat way bigger than their policy preferences\nAnd so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forth and statistically the number one driver of happiness\nIs do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning when you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do\nIf those four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less\nAnd so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work um ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this\nAh and you're

real reason we need to take that Russia type investigations so seriously us because China's right behind them\nRunning scout team often I'm On that meant ready to do\nBig the fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions\nAbout geography about race about gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kinds of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they\nTry to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL dealing controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media and the for Seventy two hours after that flamed\nLast fall the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taking the NFL most of it was Russia on both sides and so we're gonna have a world where you're going to have things like the Kavanaugh hearings where all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer strategizing with Michael ...\nOr video will appear it'll be fake but video will appear and it'll be Kavanaugh partying hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake\nBut in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be a potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them a why we hate each other is an awareness that there is actually national security exposure for this country and how much we hate each other around politics\nWe need communities of people that live\nIn the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise] [noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some that job somewhere at a McDonald's right now who probably slap to an old man wearing a bog a hat\nAnd uh that person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of ... pecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have well we've got thirties I'm about thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you I'm not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a Ben and and really unpack this um because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood\nAnd I think in soundbites um it's not to not

agree with that now that you know that's not something you'd be interested in\nIts fair yeah um\nAnd we kind of forget about who this guy he is I mean voted with Donald Trump eighty seven percent of

is is is not protection so he's the one being consistent there or you know whether you know I Know a lot of people have changed on that at some level\nUm but still I mean we're seeing the effects of this in the middle of the country right now the terrorists are very harmful to the economy is about to get worse or the spending bill\nHe voted against the Trump Administration saying though I mean I

crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life liberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about this I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness\nSorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there there are many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal hang of it before it sure such lift started with me I should go into education absolutely I'm the one talking about getting rid of all centralized testing prior to high school\nI Know and talking about doing that because then writes testing is it unfair way of bringing teachers\nIs an unfair way of rewarding schools\nAnd it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy satellites testing is very good when you're in high school and joined where you should go where you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why it's to keep control of what's happening in the schools I'm not okay with that\nNow you have a bit of gray hair as I Do here that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was the department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information and he was ... they may do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states some help on how to read write\nSurvive in the world without at at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked\nAt the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nLet me give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some low class control and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready so nice testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion so losing four billion not in the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows were writing granted but it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive\nWhy regulations rules checking boxes I'm the only ones saying these things because I cross the entire state might say that the the two counties I crossed off if you do\nI'm going to fool sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually wants to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders than teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shameful by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average ministry makes over a hundred and fifty among you dump a couple of minutes raiders you hide my teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve neat K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids it's thirty eighth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years for the average kid to graduate college\nWas terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say I Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally not people who were telling me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one or aren't you know told me he said Laurie my interview process is very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is for people show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course\nAt sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get high school diploma number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told a lie\nAnd ally is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk in front and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen list that makes them decisions if I think cause you write to me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go to years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready and graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fans love\nI'm a doctor who have not sure about the new doctor you know being a female but that's a different story\nNow he'll get yes [laughter] so um so that kid who's really smart that could take the SATs right away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be bored in school and they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things now where he's going to a two year trade school go to trace become a plumber or a comment or whatever you want to be about mechanic H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I let my ... year old I'm fifty a ... year old\nMy problem is they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough and you know she's doing it's a problem so do that we don't like that could get a job\nWhy not go learn a work work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people might you know if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nAllow it sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth\nI'll pay for the last two

person you're old enough that they don't weigh register online and only\nParticipants ah for for New York\nOr she is libertarian and uh is making waves in New York and he's a voice that you should hear because his his policies are different than the Republican and the Democrat and I believe they're very very workable in a\nIn an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system uh you know that feels like the old Soviet size styles centralized system is beyond me but\nI'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um\nYou are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment\nA and trying to de platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for a governor to impede business\nPeriod no ... no ...\nIf I don't like in the industry or like something I never said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief I should be the marketer and chief not not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's always\nNot only doing that he's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around as he decks right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants to insurance forest firearm\nNow we can't get it there's no way that the individuals and there are at least for me and I'm gun owners in New York state if not more widely in the insurance now\nWhen when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore for for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yes and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by default no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight\nAnd we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe acts compliant say fact was passing twenty Thirteen and the fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal literally ... what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before completely totally above board you are now a violent fell and\nIt was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes oh the cops words that have been revamped it all because of that in other words but it now if you're retired cop once you retire well now you're a felon again\nVision of them are not good at ...\nThis is this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy constantly project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a business man\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired ... that's what he's done we've lost over ... million since he just had thrown over a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet\nRyan it's yes it's so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they are pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and he's pension is now aren't being spent the New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions though ... pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises jak people who work their whole life and were promised ally yup what do you do\nYou see it here in Texas would you please for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas
