around um\nYou know McDonald's shooting was so so different from what what the population was asking us to believe that however are being asked to try and and Brett Kavanaugh when I listen to 'em Donald Trump's speech I think it was to tonight and most of the city when he was\nMocking Dr Ford and talking about why it is that we should support judge Kavanaugh's nomination she kept coming back and back again to have just have it all live perfect\nAlly oh my gosh you went to Yale he says it's over\nAnd over and he was a perfect life he went to yeah we had kids he has a white and of course the question because the thing I think the same of the way it is like the Enron\nWas an attorney grain he said he has he said he's a perfect person because he finished at the top of his class I mean it it will lead to them is just on here and should but you know what it's always been there right\nNow that I Would say the thing about it too is that what he's talking there was no accident he went to Mississippi here that says there's a U.S Senate race in Mississippi\nAnd so you also have that and and with my cancer they write a novel if that's going on is not really dog whistles they really out loud loud\nHere from bowl\nOn [laughter] you know it's so good so ... myself reminded me of level of\nOn the phone from the south or this that and how white people think\nAh that that that I grew up with an even now and you look in the audience you're not just seeing grandpa because you're in the sun and the and the daughter is in a new generation of white supremacy bean or develop before our very eyes of how they think about\nWhite privilege and and write down the nation in this country that's why I keep going back to that because at the end of the day\nThey did not care more calm on them

at the polls that Larry saying that it's going to the polar opposite of the exclusion of the others when it comes to live the way people talked about it and that\nReally much is what I'm concerned about where white women's heads are what we say white women may change what they're thinking like if you're still faces about white male domination and your role in it you won't you won't vote for the African\nDistributed among the Wilson Center Collins said something to this woman was was was wasn't Kevin Oh my God I mean how much money he can you believe that\nWell they were using the blackout to me that several times over ... going so I wouldn't know justification I've got a minute before we go to rate jumped on it and whoever it is\nI mean I think that what's been pretty much habitat again what we find it out there and fix stance was that you can run a campaign he ran an election that says don't vote for that guy he's a bad guy and I'm a better first as\nAlways on twenty sixteen is that enough Hillary Clinton being less fat than Donald Trump\nWhether or not to get a vote or they can get people to stay home without that with more and more he's like a lot of white voters they didn't say like coming out support him it's not like they fled to the Democrat and so what I'm afraid of in the fall and the author of positive incentives and in this in pointing out how terrible the party is backing down by capping off\nWe're going to end up in a situation where maybe voter voting as a little depressed but we're not going\nTo have enough people inspired to turn out for our side and so we need to be able to connect these issues into positive prescriptions at the Democratic party can actually offered to our own people and not just talk negatively about the other side\nAnd when we get

people have applied for a vote by what they called vote by mail ballots and people will receive them at home you take your time to pick out who you want to vote for\nIn a Denver for example they have a one hundred percent voting record now you know they mail a ballot to every single registered voter in that city and people returned pilots when they get them and they use for the call vote centers\nAnd at these votes in is a place to teach ugly around so it doesn't get rid of the polling places split for example you could go into a library and there is a ballot box that is\nProtected and has cameras on it and you just drop the ballot in that box so you don't even have to depend on the post office and it's called vote by mail\nMetal on metal no one was down ... on the ground in
