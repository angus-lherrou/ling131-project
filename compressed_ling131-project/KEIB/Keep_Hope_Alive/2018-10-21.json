the radio and when you get on social media people trying to give you these arguments about why they're not voting\nAnd those arguments really do make a lot of sense when you analyze them but he will feelings are real and we don't know the extent to which social media is being used and abused to influence\nPublic opinion and to that but what people say things like the system is racist black America that never gotten that bad shape I don't want to participate in our raises but what that I'm ignores from from my perspective I think is that\nHe came when you're not in the gang and if we ever going to change it we need more voting not man I\nI agree but let me just add a little bit um [noise]\nPeople respond to the local here there are roads are not being tend to get the garbage isn't being picked up if all they see as a police car rolling through the neighborhoods that they have living in bad housing that we all know that boating can change a lot of that\nBut in a lot of these cities like I live in a city that has a majority black county and city council\nTo resources don't come to the side of the city that I'm On and so people do use that as a reason not to get engaged which means that we have to penetrate an organization is organizational people those communities to convince people to re engage in the process\nBut you know you can win in the ... going on in the
