district the eye and caused me rather than Vietnam and civil rights and clay and I mean I I've grown up\nWith that and things have gotten better if we have we've had progress but we can't forget me think about it who who who does America drop bombs on who we dropped bombs in World War two right people of color\nAnd what kind of government said we support the government steps the press freedom of speech and basic freedoms for people and so now we have a president\nWho is an open white nationalist who who came into office with Steve Bannon and then what's the Steven Miller who expelled white nationalism first thing they did\nWas to go after most loved and what the what what bio ... and then to go after Mexican migrants what language to go after black football players ... file language\nIs a it's it's I've seen this before but I Know this could not in well the people who are the thirty percent of America elected basically mobster president now what you see lobster like acts by his followers\nThat's exactly right then can I just follow up\nOn that please go for a ...\nIf one goes back and study the rhetoric that Timothy McVeigh who up until nine eleven had committed the worst\nTerrorist attack in the United states history if one goes in studies the rhetoric he employed to justify his murder of all of those uh innocent people including children in Oklahoma is now interchangeable with the rhetoric of President Trump\nOr if it was one of a far right fringe idea\nNow it's coming from the White House and beginning in the Obama administration we saw a tenfold increase of militia groups hate groups neo Nazi organizations a radical right wing armed and dangerous so called patriot groups\nAnd one of the things ... said when he attempted\nTo recruit someone to his cause in the nineties was\nA man with nothing to lose is the most dangerous thing in the\nWorld faster Lewis reading recorder yup oh yeah and we see that with a lot of these are fervent Trump supporters in the far right radicals their unmarried there are childless\nAnd they're unemployed or marginally attached to the labor force and that's what we saw this week with the killers who perpetuated these acts in Kentucky in Pittsburgh and the bombings so it is going to get worse it is going to get worse and ah\nIt's something that we all need to be very cognizant start to be vigilant about that's how we cannot take this lightly\nMhm I think that's right I think there's also one other piece that we're missing so far so based on our Twitter poll there are a decent number of people who disagree with us and then they say you can also blame the left yes I'm for kind of the increased I'm not just the actions but also just the the rhetoric has a whole\nHere's what you can't blame the less for is that the man who killed eleven people yesterday had Twenty one firearms registered to his name\nYou walked in within a are Fifteen and you cannot disagree with that those on the right have done everything that they can to make sure that if you were ever to commit something like this that he would have access to Twenty one firearms and he didn't break a single law until you actually walked into that building started shooting and killing somebody\nYou know what I I must admit when the ... what they named the fella that are sending out the pipe bombs are posted a got a lot of pushback\nPosted don't believe that like I won't say the the word I said thank God you're so want to be crazy the word because because you had a bit of black person Muslim or someone\nFrom the last one you wouldn't be in custody frankly they know that you know why why did it last\nNight we know that the person that we're sending to bomb was why\nAre they going to kill him well and\nWas one person not a whole group right because remember when they were looking for the the the gentleman in Boston who said\nThey killed his his his pregnant wife Charles somebody I forget his name and um they locked down the black part of Boston mhm they locked down looking for this black person is black man he said he killed his wife course he killed his wife but that's another\nThat's another story

put any policies in place that protects you to look out for you get your cheering him [noise]\nReally really going to get a car and drive and you and those that will come behind you correct them dramatically but what is their thinking\nI mean really what do you what do you think because\nI don't I wouldn't want to I Want to some of his entrepreneurial America may be worshipping older capitalism on and they were buying into\nThis high me money move and that has made the economy better and I'm sure there have been targeted to be the representative that type of entrepreneurial\nBut wait a minute it'll capitalism orange agreed I mean I can tell your regulars printed and that's what I'll do that even\nThough he did all random doesn't actually know how to do these things but The Apprentice\nPut him in the light of all read right and as Grenier a good thing and look how much money I have and look you could be this too and I I still think that's why there are so many people that do support him right now as president even though like you said Kevin Greg who's doing everything against all these people but\nThey see it's still The Apprentice was coming out as soon as I could be me aspirational and that but many right which gets like God yes David\nAre just very quickly it's just like John Steinbeck shut off for the grapes of wrath [laughter] he said in America a

vote him you know that they'll vote on November from the average about our lives at the end it on this boat and you know I I I think you and I think wherever the acts up all that you do I\nMean you know he's done a lot and I know he ran and he's getting lots of votes but you know there definitely is a call it the accent and you know I'm going to say the parade and the one thing about armed guards I attended church here in Cincinnati Thomas I'm proud that they have are they have they have police officers like police officers and it's one of the state does the violence now\nNow do we know they would please make you feel more safe in church how do you feel about having the police in church you know I'm ...\nI'm On bothered by the police being tried to understand that because there's I mean this is the biggest church so um I you know I\nI look at all I Am here and I'll feel safer I just feel like okay they're part of it but I Do appreciate appreciate the fact that we have them here go figure and I'm you know the toxic toxic administration there were shocked at the at the\nEnd by everybody would go up and tell you that I don't want people to shoot him what everybody will be good bothers me\nWell you know and I to tell you I think that we don't want us to put all of the ills historical ill of our great country on this administration\nWe've been sick a long time trying to get well there's also been sick and we didn't we just see we've been slave and we've been free\nDisallowed would not allow women the right to vote and then we did I mean it's just what we\nAll live in the middle\nOf America America of exceptionalism what we're going to be based on slavery kidnapping\nAnd that's why I was making the point with Keli let's not you don't don't move off the shores\nToo fast let's deal with the sickness and we've been grown here Broadway here and more people to live with Reverend Jesse Jackson stay right there David I'm let you come right on back and we've got past ... years and jumped out at six day writing more [noise]\n\nYour opinion one eight six six by nine four oh one in five nine for three\nFifty one eight six six by nine for for six seven three\nEverybody keep them alive with Reverend Jesse Jackson I'm Sandy jacks and you're going to get more on this conversation tomorrow night biking yes yes ma'am where we're going to became then this in even more on cut [laughter]\nThey lose just a tad didn't just attended anyone in the Chicago land area should drop by it's going to be a pearls place at thirty nine of oneself Michigan yes that's right it's going to be fun ever going to try and our Facebook Kevin in and maybe pasture you read in the\nPast if there's going to be there so we're going to happen if we were trying to lead a reasonable price that's really a good food that you've got to pay for yourself\n[laughter] that's why they support is just ... you know and I will say this is my friend James Ryan you have this business for quite some time Jay Jay are well I call them Jimmy is that the south and years ago but he went into this area before gentrified gentrifying now\nBut we went to school about ten blocks from there\nAnd so he has an affection for the area and ah when it was an area in decline he said let me open up this restaurant\nA nice sit down restaurant\nUm for the people in the neighborhood has become you know neighborhood institution\nBut let me go to you David ... boy we've had and thank you Facebook flies are family because we have some fun with them today and he asked you to mark lovers come around and we love you take your phone today David mass you until you were making a point\nYes you're absolutely production in what you were saying before the break all the Donald Trump does not the disease she symptomatic of the disease she is an\nIllustration and expression of American values of Joe Biden said that Donald Trump is putting American values to Schroeder but those of us with some historical literacy with all due respect to the former vice president know that Donald Trump as a manifestation\nOf this country's a clear history and continue will practice of\nRacism classes I'm a massage unity show but Martin Luther king junior is also an American leader was expressing some American values or we have the rover and Pat Robertson we'd have the Reverend Jesse Jackson so\nAmerica is a multiplicity of countries are on a collision course with one another and this week we surveyed some of the wreckage that is resulting from that collision\nOr the great historian Howard Zinn said you cannot be neutral on a moving train the train the trains are moving toward one another and then that movement is demanding\nOur participation in our move toward correction and right now it appears that there aren't too many Americans are allowing themselves to drink the poison of apathy and my hope is that we'll have some positive indication on the midterms\nIf these early voter registration numbers bear out but I wanted to emphasize the validity and value of your insights cheated a Trump is not the cause of the problem or she is a manifestation of problem\nAnd we're not looking at all of the ingredients in that soup [noise] I mean when have you ever seen the CEOs and the chairperson of the biggest corporations on earth leave their jobs to run the government mhm I mean\nWhat's really going on something out of us here I mean whoa 'cause it 'cause that's where the power is mhm so I mean a ... year we've been we've had a rabbis Gordon and reads on a our Jewish rather than a weighing in on this\nHorrifying tragedy in Pittsburgh yesterday at the tree of life\nThe tree of life\nCongregation eleven people killed six person wounded and the whole nation with the whole world is ... ... right we're we're all in mourning wouldn't it let's not forget the two people killed a Kroger right field in clover we get killed so often you know\nAt the white man who walked out bumped into a white witness who saw him with a gun he had a gun\nAnd the white witness thought he was an active shooter guy he said oh no no no no wait a minute you don't worry white people don't care white people just I'm not I'm not going to hurt you know he didn't just he he just said why people don't know why people because the man's son was on television reporting it he was disgusted by it\nAnd then the fourteen bonds of course Maxine Waters got who passed you're getting your ironic that the fingerprint came from the bomb that was that the lord that's Maxine doing it again you know you go to the max needed to see the hot mess passed you're hearing\nIs rare the um the sadness of the tragedy from yesterday is just another reminder of kind of this cyclical decline that we find ourselves in as a nation\nA Donald Trump while he is a symptomatic of a different condition he is just the most current symptom he's not the only historical symptom that we've sing\nAnd so there comes a time when there's a a galvanizing or a polarizing figure\nThat inspires the rest of us to decide what are we going to do are we going to sit idly by and ... are in this situation or or are we going to a rise up and take a stand and say that our moral center is stronger and more important than what we've seen\nA from from the other side so I think blaming the president gives the president too much credit we know the undercurrent of the hostility of ah just long standing white supremacy that goes all the way back to the founding of the nation has just taken on a twenty first century variant\nOr in terms of its presentation a and recent uh you know demonstrations in terms of who goes to the federal courts and the assaults on inclusion as an American principle it's just an indication that the nation is still mad the entitlement class still upset\nSince brown v board was half the fact that you would have folks in business leading the government that's called an oligarchy\nOligarchy has come to power and who else there there are now or in real time three or ... by my last count trillion dollar corporations [noise]\nOne is apple the other was Amazon the third is the United states government and so folks would leave their jobs because where else can you go to influence the distribution of over a trillion dollars of interest and if you get to determine who gets to benefit from that interest\nThen you're at a pretty influential position and how else do you make your peers beholden to you\nThen to find yourself in a position where they now need you to do something on their behalf\nBut no no stay right there ... because that's what I'm trying to get to because while we are looking at President Trump with looking past the people who got him there\nYou know what I was living in the river and I'm thinking well by definition of fake news would be that people are on national television on having this discussion that we're having laying it out that that is not all about Donald Trump\nIt's about the condition of the nation from start start to where we are now", "show_name": "Keep Hope Alive", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "28"}
