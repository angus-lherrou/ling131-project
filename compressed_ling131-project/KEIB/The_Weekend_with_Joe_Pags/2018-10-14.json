great thank you for having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole thing like friday because people know I was actually and this was unfolding on me or live you're listening but I was telling them what was going on and and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew\nWho said heights or a pale in a bigger kids up and dropping kids often and I'm listening just want to see a good point they should ... you've got a famous name and correct me if you're a teacher was do you remember what you said you said it's really me I promise\n[laughter] to\nGo back and forth that when I

in la listening [laughter] I don't know what I'm trying to verify me\nWhile I tried to verify the few ways when I got the email back from Sarah ... dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I said you have an iPhone let me face time you must you settle this once in a row and if it good as we got to go to the fake you so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing hot zone [laughter] by that time out of the vehicle and we're all in all the button to try to figure out how to say that\nAnd it worked out 'cause you brush the boat you took my first time in ... her son Tina Fey that's her that's not no you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sir I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator\nAs a write in really so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican I Can't support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she says you couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDo the people of Alaska except that excuse\nNo and go back even further from her writing campaign after he lost the primary up here remember what's her Senator Frank were kept yeah after having served twenty two years in the U.S Senate he gave his daughter the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on German and I ran against him into heated yep that's how we got and that's how we stayed in essentially command once you're in and you have these special interests from around the country right up funding you\nYou know you have to it's tough to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough\nTime to go but no rational reason that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again cabinet because as you point out sheet that a good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know about like of course it is and whether either good manners\nYes I Do know that it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as you suggested it outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy just for the state of Alaska you for this country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its grass happened did you what are called ... the our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nShe was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate but you know you are you're white was up in our circuit court of appeals that I'll I'll repeat that in the second ... opinion of course the former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course\nThe former governor of Alaska and just a great all run person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain is going to write in my mother's name until you got on the ticket\nAnd then I voted for you so and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states\nThe Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um the law issues of Alaska\nAnd what are you in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members that are just hard for the foreign almost everyone would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment check amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska where they make you think\nThat that's exactly right and Joe I was so impressed because nobody else was talking about that they share what her action was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the nights circuits out of\nSan Francisco right he talked about injustice and\nJustice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nThe second largest the eleventh and they are only serving thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power\nAnymore say over Alaska so for at least to be messing around with that uh that was very very dangerous another thing is that President\nTrump President Trump saw the lights and is allowing Adam are only two decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has\nI think that that that gets more become unhinged I I think the more that and reasonable rational Americans which is the majority we said\nEnough is enough of that and we're going to get in there we're going to put government back on our side get it off our back we're going to follow the constitution constitutions all about\nLimiting government that we can govern ourselves and I think people like you have to get to be out there every day in the arena and make it different where you guys still keeping\nOkay we're going to do that as Sarah thanks a million along with millions of other Americans I voted for you two thousand eight I'd vote for you in a heartbeat again I really appreciate your reaching out and thanks for taking their time today\nThank you so much cricket you\nWe appreciate Sarah bailing take a bit of time you know it was interesting how we ended up connecting she's riding around in Alaska\nAnd listens to my program every day we're on it you know in in Anchorage I'm guessing that's where she hears it we're also on in a in Fairbanks but to have the opportunity to talk to her and she really doesn't have a similar if not even worth story been cabinet does because Kevin only had to put up with it for three weeks or or ten or eleven days\nWhere Sarah Palin had to put up with it for more than a year and her family to the microscope and just the the craziness from the left him and the lawyer showing up\nIn Alaska her perspective really made a lot of sense to me and I look I Hope she runs give Lisa Murkowski\nLisa Murkowski in my opinion do not represent the people of Alaska which he voted no on Brett Kavanaugh I'm the reason she gave was because he's not the right guy at the right time which

doesn't matter what I Do to another human being because I have to have the power and that was so important I I couldn't put it in my book you know why we fight because it happened off they came out yeah but when the president stood out\nIn the White House two days ago in front of the world\nAnd pulled out the Democrats for the evil things they did that justice Kavanaugh and thin pronounce the

even before World War one and World War two where this sort of fascism has been known to be on the left we just have pretended through history that didn't happen that way but but let me let me ask you about why we're so successful and I have an idea as to why\nBut but I'll ask you more more specifically\nWas it so successful because the right always cow town gave in and again you just have outlined it incredibly this president said I'm not giving you this justice cabinet\nDecided I'm not going to give it I'm not going to allow them to do this to me but is that why it's lasted for probably the better part of a century because the right always gives in and\nPull the nominee or or bend over backwards for the left\nI'll tell you what I saw when I was in the White House so I I I had very quickly I developed the reputation the White House and a lot of people especially the press department said I I miss the strange why\nBecause I refused I just refuse flat out from day one to talk to the the fake news I I ... I didn't care whether it was washed the post ... ... and it I said no why would I tool to people who wish to destroy this president I'm ready to talk on record or off wreck all the trouble is\nThe majority of the establishment until the Kavanaugh hearing\nThe majority of establishment the geo peace than it is that the the the bureaucrats in the in the White House\nThey want the joke they want the approval of the New York times why they want the approval of CNN this is the problem and you know why that is so ridiculous number one they wish to destroy us look at what they've done for the last two years and secondly who cares\nAbout CNN yeah the you know I I Know just because of the White House book as you know how many people watch the most quote unquote important show on CNN every night\nAnd listen to what I have no you know how many people know OK so Sean Hannity crush it like he is the ... my colleague at all it's yes he is the king millions and millions and millions of us every show\nAnd the ... the star of the Clinton used that work Monday Night his show gets six hundred thousand view is\nAnd that somehow they're showing record Dr Gorka how how is it that people and your rights people on the establishment right people in the swamp on the right or afraid of what Anderson Cooper will say about them\nRight where we have three hundred and twenty five million people in this country yeah less than half a percent what's what's Anderson Cooper if they were paying ... ... and we now they we now do they pay if they were paying the CNN to be broadcast in America's airports that'd be three people including\nSome who are watching this show is is what\nWe have to break the geo ... the approval of these people but I Know what last friday did you watch the press conference by the Republican senators\nWho ... who was actually in power and yeah\nThey were angry I have never seen them so angry at the Democrat so that is costing behavior so you know what I think something's changed but everybody\nBe deadly serious the midterms are the most important election of our lives don't take it for granted go to vote take your friends to vote if you like the last two years and you want six more we have to win the mid ...\nIs Dr Sebastian Gorka the name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies one last quick question I always appreciate the access in the friendship thank you until she said all of our friends as well um it will do when it comes to left versus right politics I just saw\nAnalytical master's program from the W.

that is desired around the world and the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIs the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talking to trade talk and delivers that are that the president has and and he's putting it on me you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining ... putting terrorist is going to ruin trade and in no time flat\nBiggie you stepped up and said we're making a deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade him in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas now are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the bill how does that go down\nYeah he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet for the as the secretary of treasury\nMnuchin and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross gale have a a a role to play and that and and uh so I absolutely there's a there's there's good and a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's on the same\nTeam I Want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know ... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\nA true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen\nIf I trade yet and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals where he comes with some really hard stuff I mean you think about with you and then a ... and came back in here uh after they laid out some really tough or a sanction Iran sanctions but tariffs it retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so that the Chinese ... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the tariffs originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose a\nThey know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese don't lose a trade war with us so yeah\nI guess we're the biggest customers they don't want to screw with us that would lead them\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property rights of good neighbor\nYeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you're in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming under the guidance of a great guy but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally\nGot to see what these trade deals were especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised\nAt how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and\nHere's the other side of it is these things were outdated you know think about that North American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two as rent was side I was twenty five years ago and and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree\nUh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who or a a developing the energy sources that we were buying and now\nI'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada boat\nVery different positions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president will say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the uh\nWe appreciate a governor Rick Perry secretary Rick Perry into the great knowledge that he brings about what that job is and I think we've got a better understanding now your thoughts one eight hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero Joe ... dot coms there

I've never seen is like this Joey known in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taken enormous task right hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous as secure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage administration from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nIt's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican and raised in Wisconsin let's talk about the unaffordable Garrett would correct you supported the president as it all Republicans and has been all Americans because our paychecks are bigger and and do this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually helps people of the major\nAmount of people that were paying that find that taxes you an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys did a great job of lowering taxes role Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of pre existing ...\nMissions all the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you're a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it a of a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding in how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you like health care planning keep at ya families who have their previous reduced try five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside it'd be the two thousand Eighteen live a year\nOr they're they're pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule where President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right and they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if\nWe reinstate these things to three to sixty four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah and then in addition to that allow companies to offer me new ability okay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare and Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates in Wisconsin for example he health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her mama care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year you know they could get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks here you may be only pay a thousand so I don't know where the premiums Lana complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back\nAnd nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guaranteed remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if he could afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums cross because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to something you said a second ago when you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something that just really reiterate that former senator if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of covered for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do it through regulation right so the ... the protection terms or preexisting conditions you could always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't get the subsidies that can't afford they've been priced out of the hot and care exchanges\nWe're giving them an option to be asked to be able to afford\nHealth insurance for once okay ... this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of uh the short term when ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because we're on the one single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or were free enterprise base does that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if the if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away their protection preexisting condition which no Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nOr they think they can win the election but no I mean there are a long term goal obviously is Bernie ... Sanders your Medicare for all which just which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts a tour his single payer government run bureaucratic system\nThat will ration care will reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right by the way that's the only reason only costs only\nCosts thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs for like thirty eight trillion dollars every buddies individual income tax we have at least have to double business taxes at least double and they're still won't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening or watching to write down the number thirty two trillion they realize how much money but as a Senator Ron Johnson a one last question I run a rose reshaped the access of the time and You're welcome anytime my friend um when it comes to the mid term you just mentioned briefly\nI feel strongly that ... they would you guys but you might gain two or three I'm not I'm not predicting it's already should stay home everybody should go and vote certainly\nBut the houses are starting to look like it's up for grabs were this blue wave was being talked about for six months do you think that the moves by ... Feinstein and and uh and Cory bookers barbecues and all these people in that process\nYeah good for him a great\nFirst saw the a pay these protesters to go around and do all this stuff and we know

George Soros is not somebody who's a billionaire because he builds things he's a billionaire because of of the stock market I Believe um but no he he doesn't build the voting machines no\nOkay I heard that I was like wow if if if that was\nWell that would be ridiculous wouldn't have had ... ... you know\nThat would be that would be that anyway um yeah and why does not government here's something

straight down I'm the president calling the fed logo\nI guess I guess that's the issue I'm not even sure what that means but whenever it's a financial markets thing or financial question I always go to my friend Doug Adler he's the managing director and senior vice president of investments ruby James and associates or Doug I always appreciate it how's it going brother\nJohn great thank you so uh all the president has to say that the fed is logo\nAnd that we get eleven hundred points it due to the negative on the stock market people obviously you're freaking out some of them are dug you know me I think the stock market is a slot machine and the way some but I don't really worry about it my four oh one K. still looks great today um but people are freaking out about it can you point to one thing that made this happened ... conglomeration of things\nYeah I think it's a conglomeration of things Joe it what's always interesting about the market is\nThings that we know that are potential headwinds the market looks at it stares at it shrugs at a stretch it off and then suddenly it it it matters in which kinda manifested here as we know that the Federal Reserve is on this trajectory of raising interest rates\nSo what does that really at the end of the day designed to do cool off the economy so that brings into question next year twenty Nineteen what earnings look like\nTrade or China looks like a tough or a photo if you will and in this regard so that's problematic we've had a few companies are pre announce their earnings which don't didn't look necessarily great\nOil has gone up the you know that's I'm up to Seventy five now it's pulled back the last couple of days like everything toward Seventy but still it's a much higher than it was Eighteen months ago I had went on the economy should have some of these things that no those have all been there but suddenly that mattered and people that sell button\nDo you have a video ... managing director senior vice president over it originated associates given opinion as to why the fed would want to cool off the economy\n[noise] well they have this in a state inflation\nTarget of two percent going and then when you start to see a mention oil as an example there's other places we can point to that are that are showing some inflationary pressure which is part and parcel of course to a stronger economy in this economy as much stronger than it was when President Trump took office you're getting some of those pressures\nFed tries to stay in front of that because you you it's kind of like a you know the old porridge three little barest story they don't want it too hot or too cold yeah they want to just right and so they're trying to do that meaning a slow things down into that sweet spot where\nWe have reasonable growth but maybe that's three percent with reasonable inflation which they are they're aiming to be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable dug a ... I heard today somebody made mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump ... tank and they said oh let's see it didn't work all those the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational thing to politically people can make this happen\nI'm I that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um\nThink about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're kind of hurting yourself right if you're right except for the things go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay a gambler he's managing director of the vice president of a investments a ruby dreams and associates\nSo as we watch this you know Obama when he was an office and I talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or one that wasn't doing so great in in what he was doing great he said look I've read I Am I'm\nThis of course the left politically is saying well see the bubbles burst for sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles going to burst this can't continue like this\nDo you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again or are we seeing that maybe you do get too big words bridges\nYeah no I I think\nAre so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people think it's a bull market or their market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things\nBut really what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fits the regulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy that had been held back because of the consumer\nAnd then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that in consumer confidence I think last week we had an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet\nAnd in that regard I have to tell you this is really\nFor found two things first one is that\nService so that's just simply what comes in and income a into a household and then what goes out for obligations like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income and go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies\nAnd household net worth in this country such assets minus liabilities\nIt's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better sales and they've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat\nThan they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash\nYeah you bet that's easy appreciate Doug Adler he's again of the managing director\nAnd also the senior vice president of investments over imaging that associates or we started dug and half or more than Twenty years now when it comes to stuff like we saw happening with the stock market this past week agreed information is always one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... dot com stay right here [noise]\n...\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree to further your career and gave you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

need to have it when there was no son\nBut I you know where you're coming from I got to get out of your I Can't believe it or three hours flew by for Martin variety Joe package see you next week on the weekend\nThis is the weekend with a job at all [noise]\nAre you considering of safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it shapes are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet wouldn't it be great if there was a seat that had to look up a beautiful antiques so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the\nI don't know what Alissa Malone was talking about other than knowing that damn good job in commando with Arnold Schwarzenegger anyway\nShe's made that decision and the left media the legacy media in this country listening to what she has to say and it's like now giving her greens if he hears the odd thing\nAnd the whole thing is that what was the models involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or were you see me during the week on Newsmax when you turn it on\nAnd somebody has presented as an expert on something like I'll have an author on are all have a geologist on are all have a an actor\nOn it and I'll say this is an activity you might remember from this this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um the IRS the president's\nSon ... you'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person on some of the networks they'll say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the person is getting paid for your parents or an analyst\n\nGenerally speaking never as good as they do but they keep on presenting a listen a lotto and they never say why are we supposed to listen to her\nAnd address illicit mulatto says we need legal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on it and USA Today and I'm confused why are we doing a story on a list of a lotto\nI don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is\nFor some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights and equal opportunity in this country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment then\nChristie lousy for and what have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment\nAnd she's never really said why and again I don't really care white illicit mulatto thinks why she's not an expert\nI talked about this while I'm Talking about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes and people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or on the big screen for a long time and we stayed ourselves well\nWe were you for some reason project intelligence on\nThem a list of a lotto is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about none she has no clue\nShe has yet to make a point that makes sense\nYou have to the legacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think that she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers and general Americans I guess where the dumb people out there like a like me to buy into this far left wing garbage\nAll those are the lotto actually doesn't help at all not not doesn't up their side they think she does but she doesn't when was the lotto actually does is she hurt the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people like you and me\nSay well I'm definitely not going to vote that way lookout dumb that's the thing is that she's saying or liquor taking selfies or taking videos well sitting in a very serious hearing\nOr look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman 'cause every woman who's telling the truth well we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\n\nThey don't misunderstand me I'm actually from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously but you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe in once it's proven\n\nWell there you go you turn on the job or or your your read you know some of these current events websites\nThere's Alyssa mulatto and they never ever ever never say why we shouldn't believe are usually believable as mulatto because fill in the black just doesn't happen oh another trending

News the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio and praised Robert de leite period and their story and of course\nThat's the only during the stories you'll legacy media that large the reviewers of your readers and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert de leite on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in\nUlysses Grant kicked his ass\nYou talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass\nNow the media does that but they also know you don't know that you remember the president set up that way so if they say the president praised Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised rubbery layer because we drove yes but it's also a student of omission or reliable mission\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nAnd I got to a section of back and make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praised Robert he leaves the left and waved to the ... the bad guys that good for the best thing ever going to get on my plate neglect water yeah I guess you could say that if you're a ...\nA better thing to say might be what he really said\nUlysses Grant which so breaking good vetting kick this guy's

Spartacus grow because Booker\nYou had Dianne Feinstein sitting on a letter that she had that somebody alleged sexual impropriety\nYeah tunes just is outraged at all times as of now go this way you've got Richard Blumenthal who's a liar about who service claiming that he went to Vietnam when he never did\nYou've got Kamala Harris who brings you gonna run for president when I don't know that I've ever seen somebody more negative ... toward her political foes you got any Columbus chard who who thinks they're drinking beer at six am used cool you'd acted like it was bad that Brett Kavanaugh had a beer back in college so\nYou have the left that was interrupting that was rude that was outlandish that was out of line\nThat\nActually used as a pawn lousy forward or when she she has to be anonymous and not be out there in the public lied to her or her legal team did who by the way it was suggested by Feinstein lied to her about whether they will come out interviewer in California\nI mean the entire thing really showed little left is so they could say togetherness and we want to work across the aisle like we got this idiot Robert Francis O'Rourke running for Senate in Texas goes by that though for some reason he calls himself BDO\nHe's not as panic but all of his bumper stickers just say be Tio and all of a size just they'd be do\nYou want to believe that his name is Beto O'Rourke is Robert Francis do work what it is fourth generation Irish American nothing wrong with that just don't pretend you're somebody you're not\nHe's a guy that was in a punk rock band and word dress he was arrested for for DUI DWI in the late nineties the guy who reported him because there was an accident says he tried to flee the scene the police report says he tried to flee the scene\nPolitically he said things like I'm open to the idea of abolishing eyes\nHe said things like we basically stole half of Mexico from them which is patently untrue\nHe said things like he would definitely want to impeach the president of the United states should he get in he's an open borders guy he believes in open borders doesn't want a border wall\nYet when you see those commercials or here's commercials he's saying things like or diversity is or strength and we need to be together and work together for a better Texas\nWith that crap doesn't work anymore because people in America actually watch what you people did in the capital hearings it was disgusting and you went from probably winning the Senate till you're going to lose it now provided people actually go out and vote you need to go and vote\nAnd and a guaranteed when in the house doesn't look so likely anymore\nAnd the reason for that is people understand that right now under this president they've got lower taxes they've got more jobs uh we've had ever\nWe've got black and Hispanic unemployment through the roof women unemployment through the roof you've got manufacturing coming back our standing in the world is much better the terrorists are working because we're getting better deals with Mexico and with Canada and with you [noise] things are shifting\nThe left overplayed its hands\nAnd that's what we're seeing now to they have to pretend like the president doesn't doesn't like US Grant and love Robert The league which is just dumb when we come back you to hear from Sarah pale and former governor of Alaska right here\nOn the weekend don't touch that uh\nThis is the weekend with young [noise]\n\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it sinks or not very

tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I said you have an iPhone ... face time you and let's just settled this once and for all and and they're good as we got to get a thank you so much for reaching out by the way\nThat and that's it and then one other thing about that is yeah though I'm grabbing hot zone [laughter] by that time out of their vehicle and we're all in all these high to figure out how to say that\nAnd it worked out 'cause you press the but you took my face time and very ... well that's definitely her son Tina Fey that's her that's bad [laughter] I I Know you've got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding uh in in Washington DC I still to this day Sarah have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator\nAs a write in really so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican I Can't support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she said she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDo the people of Alaska except that excuse\nNo and go back even\nThere from her writing campaign after he lost the primary up here we never once heard Senator Frank were kept yeah after having served twenty two years in the U.S and he got the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on charming and I ran against him in to see that yeah that's a nice guy and that helped me than the man once you're in and you have special interests around the country right funding you\nYou know you have to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough\nTime to go but no rational reason that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again having the\nAs you point out she said he's good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know about calls like of course it is and whether either good madam\nYes I'm so no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as even suggested as you it outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska but for this country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you are you or your wife was about the nicer record of appeals at all over the ... of course the\nFormer vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain has the right of my mother's name until you got on the ticket and then I voted for you show and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her\nWere actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states\nThe Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's tied for the for animals everywhere we would be for for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Chuck amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment temperament for Alaska what does that make you think\nThat's exactly right and Joe I was so impressed because nobody else was talking about that they share um what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the nights circuits had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of\nSan Francisco right he talked about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaska because that court sixty million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest as the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so\nFor at least to be messing around with that uh that was that very very dangerous and the other thing is that the\nTrump President Trump saw the lights and is allowing animal are only in decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has",
