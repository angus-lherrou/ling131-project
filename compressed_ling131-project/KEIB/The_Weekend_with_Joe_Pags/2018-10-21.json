was on the top of your school down a bit you you'll see a section for parodies people been asked me to post my parity for a while now so I've done that is also a section for interviews a section for monologues and some some news stories of love inside\n\nIt turns out I started new story this morning that nobody one what was the mega millions or was it the power I don't know what the hell when it was nobody won the billion dollar jackpot now it's going to be\nOne point six billion come on to what the hell is going on one point six billion dollars if you imagine\nThat would be nuts\nThat would be absolutely nuts\nAre let's talk about Elizabeth Warren\nElizabeth Warren for decades has been claiming to be a Native American or as I like to say American indian why am I right when it comes to American indian because the individual tribes actually call themselves Indian tribes if it's okay for them it's okay for me\nShe's going to be an American Indian uh Cherokee in fact\nFor admissions to schools for applications to jobs she she has been listed as the first woman of color to be a professor at what Harvard or Yale or something like Harvard\nShe's been making this claim but there is no verification there's no proof she's never ever given any bit of evidence to suggest that she is in fact an American Indian so the president like he's apt to\nHas been name calling her because it sounds so stupid he calls are both gone is I think it's funny as hell people who are offended by it are very smart and don't have a sense of humor\nYou know like Rachel Dolezal who's white\nLike Sean King who's white\nYou know they're both pretend to be black Elizabeth Warren it seems has been pretending to be an American Indian\nWhat's your well because my cheekbones proves it no that doesn't prove anything in fact thanks though\nThe president's been calling around he said you a DNA test if you could prove to be that you're in India and I'll give it a million dollars or your favorite charity so she I guess it really does a DNA test\nGet to the test back\nAnd gives the results of the Boston Globe which is the far left wing left is the outlet\n\nAnd they write this big story that she proved that she's Native American they say there is a is there is a likelihood of up to one in thirty to chance or she's one thirty second Native American\nTo as little as one one thousand twenty four ths Native American\nAnd then the Boston Globe how to four hours later updated and corrected and say well the most you could possibly be as one sixty fourth Native American and beliefs as one one thousand forty fourth then when you look into\nThe actual test further it turns out there was no comparison of her DNA to DNA of American Indians\nIn fact the only comparing that was done that was even close was was South American native tribes\n\nAnd maybe she got South American blood or maybe South American native blood\nBut the probability is one one thousand twenty fourth is this not only didn't prove that she is a Native American disprove that she's not on average the average white American\nHas more Native American blood than than Elizabeth Warren\nThat's a fact Sunday making it up as a fact she's not an ... an American Indian she's gotten benefits for pretending that she was she just thought she was going to prove the president wrong when in fact she proved herself in ...\n\nShe is so not American indian that the Cherokee Nation has come out and asked her to just stop now\n\nOr when they did bad some left wing cable news outlet called the Cherokee Nation racist or a [noise]\nJared the Cherokee Nation is racist retelling a white woman to stop pretending to be part\nOf their nation that's the world in which we live guy let that sink in\nThat any of you go through this week thinking that lives with Warren proved to president wrong that anybody go through this week in the sink to yourselves while she really is Native American and by the way this is not a story any ... any of us didn't even care about\nExcept for the fact that it's an abuse through lying to get benefits that were meant for somebody else but nobody was talking about this nobody cared about this and Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas herself decided I'm going to go and start this whole thing up again\nAnd you ask yourself what she thinking nobody nobody was thinking about this or even a second

any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guard that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting good tracks and I mean I think if you look at South Florida and for the Miami Dade County\nHuge energy with Cuban Americans\nUm other Hispanics like Venezuelans and the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism they don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home countries are we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way and Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a\nPro Israel leaders in the country that had been in Congress\nElements hostile to Israel I mean he uh is endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is prominent in the bbs movement against Israel they say Israel's genocidal apartheid state I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great the huge one lump hosted\nGillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's\nA ton on indivisible capitals so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway and areas that may be a Republican wouldn't cause a Democrat\nEven though their party has drifted more and more anti Israel in Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't they find they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really align with the radical left a which\nIs really a very hostile to Israel now\nHe's in he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and it'd be government is also pro abortion you the guys are socialized launch\nMedicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy I don't know that day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic voters not monolithic I mean in Florida\nRains you want to end all of it right on board that was I think that they're successful\nAnd they're in a variety of different ways whether it's boiling hot weather expects they'll need whether we have a scholarship program for kids that are bullied in school so their parents and find a safe environment and you would cut the scholarship and force them back in the school where they are being bullied so he has very ideological about that even though these programs to work you would\nLiterally pull the rug out from underneath these families\nGet vouchers and scholarships like this obviously exponentially help lower income people wide left would be against it as not to be running I really appreciate your time and then how busy you are the Republican running for governor the great state of

individual tribes actually call themselves Indian tribes if it's okay for them it's okay for me\nShe's going to be an American Indian uh Cherokee in fact for admissions to schools for applications to jobs she she has been listed as the first woman of color to be a professor at what Harvard or Yale or something like Harvard\nShe's been making this plane but there is no verification there's no proof she's never ever given any bit of evidence to suggest that she is in fact an American Indian so the president like he's apt to\nHas been name calling her because it sounds so stupid he calls her Pocahontas I think it's funny as hell people who are offended by it aren't very smart and don't have a sense of humor\nYou know like Rachel Dolezal who's white like Sean King who's white\n\nYou know they're both pretended to be black Elizabeth Warren it seems has been pretending to be an American Indian\n\nWhat's your wild because my cheekbones proves it no that doesn't prove anything in fact thanks though\nSo president been calling around he said do a DNA test if you could prove to me that you're in India and I'll give it a million dollars or your favorite charity so she I guess secretly does a DNA test\nGets the test back\nAnd gives the results of the Boston Globe which is the far left wing left is the outlet\n\nAnd they write this big story that she proved that she's Native American they say there is a is there is a likelihood of up to one in thirty to chance or she's one thirty seconds Native American to as little\nAs one one thousand forty fourth ... Native American\nAnd then the Boston Globe and how to four hours later updated and corrected and say well\nThe most you could possibly be as one sixty fourth Native American and the least is one one thousand twenty fourth then when you look into the actual test further it turns out there was no comparison of her DNA to DNA of American Indians\nIn fact the only comparing that was done that was even close was was South American native tribes\nAnd maybe she got South American blood or maybe South American native blood\nBook the probability is one one thousand twenty fourth is this not only didn't prove that she is a Native American disprove that she's not on average the average white American\nHas more Native American blood than than Elizabeth Warren that's a fact Sunday making it up as a fact she's not an ... an American Indian she's gotten benefits for pretending that she was she just thought she was going to prove the president wrong when in fact she proved yourself or did he or\nShe is so not American indian but the Cherokee Nation has come out and asked her to just stop now\n\nOr when they did bad some left wing cable news outlet called the Cherokee Nation racist or a [noise]\nRight Jerry the Cherokee Nation is racist retelling a white woman to stop pretending to be part of their nation that's the world in which\nThey live guy looked at stake in it any time you\nGo through this week thinking but Elizabeth Warren proved to president wrong that anybody go through this week and I think to yourself while she really is Native American and by the way this is not a story anybody any of us didn't even care about\nExcept for the fact that it's an abuse\nThrough lying to get benefits that were meant for somebody else but nobody was talking about this nobody cared about this and Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas herself decided I'm going to go and start this whole thing up again\nAnd you ask yourself what she thinking nobody nobody was thinking about this or even a second you have for some reason\nWe had to have her thrust of this in our face again why decided I had to do a a a package parity about they call it Pocahontas I'll have their free will come back if you're not familiar with my ...

you know it's going to be Ted Cruz speaking on a Robert ... going themselves better go for some reason I'm not sure why but that's going to happen in Cuba Tony ... tonight in that race is probably not as close as the media's pretending but we really can't take it for granted right [noise]\nWhich he gave her a thing for granted people have to go out and they have to vote and then the the amount ya I hear people say to me well my guy guys Trump he's on the you know he's on the ballot or something I could go and vote and I go please you can't think that way you have to get out and vote idiots so critically important I mean\nDo as a country we're winning I mean everything about our country is winning right our economy is on fire at Fort Point two percent GDP Growth three point nine percent unemployment the lowest unemployment in the history of our nation we've got three percent wage growth which is the first time wages have gone up and sixteen years\nYou know we have um the largest military spending we have the largest tax cuts in history a manufacturing is coming back to our nation for one k.'s or through the roof of small businesses are paying Fifteen Percent less in taxes than they were\nA year ago which is just created such tip you know financial engine um I mean we are doing so incredible that's before you start talking about you know president for and what you need to be done in the opioid crisis he's taking on a Supreme Court justices and\nPrescription drugs no one wants to talk about that everything that he's done to lower the cost of prescription drugs you know something that is is is so keen on his mind you I'm you know and no one wants to talk about it but it it it's we're winning we're not getting ripped off by China anymore we're not getting ripped off by Mexico anymore you know we're finally negotiating good trade deals\nYou know the Chinese economy right now which you probably know better than anybody is down you know ... almost twenty five percent right right oh while America has the strongest economy that's ever hatch who's winning this thing right and and that's what he promised the American people he was going to do he promised the American people he was going to come in and he was going to win we're no longer get get used and abused as a country and but\nPeople have to get out there and they have to get out and vote\n... is our Eric Trump to sort of a president Donald Trump Jr absolutely right but I watch these races each very very suspect how the Democrats are running what they're saying use in races across the country usually moves all the advertising you're saying\nOh well what Trump gave a tax cut to his corporate buddies Ted Cruz give it a tax cut to his corporate friends the top one percent got the vast majority of the tax cut everybody else got nothing ... that's not true everybody who pays taxes got a tax cut and corporations will employers got tax cuts are all making more money some people get bonuses so\nHow do you think about the large when you see them wanting around about\nIt honestly they are ... some of the most dishonest people in the world I mean I I I've never seen anything like that I've never seen deception I've never seen the dishonesty of politics again this is this an worlds right where business people were not we don't we don't come out of a ... a political world these people are truly the most dishonest people in the entire world I mean\nYou look at the amount of small businesses in this country right or you know dozens and dozens of millions of small businesses right all across our\nOur nation they're getting they're paying Fifteen Percent or less in taxes you look at the regulations right I mean the way he flashed regulations it's promoting manufacturing coming back and people are getting hired that's why you have three point seven percent unemployment is ... you have the lowest\nHispanic unemployment the lowest African American unemployment in history\nThe lowest female unemployment in the history you know what I mean it's it's unbelievable it's all because of of of that right and you know negotiating trade deals where\n... you know this better name but you have a trade deal with with with China where\nIf you had the product to them they were charging twenty five percent twenty five fifty percent and terrorists right right where they can make the same product over there they can send it to you and we were in charge of anything so I mean who do you think's gonna win that battle I mean it's absolutely unbelievably well we we over tax companies we over regulate it you know companies as soon as that disappeared\nAre are that the economy of this country went crazy I mean it it it it's going through the roof are they the stock market this morning last time I looked at it was four hundred point I mean we're doing so well as a nation and we're winning but people have to get out there people have to vote you have to realize the lies and deception\nOf the other side and and they do you know why because every single time they open up there\nOne K. you know every time they open up their paycheck or when they go to pay their taxes and they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and they have jobs and they're not working two or three jobs and they're getting pay increases believe me people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that and then they terms but again people have to go out and vote\nFor Trump to sort of president Donald Trump ulcer jumping national interested about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people go ... or give us raises millions more people got ... a small businesses are adding\nEmployees instead of flushing the with Obamacare alone they slashed employees because there was a penalty if you had over fifty employees who your father made promises that he's sticking to it when it comes to the trade stuff\nCanada should no way we're going to do it then maybe the deal Mexico said no way we are to do it but maybe it'd be all do you use it in a way we're going to do with them they made a deal so your dad being punished and humbled by the media over the leverage that he knew he had when it came to the terrorists and stuff like that it all works and then they don't give them the praising the backbone how weird as\nWell how about health care costs I mean the same thing or a or a Obamacare wrote touting Obamacare Obamacare was the greatest disaster in the world has to be able to keep your doctor you're supposed to be able to keep your plane you're supposed to say twenty five hundred dollars healthcare costs\nYou know flew through the roof and that's all coming down you see all the new prescription drug um legislation that rises drastically reducing the price of prescription drugs you look at a right to try you look at so many of these different efforts and\nYou know that's right because you know the politicians had been stuck in a mindset um their entire lives and they don't care about actually governing they just want to keep themselves elected so their sales people that's not who he is I mean he's he's the one guy who's probably ever come into government who had the worst of life you know then then", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Weekend with
