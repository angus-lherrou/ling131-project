...\nShe's from them is to [laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWatch the new season of the\nTrying to be oh five\n[noise]\nSteve's\nWith us on the Clark Howard show Hi Steve how's it going hey ... thanks for taking the call sure Steve how can I serve you\nWell I I'm I'm fifty five years old and I really don't have a merry little we have a twenty year old son and we really don't have much of the savings to speak of no no I get by four or five months something like that but but I'm I'm concerned about retirement\nFirst of all that you have four or five months save for a rainy day give yourself some props that's good that's a healthy chunk that very few Americans actually have but you said something else that I Would be more distressed about so you have no money right now save for retirement\nBut there is a good time I was retired from the army for Twenty years from Twenty years of service well\nThank you for your service\nThank you and thank you for you like you do for everybody but listen [laughter] so I have that and that's a lifelong benefit for me where I work also has a retirement that will be eligible to collect and the other two and a half years so there will be income coming in\nWhen I Try to figure out what to do with it and most places I Do the research they don't know if it's just they're trying to get you to buy a product and you pay for that product you leave without it or [laughter] or some of the stuff they're just so confusing talk\nRight well I can make it so easy with you being fifty five and you're married single\nIs are married married and um how old is your wife ... years younger forty side\nRight so you were eligible to put aside up to sixty five hundred dollars into Iraq IRA each year\nThat I'm aware of it's just not a race in ... so you can't do that right now [noise]\nNot not that much I have a law but it's only it's nowhere near the contribution Lydia thousand dollars\nOkay that's fine is she also doing a thousand into a ...\nYou know certainly did not I like her to have her own okay\nWith her being forty five she's got more time to build up some money\nAnd that would be a priority how are you been able to come up with four to five months of rainy day fund so you're living on less than what you make you said you're twenty year old is your twenty year old going to college\nYes yes isn't that creating a financial drain on you\n... and so it's not too bad\nOkay All right so when you think about creating more breathing space in your life you have the good fortune because uh you giving Twenty years of your wife to your nation in the army you've got half pay for that for the rest of your life you'll have this pension from\nWhere you're working now and a couple more years you'll be eligible for that I mean you've got much more going in your favor of the most people do so that's why the one area that I Would work on is getting some raw money aside\nIn the years that you continue to decide to work and your wife continues to work because the rock money gives you so much flexibility and that it will not be taxed in the future\nAnd that's money I'd like for the two of you to rely on much later in life\nWhen you have much later retirement\nOkay well you gave them via a foundation that are in in ... about performing as well as far as the seven so\nWell maybe the choices you've chosen to put the Roth IRA money into\nThat 'cause I don't know what to do they're All right\nWell they're not going to make it really simple for you if you go to court dot com look at my investment guide and all lay out for you and I would only take you a couple of minutes to see the best choices for you to slap that money into\nAnd then over time you'll improve their performance you've got from that Roth IRA\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\nCourse that's a fix you know and I'm actually an and an Australian and I want to talk to a real about something\nVery important if you are ready to change that well we want to send you a few hundred college do you want to try to claim to Australia to learn how to be a mental change my\nAngst news it's the first day on a job for life Brett Kavanaugh yesterday confirmed by the Senate to become an associate Supreme Court justice\nHer her very good friend late somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was that the party has refuted the quite\nWell Christie lousy Ford testified in front of his panel the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody charged credible credible witness credible which is actually true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house would was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand has\nCorroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets built CDs and help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible\nIssues against this guy specifically and back to a point ability Asian that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what's he saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and didn't report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez\nWho says that at a party they were playing some game that\nI don't know you do to spin the bottle or it was the quarter is if they were playing something to where if you lost you had to drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk you're going to remember anything and then she's told Brett Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out and put it in near her face\nNow she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrat senators that are on that panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed\nSomething happened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six days you decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it\nTo which Kavanaugh said no there was anything like that what are you talking about the third one\nIs from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity is Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys part taking gang rape\nKavanaugh and judge she said would spike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods she knew this was going on\nBut she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happen between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party she wants ten of them in Nineteen eighty two she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nBut continued going to the parties for another full year and instead of calling the police\nWhich she said was just don't drink the punch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once NBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable\nThat ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story is changed a bunch of times that her history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lady that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Coons ... didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\n\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because the calls all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover what are your Fifteen he groped a girl he admits that\nHe's a senator somehow\nHe actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he made that\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of\nThese women has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resists lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a ... from outer space story she's given and received Ford\nOnly vase say something happened everybody else's named and the FBI spent five days\nSix days interviewing many more people and came to who didn't come to because you've offered up evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today going Twitter read your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls\nTheir dachshund people which means are putting out their information their their phone numbers their addresses\nThe say a violent crew of idiots that are still just completely disconnected from the rest of us middle is a mulatto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh they're still attempting they're still exempting these days are rapists serial rapist you're in a better rapist on the court it's it's a disgusting this way\nThey are trying their best to change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to being Saudi Arabia or something\nOr China come on man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do a show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen\nBetween now and then and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska who is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\nAnd she the reason she gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now with what\nCome home and so I Need your thoughts on this\nI I'm guaranteeing that you would have never been this engaged and the Supreme Court nominee every in your life I guarantee that is true\nBut lunch break it down and where are you on this even if you're on the left even a politically you're a Democrat or a liberal and somebody who generally speaking

I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of that can be I Will clear there's room if you've given

how anybody could think that Corning crying or at a man next and guilty\nAnd you got to live for the most out if that's true but that's why the court case and I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because that guy obviously has a lot of classic that very well rounded young man I call and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill\nBut ice eat he he's just a

Ford may have been assaulted but there is nothing compared that with Kavanaugh right if we let women like that come forward and get it kind of damage to announce reputation it's actually going to set back women have to find like decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked and it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term cry\nGreat bickering women have notoriously done at when they've been scorned or that or or many other things and the fact that we would want to do that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh\nWho surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country everybody came forward before now it's it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they're becoming more socialist\nI have a friend that was actually grew up in Argentina and came here and they came out that if she is\nA hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what it's truly like to live in a socialist country\nWe don't want to go that way that I just find it so hypocritical that here we're examining the person for a job in a court where he's supposed to be fair right that we get it that when he showed his emotions when he's being attacked and got like\n... you couldn't be more correct I mean he's facing something one of the most unfair things I've ever seen and then be charges no going be fair and and liberal hinted about this oh I'm Sorry I'm Sorry that happened to you and I'm Glad that you're a survivor and you're not looking at yourself as a victim no I I

Africa Deborah yeah of course we expect Obama to be able to fix anything you've never done anything\nIt turns out your data ... never\nDone anything you'd never had any experience there was no way and we should expect him to be able to fix anything economically guess what my father had done that he has built businesses or he didn't build that\nAnd so it shouldn't be a shock to people that were able to turn that around and now the Democrats want to reverse all of that they want to take everything into one eighty why because we have all time historic lows for blacks and unemployment\nFor Hispanics for women you know you want to reverse all that I mean if the Democrats the don't ask Donald Trump came out today in favor of oxygen\nAcross would be against it I mean that's their policies just hate\nBut we have to show up we have to stay on the fight to get people's they've done I Love your dad doing it's so great it's amazing it's\nYou know but I say well how we vote for who is your congressman they are voting for November what do you mean it was November right they're not in a way they want to vote and twenty twenty but they don't realize that it can all go away in twenty Eighteen they don't realize that Donald Trump is on the ticket in twenty Eighteen Donald Trump is on the ticket in six weeks so we got to get out\nWe got to mobilize if you like what's going on and\nMake sure to fight for it because the other side I don't know what they're motivated by I don't even know what their platform there's other than right you'll hate and outrage I mean you know what their outrage or they should be outraged about their platform and their failures over the last few decades but they are outraged about something else but they are turning up\nWe got to turn up I said all the time they're like no no no the same fake news media that said Donald Trump can't win and saying that he's going to lose now\nBelieve it I see the numbers you got to get out you gotta stay we can't just be fat ... being lazy and expect this stuff to continue he needs guy he need guys like Ted Cruz to any of the guys like ... to all of the congressional people in Texas that are up he need those guys helping him he can't do it by himself and I didn't giving the house to Nancy Pelosi\nSeries like\nSerious question I think about it I mean that would be a disaster for this\nCountry but then we got to turn around and we got to bring our friends\nIt's trending on average today the ... you blows you saying I'm going to be the speaker again it's Donald Trump junior and uh we we always appreciate the time a couple of things they didn't realize that your dad had the magic wand the whole time because it\nWas common sense and experience right you know this isn't a magic wand it's just you know you can't expect a community organizer to ... understand let alone it actually affects the way it real change when it comes to economic fiscal policy but right on fiscal but I think about it we we've discussed the economy I Know him what about foreign policy\nI look at the end you look at the Israeli embassy you look at what's going on in North Korea that took guts fine you know we don't just draw red line in Syria like Obama did when they cross it they slap you in the face where they tried doing that at least fifty seven Tomahawk missiles and ... and guess what the rest of the world was watching\nOkay we were not going to let people take advantage of something whether it's trade deals got NAFTA it can be renegotiated\nCan be done about congratulations Mexico and Canada now on board done like ... when when when you have a real leader\nI Wish that we had somebody in journalism in journalism was dead known him and he says is all the time to use it didn't go on one person steps up and says\nFormer President Obama just told me one thing you did that caused this to happen because how do you take credit for it if you look your dad when one eighty on everything Obama did ... how can Obama even for a second even think to themselves yeah I did that because we're\nNot we're not fighting a fair fight and that's why we all have to get out because we're fighting with one arm to arms to arms and a leg it feels like at times because the media walk like I said oh no this is the new normal one point ... percent within that doesn't have to be why why would the New York times back him up on that right because they needed to make him a success because they all believe in the asinine policies you see that\nI mean look at what's going on in fact of the bed or August putting up a challenge I mean Beto O'Rourke and run for mayor of New York city and be on the left side of a ticket\nAnd that's really the only way you know his his money is coming from all places other than Texas\nBecause you know those are our tax at the values that he espoused or you know the attacks on law enforcement one eliminate ice in the ... I mean ice only save nine hundred kids last year from you know a sex trafficking but they're terrible we should get rid of them I mean these people are insane and so we have to get out we have to stay motivated we have to bring our friends\nAnd you can't buy into the media stuff just look at what's going on in your business is look at what's going on your place of work looking your paycheck I mean you're winning with these policies these policies are moving the needle these policies are making a difference in America is getting respect again because we're not going to let little third world countries push us around and slap us around you\nKnow I gained ... and\nWe have to remember that because they can all go away in November\nAnd people need to realize that it's Donald Trump junior and I appreciate the access let's talk about Texas I as you know I'm based in San Antonio Fifteen stations in Texas we've got a hundred and twelve around the country but we focus now on Texas because there's been a real challenge Robert fruits as a war because what I call him he's somehow cold really appropriating but he's Hispanic but he's\nNot he's not at all Hispanic oh he'll pretend he is for the road but that's a democratic ... you can get away by the way if Ted Cruz did something like that now he happens to actually be Hispanic selling for granted something like that they would destroy ... absolutely you you got out of every day for better or it's\nNot a problem when he said something about what was the voluptuous breast or whatever that that's not a problem that only one day story of Ted Cruz did that it would be you know he shouldn't be disbarred he should be you know write it killed ... we're not fighting a fair fight and there's down ticket races that are dependent on this thing you know it's been great for tax as he's done he's fought for those values\nI look at the ... platform and like I said I mean this is in New York City mayoral candidate running for senator and Texas\nWell he's getting big support for Mellon so you know that's good it was like oh this is Donald Trump junior so you're in Texas you got Ted Cruz who I've known for ... wait longer than he's been a senator and he's always made promises that he's always done exactly what he said he would do was the thing is your dad and went out in the primaries but\nThere are very very similar politically in that they're not doing it politically they say I'm going to do this this this this and this and you're dead and had actually believe I should do those things I promise veto it was just given us you know a rainbows and puppy dogs it's weird well of\nCourse I listen I I really respect had him and it was it was a brutal primary and a little story I don't know if I'd actually even said this publicly but ... you know a couple of weeks after that and it was a brutal primary there was a big a a dinner in DC you know the usual you know this stuff [laughter]\nI I went uh and you know I was all my friends are from tax on there all the time hunting fishing or a has a lot of money to campaign down in Texas I'm sitting there at the Texas table and added a couple of friends tests at the table and we actually have a great dinner good conversation at the end of the\nDinner we say hey you know we're going back to the Trump Hotel right in the middle of DC on Pennsylvania Avenue we're gonna have a couple of drinks hanging out whatever you want to come along it came with us and that and the Trump Hotel we had a great time for three hours knows that took guts yeah but you know when I showed me beyond the guts is\nHe understood down from going to be president and he was going to help support policies that he believed in that we're going to be good for America and they were going to be good protects and he was able to put all of that aside and now they have a great relationship\nBecause they're doing what's right for their constituency and that was impressive to me that was a great a testament to his character and everything and I don't think I've ever told that story before but I think it's actually relevant\nHuh because you're doing what's right for your constituency and I don't see that everywhere else I mean they can look at where bagel rocks money is probably coming from writing\nThat probably doesn't represent the average guy in Texas right now that probably represents the average guy in the Hollywood studios so that's the difference and I don't want Texas to become California\nTexas I mean just look at the economic success if it had to look at all this debt but you want to become California give me a\n... and the people from California bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior\n... you have an opinion as to why anybody would listen to I'm going to take away your tax cut I'm going to I'm going to lower your paycheck we're going to open the border we're going to get rid of ISIS enforcing the border in every single week they are either catch agreements Thirteen or stopping\nSex trafficking why would anybody want nuclear blows you to be in charge against things are going so great right now why you know I Am but like I said\nWe're we're not in a fair fight you know the media will\nShow this was All right thing to do it but I'm all for taking care of other people once we take care of our own problems but we've got plenty of friends who are going to disastrous education system where what twenty eight and like the world after a long list of third world countries that you had half of spending and I have\nSpent the a small fraction of what we spend per capita right I mean we had we had that problem that we're working on fixing and they're making great progress with all of those things but like we

left she says the guy to be more judge was in the room was playing the music loudly and running interference for Kavanaugh mark judge says wasn't there no idea what she's talking about\nHer her very good friend Leighton somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else did she said was at that party has refuted the claim\nWell Christine Blasey Ford testify in front of this panel the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody sergeant credible credible witness credible which is actually true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was at the party and she's actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nRed cabin on the other hand\nHas everybody corroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets the help she needs some help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that to a point ability Asian that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and then a report that correctly\nThe second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez who says that at a party\nThere were playing some game\nThat I don't know you do to spin the bottle or it was a quarter as if they were playing something to where if you lost you had to drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk you've got to remember anything and then uh she's told wrecked Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out\nAnd put it at near her face\nMachine admittedly doesn't remember it and when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on that panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed something happened to me\nYou remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers that either\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I actually did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I\nDon't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it\nSo which Kavanaugh said no there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity is Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh and mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys partake in gang rape\nKavanaugh and judge she said what spike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happened between Nineteen eighty one night than any free she said but one day a one party joins ten of them and I ... to she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nWill continue to go into the parties where there's not a full year\nAnd instead of calling the police what she said was just don't drink the punch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once\nNBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable that ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences\nFrom the stories you originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times then her history comes out that she somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible but that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lay he that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Coons they've ... didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\n\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because you know it causes all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover what are your Fifteen he grow up to a girl he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he meant it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process it is in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent\nNothing any of these women has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resist lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a nutty from outer space story she's giving\nAnd Christine Ford\nOnly vase say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days six days interviewing many more people in Canada who didn't come to conclusions offered up evidence that there is no cooperation there is nothing more here\nYet the left is still today going Twitter\nRead your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls their dock sing people which means they're putting out their information their their phone number is their addresses the it's a a violent crew of idiots\nThat are still just completely disconnected from the rest of us I mean listen mulatto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh\nThey're still attempting they're still attempting these days are rapist serial rapist rapist on the court\nIt's it's a disgusting this way they are trying their best to change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to being Saudi Arabia or something or China\nCome on man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do the show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen between now and then and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska\nWho is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\nAnd she the reason she gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now ... what\nCome home and so I Need your thoughts on this I'm guaranteeing that you would have never been this engaged in a Supreme Court nominee ever in your life I guarantee that is true but let's break it down where are you on this\nAh they they they [noise] they they they have no\nMan Rooney off but [noise] they they they go to\nThe point was to ... ... ... ...\n... is a snake\nJust I don't like the guy we\nBoth\nThat big big fan [laughter]\nAh they lay

play play but I'm going to call it Kiss My ... am I\nGoing to do that but there you go a little some something for your thoughts on what's going down on what's happened so far and and again we do the show before or any vote would have been taken on Saturday So or to keep a close eye on that there are a couple of big monkey wrench that can be thrown in\nYou got this guy deems a believe a Montana\nWhose daughter is getting married today\nAnd it's the father of my daughters I'm with a [noise]\nHe's got to be at his daughter's wedding we that's got to happen\nSo he's a Republican and he's a yes vote for Kavanaugh will he be there when the vote happens\nIf they have fifty that's enough because they've got Mike Pence will be the tie breaker\nVery very interesting to me this is going to go down I Want to know where you are on this especially if you're on the left\nThe party on the left the Democrats went way too far here and actually shot themselves in the foot one eight hundred
