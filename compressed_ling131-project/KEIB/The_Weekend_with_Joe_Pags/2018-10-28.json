have to ask you a little bit\nUh only found your podcasts the last few months but the reason that the U.S all around and I noticed ... name recognized that goes I'm living in a New Orleans right now grew up watching the TV on the news all the time\nIn fact I got on the court says right ... ... all your debt ... recommendations for that stuff on the news so that was a relief on that I got here yet\nWell that's great to have you I Hope you enjoy our podcast\nAnd yeah it's been great so far you can learn a lot for sure\nThank you so just got married\nYes yes so we got married um and we're in the process of combining all of our finances all that kind of stuff and so I was just got older and\nUm we're both on kind of the same financial standing uh she's got a little bit of a school that I've got a little bit of credit card that we both like salmon a lot of money I'm so as far as combining finances go as water or you know there's a lot of best practices stuff like that because\nI was trying to read on the line of all there's all sorts of information all over the place\nWhere one of the factors I look at is how well both of you are\nOkay we're both in our mid thirties\nSo at that point when you get married after you've whipped independently for a long time don't rush combining everything\nUp because you each develop your own habits no matter how much it feels like you're on the same way when you're not going to be exactly on the same wavelength having been in a position where each of you had made all the decisions with everything involved with money\nAnd it can cause tension specially I'm In the first couple of years of marriage if you just all of a sudden combine everything\nSo a joke or it's different for people get married in their early twenties which not as many people do any more but getting married in your mid thirties which is more common now I'm white for you to have his money her money their money\nAnd by that I mean are having a joint household account\nThat both of you share and you have money that you eat to contribute to that\nEach month for rent slash mortgage other household expenses that you figure out and then you still have some money this years in an account and she has money that's hers and account ... and then we have credit cards\nI don't want you to combine those for a few years\nAll right so credit cards for a few years yeah that was actually going to\n\nBe my next question because as far as you know combining it to a joint that child that's a checking account or you don't like debit cards uh so I was reading you know there's a thing like with credit cards especially for a joint groceries things like that yeah I can make her like\nA cow holder or under my credit card or I'm a joint credit card something like that is there anything as far as that goes with the credit cards\nSo for spending that you're going to do that fits under the house account category like groceries you're gonna both feed 'em your cell phone bills have you combine a cell phone plan any of the stuff you're doing is a combined activity\nIn the great for you to have like a house account credit card that you pay in full each month that has some kind of rewards attached to it\nThat is your first joint credit account but for things like when she's going to buy clothes or you are she's going to get her hair done or whatever\nBecause you're each approaching it from years of making individual decisions those things are best at least for now left as individual charges on eat on individual cards rather than on one that's Troy\nOkay and so we can do like a joint credit card to realize that was the thing\nYeah you can be co owners of a cart\nOr she can add you for a house account she can add you as an authorized shoes or you can add her isn't authorize user to wonder if yours for the things that fit under house expenditures the concept is that you know over time you'll find how best you're spending merges as your wife\nOr goes on together by doing it all at once can cause tension that you didn't even know could be there and that's why the merging of finance there should be gradual instead of a media\nAnd congratulations to both of you you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n[noise] time for broadcasters to get the recognition they deserve for their role influencing pop culture and public opinion and you decide which broadcasts\nSunrise now just hours away in a city changed forever I'm Del Walters and they continue to mourn in Pittsburgh side of this nation's latest massacre forty six year old Robert Bauer is accused of opening fire inside a synagogue in that city [noise]\nYou know you've got so many unhinged people out there how do you protect yourself you got the alleged bomber under arrest as well the are ridiculous legacy disgusting media reporting but it's still Margot bomber the make America great again bomber which was disgusted\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case will you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him demographer bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter averaging rational baseball game there seemed to shoot her even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's about what we do\nThat's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news as as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's\nReporter to use a white guy with a beard\nAnd ... also was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American as first name is Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well and also a report that he's a talented Filipino\nThe media always the quick to say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman the guy who killed Trayvon Martin\nBecause Martin went back and was beating the hell out of 'em in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was this panic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have a Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely what your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected anything here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican and twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there weren't really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people we return addresses armies wouldn't fake addresses on the actual saying to\nOur area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about\nTrump did this I guess there was some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact that sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump\nYou if you were a make America great again hat you're a target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist in his ... and it's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for\nFor ... that's okay it's perfectly fine fake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example of for example to resemble that but the media again playing the victim in fact Jim Acosta from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment\nOr Hangst over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind this is a guy whose job is supposed to be the gold and report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost and and and his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living and make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be on the president you don't get to tell the president what mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrate violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who've committed violence in there on the right same thing should apply\nBut this is elected reporting and there's the desired by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is and it's just a crazy person that was an aged vats irresponsible\nThat's responsible or by the way that the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian\nIs family or a family friend or a lawyer somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he is in one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or American indian and the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic who knows what he is\nWhen we do know is he was some promoter for chipping nails\nAnd some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the the left is trying to glean from him and put it on Trump easier responsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw is not drug or observe and then tell us why from caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly got a bunch of interviews coming your way\nA bunch of interviews I might take some false flag called ...

County Arizona he is a right they're separated by an Indian reservation but right there on the border and deals with illegal immigration all the time I Want to know how he's preparing\nFor the caravan

appreciate it really had a good time with your at the fair get together in Washington DC\nGot some great knowledge I have to wear my cowboy boots next time I ... a shrimp um six wanna do F is standing next to you but ah it was a great time and really great knowledge I Love the way you guys there in your sheriff's department\nDo the job and especially you know watching you out there on live TV I saw out they're interacting with people in the community and I love the way that you take the job on a lot of people\nI've seen police officers you know guys like this to who walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't steak I've seen some who I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to who\nI'm going to interact with my neighbor here maybe somebody who goes to church with me or my my kids go to school together\nBut at the same time I I Can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that is these are my neighbors these are people that I'm gonna see at the store these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and uh I don't know what his wedding it's gone on in their life to put him to this point yeah so I tried to treat everybody with dignity and respect and we try to go in there now they escalated\nI don't have a problem escalated as well but I find that you can you can attract more slides and then you can then they're saying it\nAnd in watching you interact with again the sheriff mark lamb from ... county I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking to my ... unless they like get a shot somebody you walk up generally speaking very respectful and and you seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you figure percentage you can put on this where somebody will not get with the program not understand that you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a

for most police officers I mean for me it's probably about ten percent of those female\nOr get difficult to deal yeah ... that you know I'm I'm a believer in calmness and power if you walk out your calm and they can steal that they don't feel you're amped up it it really helps that situation go a lot smoother even if you have to rest\nIt ended up going to last but there's some people that just like you said from the word do they're not with the program and that you can tell that immediately\nWhat I've learned from watching your chair of mark limping out County Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like live PT and others um it is that when you walk up\nYou generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's going to get with the program you probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on 'em and but they're also minor enough to where you could still get them home tonight that you know it's kind of it's\nI didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\nJust relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently I think if you just stay calm was work through it um and it does give us the ability to use some of that discretion but you're right and if we wanted to

wherever you are on your scheduled plus all the one line except most transfer credits for information talks to pull off the air ... learned for yourself fly over here is ranked number one for\n... for most Lou hustle some bull\nRolling photos honed overrides a full of all of them\nWere former former NPR reporter for less than ... formal formal formal on the phone or former corporate who ... who are ... from\nOver two hundred and sixty years later with a little resource\nIngenuity and\nWe're not only capturing energy\nEnsuring Americans have the energy they need whenever\nHe was doing this or ... the ... bomber they're calling you know for our good bomber speak\nTo people do not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these college they didn't call him a seemed a shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here\nThere is and I'll tell you a jot play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes and in fact the coach after batting practice or after I took some a swing state do you want to take some ground or is the second I looked out\nThe was take them now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shootings so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is while they blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric\nThey often hum are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton urged instability or Maxine Waters Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder a media analyst we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well the violence happens they made it happen\nI mean we we'd like to see them tamped down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy who did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so it is the the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the raging a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing it contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished in fact there's thirty five forty years later the media looks back at ... lovingly and and they do love and back then\nUm and and they're treating from horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point but thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times you know probably is in my view you know has two legacies tax\nCuts that are ... the economy for decades in the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half\nReally and then you put on top of that this amazing a record in the courts of a constitutional judges from the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt it's a remarkable success you have to\nYou again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair\nIt'd be the success that we're seeing was fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your Joe I Want to come on but I only been up to minutes and you're like you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow\nAnd all of us every American to pay taxes got a break every American who pays taxes has a bigger paychecks many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses where they got raises companies are are no manufacturing stuff here again or promising to start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success as\nWe've got we've got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations are going to drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing in tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas or manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and and and in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest economic recovery um since World War two right and he never had a year never had a year he broke three percent um uh for the entire year here because of an more good news again this morning in the third quarter that three and a half percent growth beat\n[noise]\n\n\nYou can we can with Joe packs thing stopping by\nMoscow long lost to get to eat is one eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty\nOne eight hundred five zero one seven zero eight zero many more um interviews to go to your phone calls as well we will have 'em\nAs we continue we're going to have John ... he's going to be the bottom of next dollar use the executive director of the regular Institute out in California great conversation comparing the media and how he treated Reagan and how he acted back to them with how\nThe current president President Trump is acting toward the media also ... will be off the top of the hour yup the former communications director for president Donald Trump\nWhat the hell out of the marriage only on the job for a living days will have that for you to write none of the phone lines delivers the old welcome to outline one each Lisa in California I Lisa\nHi how are you I'm living the dream which I Would have\nBeen calling um I actually ties into what the last caller was talking about um went shooting how how would you get that\nChurches typically forget I mean there are a whole nother story in the movie theaters and other other churches that difficulty how would you get to the church hey action sort out the bad guys\nFrom the gun versus the good guys with a gun and I'll tell you I'm a good guy with a guy you\nKnow and I certainly when I go to church I go to church and I take it that personal responsibility to right not only\nProtect myself but anybody that might that might come under attack against the bad guy with a guy you know\nWhen I first and foremost would allow concealed carry at churches I bet that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to uh I live in Texas do allow to in many places but at the same time they're also signs up for him to be preparing my gun I think at that point if you're going to\nIf you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target\nThe simple answer is that if you're not going to allow me to carry my garden\nAnd you should but if you're not gonna allow me to you better have protection there for my family\nAnd for me and that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun you want to to get a license for him you've gone through the classes for a and then there's no protection\nWhatsoever I mean we can look at the Aurora shooting you're going to Colorado that guy quite literally avoided six other leaders in the area because they all allow people to carry guns\nBut once we interviewed tack did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their\nTwelve people died so we are\nI think that you have to work in conjunction synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and I don't know if they do or don't I'm guessing they don't or they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance annex it\nThis way anybody getting ... getting out or anybody get a good mood to be an emergency are going to be other started to get out but anybody getting into that facility and they want to cause harm\nYou're gonna you're gonna identify them before they could pull the trigger one time\nHere and then I got that they can do it in the land they can certainly do it at a church\nWill they will they do it in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House so so the people that we paid to be our legislators are representatives or a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House\nYou can't get anywhere near that place until you have a full body scan so why do they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there were church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah as much as I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play in like obviously that the economic I'm a full body scan for example or even a metal detector and you know those are those are those items that are not just that that\nHave an accent that the people around them and in a church probably qualified people that are going to be there any way to get that kind of\nThing but then there's training involved then right I don't know I just\nDon't like it like I said as much as I don't disagree with you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost and market thing that it's not a realistic idea at\nMuch well I I I think that you allow concealed carry them almost at a time if you allow concealed carry by guys like you and me\nCongregation members if people know and that we know have have gone through the steps to get the license to be able to carry like that also you you just have a bus system where you have to be ... to ... to ... I've been back ended up itself could save some watch without a doubt each one eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... dot com and that he's ... combat\n\nGet this book is called the blue color president it's Anthony Scaramucci I'm a former communications director for the White House right\nWell yeah what was I was there for eleven days it was a\n... amazing days come on let's\nAppreciate I had a great time you know unfortunately I made a mistake and got blown out of my seat could uh you know there were political reasons for that as well which I described in the book but a you know what I was there to help the president on their loyalty to the president you know I did some a\nMedia this morning I was on CNN and trust and what I said that I called the president a liar not what I said the president is telling it like that and he's covering the truth is doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger your eyeball\n'cause he knows it's going to distract you cause you to be like a school monitor all rocker\nAnd and it works every single time when you go to a CNN or MSNBC when you're walking into stores and look I've been working CNN headline news on fifty over there I mean that when you walk in and still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize\nThat there is a definitive spin when you walk into that ... did you know you really get you know some some lip poked for now and it's hard to get you to spend the president a certain way\nPretty much on message I think they were really hitting me that or this morning and I'm trying to figure that could kill me based but that's fine people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president to say listen I get fired Fifteen months ago I was a loyal to the president's Joe you would have figured it out by now or I wrote a very ... very funny book\nAbout my relationship with him you know what do you like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father\nWhen they were like young you know his father's actually now deceased but I'm going to get back\nInto the seventies when his dad was working with him and mentoring him what they were life so this was a real fun book to write a rocket called yesterday uh she said that she she went through the book she read it a hundred percent for Bush said it was great each couldn't wait to show it to her Father Greg\nOr one of his best friend said the same thing you know 'cause I listen I I I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president to or three times when I was given my press briefing last you bad I'm a New Yorker I have to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nOught to it and again I'm from New York I'm In the ... of course short for packed we will so why are we we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like everybody I got to tell you my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president of these people are fighters who come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of America and certainly not the elite media in America\nThey don't understand that do they know they don't understand it they sent it there's micro aggressions Reagan president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotional feeling you could ever politically incorrect things to say\nUh and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that there are offended by right\nThere is a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place now like a strategy Aaron David Miller does a ... and\nThat's how people from queens or from my area or your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm sure that's my personality\nI agree it's embodies during most of the blue collar President Bill blue collar president it's out now go and get this great book\nLet's go back to the media stuff because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he said he's running for president were you surprised I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually not surprised they turned on him when he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty bad guys were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great\nRelationship with the media will do and what happened I said there was a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies and you know we we let the band declare war on the media and that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right he purposely looked for a cost them out and tries to tell me your fake news\n... editor in and across the eats it up he does it every time you make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but it but again I thought that it was really really good pick up a time I understand what happened but\nUm when you were in that job did you think that the media wouldn't work with you did you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House when the price\nI thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought that would be some kind of a peace offering me general what a ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day Joe ... era as the press secretary I did the first press conference\nAnd I saw on Saturday that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team and also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the ... plant\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter I was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets contacts\nHe was being very of secrets than flattering to me any begging me effectively to do a profile story within reason trail me around and I was like well I'm not Steve Bannon and I'm not their self promoting myself when I\nUse of expletives which I obviously regret she loved that guy changed ran over to CNN with it but he waited he wrote this ridiculously\nIn you know exaggerated article and then you really should take you know four or five days later people look at them like the taste sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right\nWhy would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we wanted ambushing them to see if we can get him out of the White House or a you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping to present so what's\nThe other parts of it will give you went back and fight but\nIf you went and checked out the pod cast after your name I thought it was a good pick because I felt like you were a guy who wasn't ... who's going to be very direct you're going to be very straight with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with a retired minister Asian here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that you got suckered in a little bit there and it doesn't feel good I've had that happen to me\nBut you got you got pulled in because you're actually trust somebody something that guys like you wouldn't you want to do we want to trust people\nHe ate Joe I made a mistake it's dishes by Bruce place down the area I didn't anticipate how bad it was a I told my Wall Street present Thirty years on Wall street now let me tell you something the worst person on Wall street is literally the best person down there so while\nI Know how bad it is down there in it is what it is and so for me\nUh a lot of my book is also about that ... that you know where I got up dusted myself off I was sort of like mayhem and they all say commercial coming through the car crash right and I told my kids watch what I Do with this thing now because we never want to do is be on your back for too long or you don't\nWant the left wing media to build a shame box for you to stand inside of\nYou want to be you and so I'm I'm fully expressing myself a lot of fun writing this book I Hope that people who go out and buy the book at ten percent as much fun reading it as a kid writing it was really an enjoyable thing for me to do a lot of research that\nIt's a Anthony Scaramucci the new book the blue collar president I urge you to go get to go get five copies give it to your friends and family it's the color president a last question and I think people are dying to know the Senate but what's the relationship with the president\nYou know I Would say is good I mean we we we don't talk or a super ... is the part of the United states I don't feel the need to bother him yeah\nI had a very good conversation with them last July regarding trade I put in an op ed in the ass gee we had a rigorous intellectual discussion about that um and I get along I mean we I think we see the world are pretty similarly I'm and I'm not sure damn I Hope he's not a short me for what happened\nHe seems to be a that kind of guy I right at the end of the book guys like ... date bossy myself a day was environment where he was fired I was fired I call as S P else were fired but loyal [laughter]\nSo you know I I feel very good about the president or is that the one of the toughest jobs in the world you I certainly didn't want to make it harder for them I was there to try and make it easier and by the way I'm here to how do I do a lot of media surrogacy for the campaign a and I'm writing a lot of a bench warmer state by state\nEverybody going to get this book the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci you know something that you said earlier in the interview really stuck out and it's a you know here just Fifteen months later and you're still world with the president ... who was out for Fifteen seconds and have a new book\nSo uh I I really think that that you showed your loyalty and the fact that the fact that you could look at me look at my listeners and look at look at my viewers and say I made a mistake\nI should have thought the ... better and I really think I could have been an effective guy I agree with everything that you just said I think that's also\nGot on the mistakes you make in life you're going to tell my kids that be accountable I'm not blaming anybody I'm not playing the victim and one last thing which I think you would appreciate growing up the way you did and I hope he's listening to it you know whining and sports of politics Joe\nFacts are going to win five and I'm Sorry to tell you like the machine\nWhile I Am a big Yankee fan obviously but but if it's gonna be the ... anybody should be the red Sox because they'd be the edges\nOf just like you know like a machine that were like last night so to me no whining and spores and ... I got slammed around uh but I'm having a great in\nThe whole life I'm very blessed to be able to put my life back together with my wife uh and like I said like I said do about it yesterday everything's good I think your dad maybe as famous as you in Milan yet to sleep with them or be his daughter so I thought that I actually thought it was great\nThere you're do is I ... I was really a great time hanging out with the guy is just really he's he's uh about as honest as you're going to find somebody to interview about exactly what went on\nAnd about exactly how it went down\nAdmits the mistake and and like I said at the time I really felt that he could have been ineffective guy for President Trump but if you let his guard down why nobody was George W just admitted to it it is the Joe ... it is the weekend with Joe ... phone calls on that one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... dot com we're coming right back there [noise]\nWho's ... who's right and there were bombed there were some nut job it was one guy I'm a threatening the I don't like CNN because that's what I\nI don't watch the you know hold on angel stop nobody could hear it when I'm speaking nobody can hear you I'm gonna give you a chance I promise I mean the ... I I have to stop you the allegation that you just made was that I Want somebody to bomb CNN I Would never want that I used to go into the fifth street in a building and I used to be on headline news when Glenn Beck\nWas off so I don't hate CNN I just know that they're not delivering the news and an unbiased fashion go ahead\nOkay I I think they have a port and green hair and I think we've gotten that Trump for example that are not reporting what they do it right\nNow he didn't do that he didn't do that now that you you bought hook line and sinker they you bought hook line and sinker you bought you bought a hook line and sinker Angela\nStop you can't be hurt if I'm speaking it doesn't work that way I did like I don't have to let you answer because you make something up when you bought into what the name of your told you call back with\nCall back of your for your journalism degree next on Iran twenty eight awards for excellence in journalism from the AP from Michigan association of broadcasters that he or gay pie I Know the job CNN is purposely misleading people like you because it's affected it worked on you that's the problem\nSo look don't make this garbage up you want to believe CNN you wanna like what's going on it's because you agree with them don't pretend it's an unbiased outlet it's not I can give you a list of the fake news stories that CNN itself has put out there John Hi Bush when we come back and read it [laughter]\n[noise]\nMessaging ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech\nCompanies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

radio show or you can both be heard at the same time so do you make an allegation and but I Want to comment on it you got stopped for a second and then I'll let you can to you but the fact that she wouldn't have stopped talking she felt that she would whether she kept talking unfortunately for you I have\nThe microphone and I have control of of what's being hurt at any given time I know I have a decision to make\nEither both of us speak of the same time and my listeners and viewers don't get to your either of us or turn you down or just hang up on you know just keep talking um it's not going to be both ways now I Am a fair guy that I'll stop and let you continue but if you're gonna make allegation of drug allegation about how great CNN is\nAnd not let me respond it's not going to work when it comes to ... because there are there are a few big lives out there about Donald Trump he was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true in fact the Muslim ban or the the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One percent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's a ... it was one of my focus just not true\nOf the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people are very funny people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a very loud debate debate an emotional debate there are very are there are bad people on both sides they are very fine people on both sides\nThat it'd be we're talking about isn't whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues to Confederate a war heroes or soldiers or leaders\nThat's what it was about cause they're tearing down people are tearing down monuments because they feel like they can and they really can't it's against the law first of all and secondly it's a debate that we should have are they are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yep\nOr they're good people on the side of terror tear it down sure or they're bad people in that side absolutely so he's ... he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and and the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on you actually believe\nThat he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not\nHe's never said anything that would that would suggest that he is and this whole thing about how we mocked disabled a reporter is also ally\nYes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms were I guess I don't know what to do with the ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this\nAnd when he talks as have stay like that that that he doesn't have the full mobility of his hands in his in his forms as as most people do\nAnd the president went through I guess the guy wrote something bad or report something bad about or negative about the president and he said oh look at me any sort of did his hands in a similar fashion and made you know spoken to in a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't mimicking them that way\nAnd be very good just go to you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are are ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even considering running when he was on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo is he ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was depression was the clear boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when the reporter didn't do a report until two veteran sixteen or maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not\nSometimes he acts like a dark that way the president and he does have that way and he speaks that way do look at me with Donald Trump um stupid or something you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're going to do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant would hand motion to do and if you ever done that before and we're not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker\nWhat's a fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong and don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you you may in fact of being a little more than I Do but you failed in any debate when you walk into thinking you're superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level of anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in his business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what by politics work so bring it next time I get Angela but you better bring it better than that\nAll right let me get to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the or the Reagan facility the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate you are you\nI'm just great to be with\nYou have really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind just got my attention or it appears to be a plaintiff some sorting some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nWell we're right here at the Reagan Library that's a A R at fourteen and Jen is one of the famous jets that little off the carrier that a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots are when they came after our fleet at one point in Nineteen eighty six\nI I Do remember that and I also remember that the President Reagan said watch this and went back in and launched an attack on on Gadhafi himself and that really got him under control doesn't it\nThey started understanding what they had the front of them read they saw reading and for the success was but it really did take you know you know darn near or one or two more precedence east before the press really started a small farmer\nIt's kind of amazing or a last question I appreciate the time John I'm ... how does how does Trump either a repair this relationship where do you see them going forward just doing exactly which weren't so far because I mean frankly the media might say that he's a failure he's horrible news or something to do that\nAnd if something is but the bottom line is these crowds of a hundred thousand people are signing up to go see him in Texas and elsewhere ... what do you see them doing going forward\nAnd if we use the word repair I don't think that's conceivably possible because I don't think this is something that's necessarily now within his control\nI don't think even if I Want to walk up tomorrow morning and want to you know kissing Hollington press is not going to happen uh and and that's because it's interesting it it's not too tough to imagine that Trump has an individual made a decision\nTo go to war with the media but\nBut now that the media has made the decision to go to war with Trump yeah that's a very different thing I don't think the media and I I think they've kind of a\nNa you know they they've kinda bought Trump's line now and and now they're they're they're in an enemy campaigned against him no matter what I don't think there's a truce that's on the horizon they

schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree to further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case what you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him the smog bomber is not only get appropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter had the rational baseball game the Sanders shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do that's also not being honest and it's not reporting the\nNews as as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been a reporter to use a white guy with a beard\nAlso was reported that the bombing suspect was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American his first name as Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well I've also reports that he's a talented Filipino\nThe media always the quick to say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman\nThe guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of them in in self defense he shot and killed them they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was this panic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have out of Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely what your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected anything here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican in twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media sends out a\nBunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there were really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people replace return addresses on these fake addresses on the actual saying to our area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about\nTrump did this and I guess there was some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact it sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump\nYou have you were a make America great again hat your target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist than Islamophobia Xena fall but that's OK the media school with that you're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for for food and\nThat's okay it's perfectly fine fake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example every example example of that\nBut the media again playing the victim in fact general concept from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or ... over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give better not\nThis is a guy whose job is supposed to be to go there to report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a costume and and his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living and make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be on the president you\nGet to tell the president what mentioned he has to make for you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are those who perpetrate violence on the left should be arrested and\nOr or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who've committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply\nWith the selective reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is if it's just a crazy person that was unhinged that's irresponsible\nThat they're responsible or by the way the the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian\nIs family or a family friend or a lawyer or somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or an American Indian and the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic who knows what he is\nWhen we do know is he was some promoter for shipping nails\nAnd some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the leftist trying to glean from him and put it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid and the media needs to learn it's job again\nAnd extensive criminal record we know that he was a Democrat until twenty sixteen when he allegedly switched to Republican\nWe know that he's a wannabe bodybuilder we know that his family says that he's delusional we nobody has presented himself as an American Indian I'm a seminal to be exact\nIn South Florida what we know these things we know that also his\nAllegedly who's the lawyer for his family I couldn't verify that was his lawyer but I'm was on NPR or something saying that he was actually Phillies actually Filipino and Italian who knows\nI don't know what I Do know\nNews the FBI says these were real
