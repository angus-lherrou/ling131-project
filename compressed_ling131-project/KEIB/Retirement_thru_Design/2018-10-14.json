online training academy share it with us all kinds of stories here's one one recent graduate had to say\nI bar tended at a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas off and maybe eight years and I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and\nShe abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different of needed my time I needed my life another student says\n... al ... and ... something that I had always wanted to death and so if I die for that had a chemical or ... that changed my life\nLearn more visitors on line that free O T a class on Tom that's free OT a class dot com\n[noise] you're listening to how we're trading radio [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just sitting in his Larry Jacobs director of a stretch of elements having structure it on training academy really shed some light on making more income\nIn the market we've been talking a lot um a lot about generating more income whether its primary income\nWhether it's supplemental income whether it's passive income or whether it's active income and one of the things\nI always like to boil down in my classes Larry's everybody starts with ... with active income and then eventually moves into passive income even if you take the wealthiest people in the world right at one point they were working right above it was out there they call it a buffet and he was going door to door buying stocks for people back in the day even as a kid\nI think I remember reading how he sold bubblegum like on the on the beach at like his family vacations right as active\nIncome and right now that the common piece of active income that we all that we all generally have is is our job right we'd go out we have that job actively\nWorking to generate income well now we take a little bit about the money and we pay our bills and we put some food in our in our stomach and all of this fun stuff right that we should have a little bit of money left over that goes into our retirement account now that retirement account really ends up being that first wave\nOf passive income money making money right money at work rather than men at work and one of the things that we need to make sure that we're doing is that that account is always heading in the right direction you we've talked a lot on air and author about the situation that the markets in\nWe recognize different selling opportunities we've identified different selling opportunities we've talked about looking at the down markets as a\nOpportunity rather than a bad thing you know and and here we sit again all time highs breaking highs and we start to have that sell off again and a lot of people are going all man is this the next shoe\nBecause what we've been waiting for for the last few years is everybody's been saying just wait for these interest rates to start climbing and we'll come back to the normal come back to the mean we've started to see the interest rates climb we've even seen some contraction and job growth right it's it's slowing so we're starting to see some of these telltale signs but in the end\nThat does not need to affect anybody's income and that's one of my favorite things about the markets is down markets still generate income\nYeah we teach people to trade like banks I mean ultimately we teach them the core strategy is our\nPatented simple step by step strategy and really it's easy to learn it's perfect for beginners it's perfect for any account side which grade is you get to learn to trade in live markets and most importantly you can start immediately\nSo when you go in and start taking the opportunity to learn a new skill and become more confident\nThink about it if all this brought you to one really great profitable trade wouldn't it be worth it\nYeah absolutely and it does take really as far as you look at risk versus reward you come out to the half the class maybe do get just one good trade over the next month just from this step by step process pays for itself pretty quick especially when you look at the half day classes only about three hours long so really you're investing three hours of your time and\nOne of the things that we always break down on the shows is we'll talk about you know a lot of people will spend three hours of their time golfing they'll spend three hours their time of the movie\nEspecially if it's avatar right that was at least three hours long right to spend three hours of their time on social media we spend three hours of our time\nWatching TV right so I always say you know we're using all twenty four hours a day but are we using them to their full story maximizing the potential because when we talk about our money in the markets\nWe want to maximize our money's potential we want to maximize our time potential as well so maybe we spend a little less time on social media and we spend a little more time learning how to generate a better income inside of the financial markets one of the ways where we can help somebody really do that Larry\nWe got a second tickets here but we do a little give away let's do it All right well right now he's got to have to

Jacobs and director of instructor development and top instructor it online trading ketamine really shed some light on retirement accounts were talking about protecting the retirement accounts were talking about how to generate more income inside of the retirement accounts\nAnd really how important it is to have still multiple streams of income even as we roll into those retirement years you know building out the stability whether we're twenty or where there were two hundred and Twenty years old right building out that stability building out that consistent income\nSo that we don't have any question marks in our life and one of the things that we really didn't touch on that last segment may maybe we'll get onto next week\nIs really how many question marks happen the older we get you know it's it's called a surprise because it's something we didn't plan on and there's all all sorts of things that happen\nA as we start going down that talked track in fact it's always interesting to me how when we talk to people who have not retired you put them in the same room you put in the people who have not retired and the people who have retired and he asked the people who have not retired\nDo you think you can live off less and they all say yes and then you talk to the people who have retired\nAnd you say can you live off less and they go no\nBecause there's so many unexpected that come up as we get a little more miles on our body I mean we could just go down the healthcare path but this but there's just so many things that come up that multiple streams income end up being very very critical you know ends up being very very important to create that nice stability now whether you're just turning and maybe your first time was or maybe you've been with us for the whole show\nGet excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners are not quite sure they have enough time to really even add investing into their life you know after all there's\nOnly twenty four hours in the day and right now we're using all of them and and the thing I Would like to bring up is Hollywood right there's all sorts of movies that have trading in it there's also some T. T. V. shows that have investing in it\nAnd they show it let's all encompassing kind of lifestyle when in reality it's not that the average trader doesn't have Eighteen computer monitors the average traded didn't just take their hypertension medication errors traders not sweating profusely right now in fact when you're doing this appropriately your proactively investing\nYour lifestyle can have a lot of freedom in it and that's that's one of the things I I like you to expand on 'cause you you talked with more students than probably anybody I Know you know what are some of the life changing things your seeing\nAnd what are the some of the things people are doing to really get that freedom\nFirst is taking a step I mean a lot of people are poor for the simple reason\nPoor stands for passing over opportunities repeatedly\nThe people who tend to do better in life do so by taking action when opportunities arise they're not in their comfort zone they're not fearing all the time what they're doing is they're learning a skill that will allow them not only to help themselves maybe their kids their grandkids and again\nWe'll find with our students Ryan is they are not from a certain way or education or background\nThere simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier the number one mistake than most people make with their money if they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits\nAnd number two they never do go back to do the education because they've blown up the money that they had\nSo what does good students do I talk to them all the time number one they realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because it's\nLong as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named ... in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nNot\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where my data goes making an online purchase were simply access your email could put your private information at risk you're being tracked\nOn line by social media sites marketing companies and your mobile Internet provider\nThat's why I just wanted to take back my privacy by using express VPN expressed VPN has easy to use apps that runs seamlessly in the background of my computer phone and tablet German gone to express VPN protection only takes one click\nExpress BBN secures and none of my eyes as your Internet browsing by encrypting data and hiding your public IP address protecting yourself with express BBN costs less than seven dollars a month\nProtect your online activity today and find out how you can get three months free and express BBN dot com slash book that's express VPN dot com slash book for three months free with a one year package visit express BBN dot com slash book to learn more\nEver forgotten the password or misplaced your cell phone or ...\nThat's what every day feels like for a person living with Alzheimer's old timers Los Angeles provides free services to families and caregivers and greater LA and the Inland Empire until there's a cue or we provide to care [noise]\nCall go online for help to donate more to get involved\nAt four four H.

I mean he\nIs everyone wants to be like and that is because he is the brains of the operation out here that's for sure\nBut I got Larry out here and Larry first question for you is how that you're doing doing great Ryan how you doing I'm doing wonderful excited to be out here with you all doing the show this week we have a lot of fun doing the show and talking to your financial family out there across the airwaves\nAnd one of the things we always focus the vast majority of our time and I would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get you know in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to\nHow to generate more income inside of the financial markets and one of the things we always stress and I I Know will spend a lot of time on it here today is how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down and whether the mark joins sideways and and that's really the the key is because there's three directions and and it's individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold kind of bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that we hold it for a long time and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth uh it's just what the heck of a whole lot more\nNow one of the things I Want to get some of your feedback on it's always a fun show starter\nIs really the consistency side of things because really if we're going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be direction ally dependent than what I mean by that is we can't\nOnly profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach at stake last year it on a train economy one of my favorite things it's really work with the class and get them to be down markets as opportunities not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as a so bad because people are losing money and well that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith the right knowledge and what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major\nCrashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the source of the world the policies of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nAnd it really just boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but what are some of the things you guys are working on what the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team are are are laying out there right now or to help people become more consistent than less directional independent inside of the market\nWill this last week has been beautiful I mean everything we've been talking about on the show together I'm Talking about this for weeks now waiting for the opportunity to see the markets correct and come back down and as a result what happens starting off at the end of last week and to this week as we got everybody's wish that\nThe market started coming down it comes down three times faster than it goes up and a lot of our students were taught that once that market goes down you could actually make money shorting the market it's called shorting where you're actually selling in the market\nAs opposed to most people who buy the markets so a lot of our students shift from that fear of oh my God the market's going down I don't know what to do more to lose money to well I can actually learn how to make money if the markets go down it's simply doing what the banks do\nBig banks are always out there to make money whether the markets go up down sideways and with a lot of our students seeing we tell them is do you see how this would benefit you by learning how to trade in more than just one direction\nYeah and when you look at even the difference between let's even just a a mutual fund versus a hedge fund and the mutual fund is generally just investing into a long position and it was called a mutual fund 'cause it's this joint effort between us and the financial institution but it only makes money as the markets are going up but it doesn't mean that strategy is never useful and that that product has never useful that's not what I'm trying to get out here\nBut as it's going down those ones are generally losing money and we're paying fees to be involved or to be invested into that fund you look at the hedge fund type strategy and and that word Hedges pretty critical because hedge\nIs meaning that there is a position that propped on the way up and there's also protection or even a position that could profit on the way down and so when you start looking at things as far as the market's going there's multiple directions in the market the up down into sideways it's critical to make sure that we have strategies kind of liked that hedged mentality that can make money if the markets are going up\nAnd our sideways and you're one of the things I talked about one of my classes a long time ago was or wasn't managing if you went to work then they said hey you know what\nWe really like you you're a great candidate we think you'd be a great fit for the company\nBut you can expect to be laid off one third of the time one third of the time we're not going to pay a\nYou know and that's really what happens if we're only trading any bullish direction anytime the markets are going sideways our retirement account or income account is laid off\nAnytime the markets are going down a retirement account or income account as is laid off not to not even bring up the fact that maybe it's it's deteriorating a little bit especially as the markets are going down but what are the things that we can do is always okay with you Larry when things that we can do is we have a big stack of tickets right here we are just kicking the shop we've got a bunch of tickets we can give away and we can help a few people out there get started\nBecoming more consistent in the market by but you would a quick little give away for these passes that our to our half the class is what he said let's do it\nAll right well right now I've got a half day class come up in your area they have to classes while you'll see exactly what it takes to be more consistent in the market making money generate more income as the market's going up down or sideways now they have\nTo classes about three hours long and if you would have set up passes\nTo these half day classes that is going to be your investment just a little bit of time spent three hours of your time any financial education scenario rather than maybe on social media or watching TV sounds like a good investment\nTo me well just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of these passes or one of the happy classes to get your bones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over included with your passes it's going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhanced senior retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is a much much more the professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now\n... what he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track ... consistency conversation I should say you know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the market going down\nWhat are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bones but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go well you can always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people pulling out of the markets\nAre the Martin he's going somewhere either go into gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here is it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before we teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock short bond short gold shark\nThey're able to start learning how to trade and the beauty of learning what shorting is\nIs that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing last February Goldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply Shorty in the market now that day imagine that we did a little piece of I'm not going to be greedy you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make your money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou got to go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you know it's a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagine you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd not only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom and doing the things we want to do rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more of these passes what he say let's do it right now you have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income\nWhether that's supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks doesn't matter it's all about generating more income\nAnd we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time and have their classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that great or ward and that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these have to classes to get your phone's writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes are professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional and Saturday it makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we needed a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow as we're kind of going down his income conversation we were talking about supplemental income in primary income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income which kind of that that that that starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income past somebody's looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start people\nOff with well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and ... says you don't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great\nSo many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly vote on it all in fact most of our instructors will tell our students is I Would it's not about quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love because if we can put our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams right but I Want to do that\nBecause we're looking for multiple income streams but at the same time you've heard this expression our whole lives right don't work hard work smart well that's not how people who make a lot of money I think\nThey're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right\nAnd what working right means is they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things that are students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could've worked just one more day that would have been excellent now\nThey're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love and to think about it just because you're going out and setting a second job yeah you may get a couple of extra zeroes at the end of your income\nBut if you don't have to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management\nHe's going to have more zeroes on the end of your expenses\nA lot of people are miserable they're out there thinking they've got to work even harder and harder with teaching students how to work right and that's simply means coming in and understanding how you could create more freedom for yourself and hopefully people are listening right now and see how could they could create more freedom\nYeah and it's all about generating that skill you know you're you're talking about people coming in and looking to make money rather gates and just you know I Want to I Want to take this dollar and turn it into a million dollars by went by tomorrow like okay it's not very realistic right\nBut so one of the things we always like to bring that up is it's all about generate generating skill building the skill and the money comes after you have to have the skill first just like in any other\nBusiness in any other walk of life the skill is something that we that we really have to have first and I always tell everybody if you're looking for a a get rich quick program\nThen half the class probably isn't for you and really the financial markets probably aren't for you and that's that's just being real because we have to generate the skills to be able to generate the income and building any skill usually isn't an overnight process it's usually something that takes a little time\nAlso said to add to that 'cause I Love where you're going you also can't be someone who doesn't take action\nYou don't want to get to stay stuck where you are right now and you're not coach ... those are definitely things that are not going to work out for you but if you're somebody who really is interested in learning a new skill that can ultimately benefit you in the long run and this is an excellent opportunity for you\nYeah if you're looking to build some skills in the financial market and learn how to generate a greater source of income\nAnd you're willing to put in the time as Larry says well then I think you may be our next caller to win a set of these passes but first I've got to get Larry submission to give away let's do it All right we're right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to really generate that extra source of income really built out those multiple streams of income side of the financial markets\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of these passes to half day class each phones ready if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kitten this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on

seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nWere up against that once again Larry but what do you have a force next short\nTerm income let's talk about what might\nBe more detrimental to our listeners are fun what happening in the markets right now it's awfully long time to time you got some retirement account conversation coming up after the break [noise]\n\nIf you can invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for life

a class dot com\n[noise] this is how retraining radio back to the show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs and director of a structure ... online trading really shed some light on multiple streams of in a little bit about half of income we talked a little bit about active income\nAnd then specifically spend a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the ... the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus dreams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later in so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right I mean how many times have you talked to a a a surgeon and they said oh well you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill just doesn't really work that way we got to have the skill first\nOtherwise that operating table can be dangerous spot to be laying now unfortunately it ends up being that same\n... that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously you work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just because it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money in our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing it bearish market which was what you were just touching on right as we are going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating and it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talk to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know we're number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting out before we took a break and so I'd love to give you kind of give you the floor
