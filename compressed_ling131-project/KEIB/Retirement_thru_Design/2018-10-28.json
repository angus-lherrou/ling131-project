you have you have bags in bags loads of ... of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place that are now in another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck think about this time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we're going to start seeing all these Jim commercials again right\n'cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was this is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf and coastal Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they trade the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before or after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet

far you having to get a second call that passive or supplemental income and we'll talk about that right when we get back to Larry\nSeason [noise]\nAt online training academy our mission is to offer exceptional financial education so you could live the life you've always wanted maybe it's just having that peace of mind so you don't have to worry so much about the bills or even just having the luxury of not working so hard\nTo see what's more time to spend with the family graduates of online training academy share it with us all kinds of stories here's one one racing graduate had to say\nI bartender that a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas often maybe eight years I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different of needed time I needed my life\nAnother student says ... you can find happening at a career and training that's something that I had always wanted to death and ... as I said that but at a chemical or start that changed my life\nLearn more visitors on line that free O T H ... that's free OT a class dot com\n[noise] you're listening to power trading radio [noise]\nWe'll come back and you're just shooting you you must Larry Jacobs director of a structure development and top instructor it on a train\nEconomy really shed some light on consistent returns in the market\nIt's one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency in the market so many times I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time\nTalking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we were talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on\nWho are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this was a primary source of income that's a great question right you know what I\nFind with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over ... fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I'd mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to kick a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two off shore living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable to trade when it'll be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nAbsolutely just kind of chicken things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you tie it back to the half day class you know they have to classes or three hours long and see if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by X percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with ... with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish and so I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month\nAnd that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why ... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know ... it's a it's a nice details process of well you know what my kids do this and or I Want to do that and there's all these goals\nWant to start accomplishing and part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build up a supplemental income it can be through a passive channel it could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be dropped as it could be their stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say Larry is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire and he has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about it like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we got a little bit of savings to buy as little time but it ended up being that kind of\nThat that that downward spiral or even just stuck in a rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nYour building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be ah not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability at it you\nKnow as a sitting here thinking what you were saying and you you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing which really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh when I say this but with the frog\nIf you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box\nAnd you've covered the box ... a couple of times the fraud hits the top lid and even if it just that little way they still can't jumping the higher the where the lid was we don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least ... definition of self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagined you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd not only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom and doing the things we want to do rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more these passes what are you say let's do it right now you have to a class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income whether that's supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks doesn't matter it's all about generating more income\nAnd we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half day classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that great ward and that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these have take classes to get your phone's writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over included with your passages are professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top constructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your time or a strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional inside of kit makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learn how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else just telling you what you need\nWhen you're talking about the kind of the cycles of the markets go through the big ups in the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at him how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that yet about fifty percent drop Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing\nAnd so if we come to here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about a year we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value as a fifty thousand that happened in one year\nAnd that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires they one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again\nIt's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now to flu bad at three hundred percent increase in two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow is get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the cost of ... exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on

end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat might Dennis off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and then nothing against that\nPoor people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs and so think about it you were at an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you're investing your money and all of a sudden the market corrects will that correction is going to impact\nThe first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into so now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that ... percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further when the market goes down that dramatically like it didn't two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the forfeiture as in housing dividend cuts dividend cuts so all these things\nHave a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and that is a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started into this multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the half day classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to have to class going up in your area\nThat day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing make sure we have income for

the wealthiest people in the world right at one point they were working right above it was out there they called a buffet he he was going door to door buying stocks for people back in the day even as

that we all generally have is is our job right we'd go out we have that job actively\nWorking to generate income well now we take a little bit about the money we pay our bills and we put some food in
