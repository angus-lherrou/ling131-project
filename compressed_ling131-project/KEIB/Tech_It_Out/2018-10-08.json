I mean we don't we're a\nGood sized oil producer in the state really at ten percent of the oil that comes it comes out of the ground in the United states or off the shores of California yeah ... no I mean I look at it like that it's the oil extraction tax\nHas saved the Gyp blitz of Louisiana in Oklahoma and Texas we should certainly do what they did\nThey did the right thing we should do the right thing to the oil is beneath our feet weather British shale oil or oil is our oil it doesn't in inherently belong to the oil companies because they're drilling and I mean you know that doesn't that doesn't make any difference\nI'm an oil extraction tax would go a long way to help and California's infrastructure in ... in reality if we'd had one going back thirty or forty years it'd be no gas tax so\nIt wouldn't exist why don't we have it I mean we're going to blow because the oil companies have a tremendous amount of\nPower in Sacramento still and they don't want it [noise]\nAh yes the the legislature is heavily democratic but up until recently a governor moon beem was a friend of the ... you know this is only changed in the last year or so so the fact of the matter is is that\nThere hasn't been a lot of impetus for it I think that\nThe gas tax is just plain a bad idea for a lot of reasons not the least of which is the gasoline consumption itself\nLet's say that the gas tax would raise enough money to fix the infrastructure twelve years at the level of gas consumption that exist now gasoline consumption is going to keep dropping\nYou know every time a vehicle on the road that burns gasoline is replaced by a hybrid or electric car that's less gas and that happens now every thirty seconds in California at least\nSo a gas tax not efficient way of raising money in the first place\nOr I think that it would make more sense to either make it a general revenue issue via bonds or as a very very small tax increase but the gas taxes is just crap it's silliness\nYou know uh I have noticed this though are the gas tax went into effect quite a while before this recent upsurge an uptick in gas prices 'cause gas prices go going way up all over the United states\nA barrel of crude is what it eighty six dollars a barrel highest it's been four years um we're starting to see the repercussions\nOf an ill conceived energy policy worldwide indeed in dealing with Iran and dealing with Saudi Arabia and\nAs a result gasoline prices are going up here they are going up they're going through the roof and some states\nI'm In a lot of people in California you're confused when they see the price of gas went up from three thirty nine to three fifty nine a gallon in a month\nThere like a ... that's the gas tax it's like no it's not the gas tax gas taxes gasoline is going up everywhere for one also to winter approaches I realize that we have short memories of the state but winter in California means the price of gas goes up because the winter blend has to be introduced\nThat's why the sky is a pretty color of blue as opposed to tobacco brown which it was when I first moved here Thirty years ago All right\nYou see if you want good stuff every so often you got to pay for it I Know that it's a drag that all good stuff should be free\nAnd everybody should get a pony and everybody should have unicorns and rainbows everywhere they go but that's not the way life works sometimes if you want stuff you just gonna have to pry that wallet open with the crow bar and go get it\nNow when we return for the regular show not the regular shows a cartoon show was rigged being more to guide our regular show with seven PM\nNobody understood that reference I'll never make that one again a Johnny venom is going to join us hopefully moment to while the will join us as well we've got an awful lot to talk about including the brilliance of the corona beer companies began you were a little surprised when you saw that\nYou [noise] uh surprised how much they made off yeah the story\nYou're definitely gonna wanna stay tuned for\nPatriot Katie I'd be stay tuned we're coming back with good stuff is one\nCompany yeah you could've okay now what would you be kind enough to explain exactly what I meant by that cryptic encrypted an elusive remark\n... go ahead but corona beer company investing candidates companies right [laughter] they invested it and I think it was Kennedy growth Corp right and I wanted to say one other one but I I'm ... I'm having a write in FARC\nOkay constellation canopy were the ones that they invested right\nYeah well ... yeah yeah ... ... is the name of the the\nAssume that they own corona in the first place yeah hey I Want\nTo say full disclosure to nobody gets in trouble here yeah I have an investment as well I have a chi Wu pharmaceuticals ... baguette\nThat I had this like nobody's getting in trouble here All right um but yeah no I'm not surprised look at that ... look at the Chicago mercantile exchange has been wanting to do what candidates are at hand futures contract going now ten or twelve years OK okay but they're ...\nThey're debating resistance from the SPCA and of course the justice and by the time because they seem to churches\nBecause they can't figure out a way to reconcile the business of money with a business that is theoretically illegal right okay\nBut this is a long time coming ... if you look at for example when there was legalized in Colorado\nAnybody could see it is in fact even before they go to another like\nWell okay or I Believe Spain as well so now this is smart but there's going to be other companies there's going to be more white becomes completely legalize [laughter]\nI mean look at it it came through in prohibition was moving to how many beer company emerged how many liquor companies emerge you're going to see the same thing and in fact when the guy as you\nYeah I mean look at signings look at sea grooms you know in the wake of prohibition they went crazy as it became one of the biggest companies in the world\nAnd then you have often said on your show it's only a matter of time until you know one of the big tobacco companies\nYeah gets involved no I mean you'll much money on the table\nIt was rumored over forty years ago than R. J. Reynolds was buying gigantic tracts of land in Kentucky in North Carolina specifically for this so\nNo it it's a brilliant move and to not be surprised I Know there's a lot of private equity money going into these things right if you look at the start even look at how re right at the big Canadian one you look at for example again cannot be growth you look at crow knows group\nAnd of course the one I saw it but I'm not promoting anything here again I don't want to get in trouble\nRight ah I Am I I have a question for you we stocks\nAre creating an awful lot more growth and energy and excitement in the market to people thought they were going to in two thousand and Eighteen is was speculated that part of the run up in the market in the last month I had to do with\nThe boom in the growth of marijuana business no pun intended is this true\nWell no they're not that might have isn't that isn't really bug me say that yeah it will okay\nIt it it can it the right to look like the only thing is to your listeners\nI Will be very very careful right after these really make that much money okay or money at all\nSo it's ... it's ... dot com mission it's way\n... early stage dot com and I'm going to tell you right now yeah it is highly lower tier\nHow was it so volatile on\nWhat was it this way the current implied\nVolatility that forty one percent ... meaning just ... just to give you an idea or actually I'm Sorry fifty one point nine the one percent is for for what I owe it or if you want to look at the one that the constellation pets\nTo imply volatility eighty eight percent or Ninety percent yeah basically means that within\nOne year that stock will move Ninety percent up or Ninety percent that\nWow okay so that's a real yeah\nThat that's a ... I like I said I heard your listeners to wait for a really down day yeah and I get I I cannot legally tell you which ones to buy I don't want to get your show in trouble\nNo and also that's not your job you know like nut\nI Would wait till nice things balance out there and look into in fact you know what there's going to be an ATF that's an exchange traded fund that's like a mutual\nRight that's going to be made that this is going to be made up of weed stock\nRight state I Would recommend you go in in that versus the individual companies that way you're more said it it's a it's a relatively safe for so one of these blows up to like the things move like any stock pharmaceutical companies right now\nShould have been as anybody who's ever invested penny stuck pharmaceutical companies you know I don't invest too much money but on the other hand they make a discovery of some kind of like yeah I mean the other makes you taller or grow hair on your head all of a sudden the stocks that was trading\nSixty cents a share is trading at fourteen bucks this year yeah I Know that's true that's the gist of our armed suitable stocks it's crap shoot you know\nBut for your IRA or four O. one K. yeah please please take a second look only if you can get an ATF you'll get you'll be able to get the whole industry versus you know wheeling and dealing on one company\nOkay now how does this affect us in California where the early ... yeah\nOkay first started because the market these type of action\nYou are going to the more money coming into investing in the industry as a whole ... the individual stores I read an article that a company called Mad Men yeah which is a chain is getting a lot of private equity they may be going public I don't want to say for certain that I read something like that\nYou could see more of that coming before you could see a lot of member of this in the same way as you would a tobacco is stuck in that there's a there's a chain\nA value chain from Grover right distributor right package are you from the whole thing and just look at what goes into that\nRight now to be getting the money and then eventually they're going to need money the for example a canopy growth but one that the constellation has a share and they're going to be issuing a bond offering\nOh okay why why did I usually get\nTheir issues because they need to grow because because they need the money to expand operations they're reaching a point but here's the interesting thing is this is convertible debt\nTo shares it\nYeah and they can get a ... and and that's a smart thing because they're at that stage and a lot of these companies are going to start doing that because they're at that stage where they're going to reach critical mass\nAnd the and then they're going to want to go to equities anyway because that's where all the grow right okay let me do something before we go to break John a written rhetorical question\nIt is clear that it is Starbucks evidence to Twenty years ago and this is the week businesses now tastes in America force various items are changing correct yes okay\nIf you had to look into a crystal ball was coffee and coffee shops\nSomebody who won style for one thing for one\nBecause you're asking for spread around risk goes down where you spread it around money's like Moore's gross things would have spread around let's say one policy\nDoes have Ramsey show\nAnd three on the patriots am eleven fifty\n[noise]\nFox News ...
