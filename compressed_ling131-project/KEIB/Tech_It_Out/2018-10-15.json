V. A. N. D. A. L. S. and we'll keep this program going don't call program tonight I'm going to want to doing something really dark you don't want to know about and next week we should be back with they live\nA call in show but you know comedy show anyway so what do you care but go to the Facebook page barely legal radio with us go on tape and that's where the action is it's where you can get\nQuestions answered from in a good mood and right now in this segment I'm going to\nThis is where I go to my Facebook page and I see what it posted there during the week and I see what you're saying about it let me go or the stuff there because during the week on the post and stuff Janet let's talk about this this weekend\nAnd sometimes you postings there so the first thing I posted there not the first thing but one of the things I'm what does that do have posted\nYeah it's just kind of related is a writer in Hollywood it goes back to my first segment the writer in Hollywood writer of the Stephen Colbert show a tweeted a thing that said whatever whatever happens I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life\nWow\nNow she quickly deleted it I have never treated anything that I didn't regret\nThat's why don't tweet anything except for pictures of my dog I still regret those\nBecause then people say oh look at you you don't have cancer San Chambliss ... tweeting pictures of dunk the fed it [noise]\nSo I don't do it and do anything on Twitter but\nAnyways I advise you don't do anything on Twitter ... does it mean Instagram it's more intimate put a picture watch them cooks lambs have you seen ... if you're not following coup clams on Instagram you're not living\nTo tell you that right now so this lady's name aerial demands I'm not going to make the obvious joke about a dumb ass name but aerial demands whatever happens I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh was life she's a comedy writer\nSo good for comedy writers I'd say in in Hollywood you're not going to suffer that much like some new ones going to say how dare you have that opinion you know cause in Hollywood seems to be okay to ruin that guy's life to them it seems to be worth it I'm not going to\nGet into that right now but\nIt's a little vial a tile she had to take it down if I'm if I'm the executive producer of the cold air show I'd say hey look you know I hate that guy too but um you know don't make my job harder than it already is\nWho I I don't know I don't get it [noise] so anyway and then there again this is why I say there's always another side ruined that guy's life for what I mean\nHe [laughter] if you think he represents something that harms women\nI accept that\nAnd I just try to tell celebrities an artist that are going to come and listen to the show you gotta understand there are other people that think that guy is the best thing that ever happened to women and for women and they just believe that maybe because he's a Catholic um maybe because he's\nYou know if they look over his decisions and\nHe's\nVoted the same way as the other guy they wanted to put in your Ninety three Ninety seven percent of the time but whenever there's women that that that can make a deeply held\nArgument based on a deeply held belief that that guy is the best thing ever happened to him and he might disagree with those people and that's that's that's awesome you disagree with them and you have your ears and they have there's\nBut when you when you're trying to sell soap on TV you know your ... your Philly for commercials\nAnd you're going to go after somebody like that that's that's a little vicious I don't I don't get it but I I if you want to hate him hate him great so anyway so what would the comments on that one yeah of course there were a lot of comments like that when\nA Cassie corral said she didn't hear he was sworn in oh I guess maybe you I'm\nA ... I guess she didn't run his life and this other one says remember when you read this is Rebecca Brunner remember when you read to kill a mocking bird and you learned that a woman's accusations should be investigated before man is lynched\nAnd then there was meant to reply to that one and most of the people were with her some people said the guy's a jerk anyway\nSome people that the guy from my uh kindergarten class of gotten a big fight political fight with somebody\nAh which you know we could go talk about posting political things on Facebook I was just kind of being lazy I posted that because it was it was too easy\nOkay so what else they post [noise] and if you want to get in there on it tell him tell me what you think about this this lady are you where do you think that's OK in in Hollywood that help you get a job as a ... maybe you have stories about\nYou know political things had happened to you at work again I don't talk about politics at work I just you know I talk about my dog and a beautiful wife maybe some sports has meant even the sports I like it or not popular [noise]\nOkay what's the other one that I posted oh I'm Fleetwood Mac so Fleetwood Mac Lindsay Buckingham quits\nOr gets kicked out ... show like correct myself really buckling Buckingham wants his share of tour proceeds after getting kicked out of the ban saying he's ready and willing to perform with the band\nThis is complicated ... their longtime lead guitarist Lindsay Buckingham suing his former bandmates after being kicked off the group's new tour\nIn January bucking them was told by the manager that the rest of the ban would be touring without him and he says none of his bandmates would return his calls to explain why\nSo that's kind of like getting kicked out of the band he's suing Mick Fleetwood Stevie Nicks Christine ... and John McAfee and\nCarrot top for some reason I don't understand that but\nHe things should be paid the tour revenues they're going to go into are they still got to pay him because he's ready and willing to towards the band and his lawyer is insisted that this has been a partnership ... they've always act has acted as if it's a partnership why the insisting on that because they have a new partnership agreement have known corporations have no ...\nI what I Am aware of and again I don't know the whole lack but from my understanding is basically how we're streaming roar as previous Thanks This is the fourth such thing\nRight and it also it it it goes into the ability of legacy artist to get paid as well so good because that's part of the bill is it's a double bill it is the music modernization act is part of the bill as is the classic\nAct the classic second and what does the classics that ensures that artists are properly compensated for pre Nineteen Seventy two master recordings and the allocation for producers act provides for increased compensation for producers and engineers\nWhen their music is used on online and satellite radio\nIn other words zero going where the musicians are going to be able to get paid again\nSome watch okay because musicians is very difficult to collect royalties autism from streams on Pandora spot to find other platforms YouTube\nIt's become a significant copyright law this was unanimously supported by Republicans and Democrats both this law has been in the works for over six years okay\nUh it accomplishes three tasks John streamline the process by which music rights holders can be paid for their songs being played on streaming services and includes producers and payment for songs when they're played on satellite and online it allows for payment of royalties for songs written before Nineteen Seventy two which didn't exist before\nOkay here's the deal the industry has been grappling with this issue of black box streaming\nGenerally sponsored by being the worst okay in other words it was really really difficult for recording artist to get paid the question is this\nDo you believe with your understanding of economics and understanding that screaming being what it is it's still free for the most part do you believe that this will revitalize the recording industry and its capital Los Angeles California\nI think the economics of music has changed permanently I think believe it or not because the technology right has lowered the barrier entry for anybody to be basically they're recording company\nHas their own music company where of that yes right and I think\nThat has an impact on the cause of making the music right and a distribution so I I think the way you do it it's gone\nOh yeah it's a revitalization if you mean you know having more record companies only on a smaller individual level compared to before\nI here's the thing with the idea of record companies though is the idea that you would have a monolith as it takes artist work stamps it onto something portable but tangible and then sell it in stores\nTo people that's over with you don't do that anymore I mean the fact\nIs as you well know because you're a Facebook friend of mine as well as being my guest on Sunday nights and being my friend friend is that those of us who still record music\nPushing this heavily on social media it is our way of being heard the fact is is that now me and I've I've been playing in in in bands now for ... in in bars for forty two years\nIt is now a lot easier for me to be heard\nToday all over the world than it ever was I mean I hear from people in Japan I hear from people in Taiwan I hear from people in Europe oh a a like a new song say\nYes or no and not only that they have the ability and the consumer to how to make\nTheir own quote unquote album lights where they\nCould back toward refund with a new one added in with a like a play with or album whatever you want to call with your previous war right so I got it it goes to show you that the barriers event tree I like the not you don't\nGet regarding Los Angeles again I don't see a return or the rise of New Hampshire recording company I guess that that's out the window and they think by the way or the fall of other industries as well\nYou really I think I just did this I just simply a precursor to a lot of other things and yes it's true some artists are going to make a little more money than they did but ultimately it's still going out on the road selling ticket was\nWhat you would streaming yeah you are seen with other technology than the ... the treatment of that industry you could say a movie and TV right I think you're starting to see that\nYou're seeing this manufacturing [noise] I mean we talked in that path on your show how eventually you know you could have mom hop companies that make their own stuff and it's nice\nAnd you know salad on potential market places like Amazon or what have you back once you're sitting with music if you really look at it\nA longer arc right returning back the way music was a hundred and fifty years ago right\nBefore the hundred before the phonograph record existed before at the right under the photograph sure you know it's not stamped on to anything it's not a ... because ultimately remember what a lot of people don't recognize about recording industries that they weren't selling music\nThey were selling some things that music was stamped upon yes when you were selling an album you weren't just selling the tens of songs on it you were selling some things that you were selling the vehicle alright ... not the destination so that doesn't exist anymore you know ... and\nAnd I don't see and the idea is it okay Liz this is going to revitalize the recording industry\nIt really isn't we're at the point now Jon Morse theoretically you could set up a recording studio in your house if you had a good sounding room and a couple of Mike since ... you can record an album on an iPhone wants to know you could you know do it on\nYour laptop all you need about three or four hundred dollars worth of the house who thing yeah good might yeah at the software\nAnd in fact you know it goes back to forgive me for quite a year but this goes back to when Mozart was making music I'm going that far back as civically that point because it was at that point that you saw it you will spread the word about just like you're doing ...\nWell here's here's the thing\nAnd they will they will create their own content yeah okay gotcha now you can play\n[laughter] family's figuring out the ins and outs of the show Southern California live with Wendell Johnny want to hang on through the break you know where you're going to get like
