are more than four you know a billion mobile accounts out they are just going to be um uh the opportunity for that\nFor ... it up anti the it's the growth versus the cost because there's still a lot of risk here if the growth disappoints and slows down\nLet's move on to American Express which posted record revenue in the third quarter profits look good to Jeff out shares of em acts up this week and close to an all time high\nI Love the story of ... was just a handful of years ago that there are really struggling they were competing against a more aggressive campaigns for MasterCard and visa and they clamp down on their expenses and focused on their promotions and and they're all friends to go aggressively into markets where they were losing market share and now that\nThey've had six two consecutive quarters of adjusted revenue growth of at least eight percent\nA currency adjusted revenue just grew at ten percent\nThis last quarter to above ten billion earnings for showers up\nUh twenty five percent from the prior here so\nYeah American Express doing really well us consumer is thirty two percent of filling in that group double digits that that area of revenue grew by double digits again and international consumer growth was high at Eighteen percent so around the world they're growing the the brand has withstood the the challenges of previous years and uh\nIt it looks like a their outlook is trying to\nStick with the war on cash sheriff pay pal holdings up on friday third quarter profits and revenue same in higher than expected injuries in the ... division looking strong\nYeah it is looking strong ending a pay pal generally speaking I mean they're attacking the commerce industry from so many different angles and I think a lot of that\nA lot of their success relieves thanks to the fact that from inception it's been about utilizing technology mobile reducing friction making it easy to move money from point a to point B no matter where you live and and I think they've done a really good job with that\nAre expanding beyond just pay pounding obviously of andme owes you mentioned the abs zoom so it is a global business from that perspective a when you look at the metrics say they all indicate good things total painted volume up twenty four percent of one hundred and forty three billion dollars flowing through the network transactions which is essentially engagement\nGrew nine and a half percent a on a trail twelve month basis in mobile payment volume of fifty seven billion dollars was up forty five percent from a year ago so all signs point to ah what they're doing is working out in regard to ... it's a good point\nOf that then mo is performing the results for the quarter showed Seventeen million dollars of that total payment ... Seventy million dollars that total a minimal employees ... through ...\nI think that what we need to do though is we need to pay attention to the coming quarters because this really doesn't reflect\nThe new fee schedule but they've introduced in regard to the instant funding uh regarding van ... and I you know we've seen at least some signs that that might be rubbing some younger consumers the wrong way so that I think is the one thing we really need to keep on our radar because they are just starting to learn how to monetize memo up but again I think they\nTaking the whole picture into consideration or they're doing a lot of things well and I think that's what the that's what the stock is showing us today\nI'll just add that American Express just signed a deal it pay pal you pay your bill through pay pal which I mean if that doesn't give pay pal even more\nSo the stock is finally looking less expensive too at transit about twenty nine times forward earnings for sure estimate a church raised a hundred times for cash flow but facility for the growth on hand\nBut it it's amazing how the spaces changed I mean you look at it today if you pay pal is a bigger company that American Express and mean then that that happened\nSeemingly overnight but but I think more and more interesting to me like visa MasterCard American Express recognizing the fact that companies like a pay Palin square and strive to have really these platforms born ON Technology was sort of a new mentality\nVisa MasterCard American Express they rather than acquiring are having to find a new way to participate and partner up with these companies as opposed to just being left out in the cold completely so kudos to American Express for for making that happen I think we'll see more of that kind of stuff going forward\nI'll just say pay pal generate massive amounts of free cash flows like Japanese expensive gas is growing but like the mill acquisition I'm now than we ... then mill use writing the ... million dollars for that business maybe I mean that I think there's going to be a real healthy return in that business when you look over the next ten years\nFrom the war on cash to the rise of the machines intuitive surgical third quarter revenue up fourteen percent shares in terms of surgical down after this report and ... year to do this is the stock with still up about thirty five percent of\nThat is right Chris I mean it was an actually really nice quarter I mean this is just a business that makes the da Vinci robotic systems now that more and more hospitals are using when you think about sales up Seventeen percent for that business the procedure grow up with a number of growth the growth in procedures with their systems up twenty percent globally that's Nineteen percent in the U.S [noise]\nEnd up twenty three percent in a internationally so the growth of the the units and the growth of the services and the procedures that intuitive surgical supplies\nContinues to be in demand it's growing and it really healthy clip yes the stock is up to sixty billion dollar mark cat now\nAs almost five billion in cash on the balance sheet\nZero debt it's been a lot of money buying back stock of the last year and a half or so um so it sells at around fifty times earnings and like thirty times maybe I'm operating profits on the line so you know maybe it looks a little bit expensive here to me um but I think overall the business continues to perform really well\nYeah and one thing we love about it is a recurring revenue is now Seventy two percent of total revenue it's accessories and instruments related to the to the machines\nYeah we were talking earlier today and in the production meeting a friend of mine a listener Dr shot Huggins guy grew up with in\nThose and Boy Scouts where these positioned down in in Savannah now cardiologist says that those machines\nAre just that is the new way of doing business hospitals are buying those machines training doctors in every hospital from age ca hospitals to small town hospitals so I mean from a patient's perspective I think you have to feel pretty good about that I'm In front of investors perspective I think you have to feel pretty good about that\nCall a civilian gets orange\nAre often go fast enough to fall down way register online it only\nFor my family than important for

my money for say earlier this week Canada's largest country in the world fully legalized recreational use\nOf marijuana joined me in Studio to discuss these investing implications there's multiple senior enlisted a craftsman thanks for being here Thanks Chris this was front page news all across Canada how big a deal is this\nThis is a big deal like you said Canada's taking a like a huge step as the largest country in the world to legalize adult use of recreate recreational cannabis so\nEssentially what this means is if you are a resident of Canada starting October seventeenth you can walk into a a candidates retailer or order online\nCandidate is just like you would walk into a store and buy a beer so\nThat this is a monumental step obviously up until this point you've you've seen Canada and other states in the U.S and other countries embrace medical cannabis but this is a big step toward full legalization of recreational cannabis across the board\nYou been doing a lot of research on this industry over the past year I Know you've been joined conferences or across North America what is the competitive landscape looked like for businesses in Canada\nRight now you have a ton of companies jockeying for position of this emerging recreational market in Canada so you have some of the big players are Kennedy gross Aurora candidate is a free uh can't trust a variety of different companies that are out there\nAnd up until this point they've been able to operate within the landscape of medical cannabis within Canada which is a pretty small market\nThen all of a sudden starting October seventeenth we will suddenly be able to see which of these companies are gaining traction with consumers a building brand things of that sort so you have some of these companies that are approaching\nOne million square feet of space that they've dedicated to grow candidate is a but up until this point you have a lot of these companies are saying how great they are going to be in starting October seventeenth in in in the coming quarters and years will finally get a sense for which these companies are walking the walk not just talking to the\nTop part of the reason this industry is getting so much attention is because you've got large companies from outside the industry who are either investing directly or certainly kicking the tires and I'm thinking mainly the beverage companies Coca Cola Pepsi constellation rent wire beverage industry companies so hot for marijuana\nYeah constantly shouldn't brands are which is best known for grown up but they have a variety of brands and they're whining spirits portfolio they really made a big splash in that category last October when they were essentially the first multinational company to say hey we're comfortable with this murky legal landscape of candidates we see an opportunity here and they invested\nIn Kennedy growth which is one of the larger Canadian candidates producers and constellation re ups that investment in a huge wave this August when they invested an additional ... million dollars into Kennedy growth basically saying that they expect us to become a two hundred billion dollar global legal market by\nTwenty thirty so they see a big opportunity here\nI think part of the reason you're seeing these beverage companies especially alcoholic beverage companies\nTaking a closer look a candidate is is because in some ways ... is a competitor to alcohol a lot of ways are ... candidates doesn't have the same caloric content I think more and more circles candidates is seen as a healthier replacement to alcohol to get kinda that relaxation are that high effect\nOr in states like Colorado where you've seen a legalize recreational cannabis\nYou're even seeing some headwinds with a beer and alcohol sales as people transition over to consuming canvas instead of alcohol\nAnd even Aspen, Colorado you have an entire town where candidates sales are now out pacing alcohol sales so it would behoove you if you are a beverage company to pay close attention to this kind of his opportunity I think that's why you're seeing more and more of these big a beverage companies to get close to look a candidate so Canada\nIs fully legal in terms of recreational use but here in the United states\nWe've got a handful of states with varying levels of of legality um we've got a few more on the ballot for the midterm elections um but it doesn't seem like we're anywhere close to the same sort of legalization of the nation wide basis as Canada is where does the U.S for them to all of this\nYeah the the tricky thing about the U.S is that on a federal level like you mentioned\nCanvas is still considered an illicit illegal drugs or the drug Enforcement Administration actually considers candidates to be a more dangerous substance then cocaine and math so that just kind of shows you where it while it's the priorities are these days but at the same time you still have a variety of states which have\nTaken steps to legalize cannabis in some shape or form you have over thirty states now that have legalized\nMedical campus so if you have a you know headaches or some other various elements or you can get a prescription and purchase medical cannabis that way you have nine states like Colorado Washington, California\nAmong others that have legalized recreational adult use cannabis so in the U. S. you still have kind of a murky situation where the federal government technically at any time now could go in ... states that individually have legalized Canada so\nThat does end up at the risk a bit here in the U.S and\nGoing forward from the U.S perspective or when you're thinking about the cannabis industry domestically\nIt's really just a matter of what does the federal government do a President Trump has never really spoken out against legalizing candidates or at least leaving it up to the states but at the same time attorney general Jeff Sessions\nUm has essentially ... left the door open for the federal government to intervene in states that have legalized candidate so that's\nThe ultimate murky question right now when it comes to legality and the U.S\nI've seen a bunch of people over the past three to six months or use the analogy of prohibition comparing the legalization in Canada to the end of prohibition in the twentieth century in the United states do you think that is an apt comparison", "show_name": "The Motley Fool Money Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "22"}
