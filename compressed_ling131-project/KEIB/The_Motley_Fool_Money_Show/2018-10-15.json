I asked her how you how she felt after the date and she said like um she said like it was like she said\nIt was like a little different but not so much from when how we normally hang out and I said the same thing to like yeah it was just for me very hard to like I don't know\nYou you these few or be your from your role as her friend to becoming her lover is a wider gap or chasm than you expected them am I right\nI think so and same thing for me like again it was just very hard for me to get into that\nYou know like be kind of cute or you know affects affectionate like it was just like I don't know is very difficult for me and I didn't think that was going to be hard for me but it was and and for her as well yeah so\nI'm getting the feeling that you guys should probably remain friends and that's about as far as it goes ... I mean I mean you're close to where she's your confidant\nAnd there's part of you which probably says if I Am this close to her and she is my confidant you go in there for if I'm moving in a line in a certain direction then we have to become boyfriend and girlfriend because we are already this we're headed in this direction let's keep going with on the other hand\nThe boyfriend girlfriend thing and I think semi stands with me on this is a is tangible mhm there are there are no benchmarks for when somebody crosses over being an acquaintance and a friend to someone that that you're in love with you know that you are you have sex with\nYou know ... it's ...\nIt's a feeling yeah there is there is there there's no okay\nWe have a checklist here and I ... off nine out of ten the only thing that's left is you know it's not the boots and now we're together you know it doesn't work that way is Sammy ... do you do this stuff for a living sometimes what would you say\nYeah I think you might have gone into it with expectations of what relationship and like relationship building should be instead of just going in and enjoying the\nTime yeah I I think that you believe it should work therefore it will work but the thing is on an emotional level it's not working\nSo there you go\nYou know we go with that in mind\nAs the future unfold one inappropriate melody to go out on\nSouthern

[noise]\nControversy continues over a missing journalist diamond Carrick Fox News Saudi Arabia is responding to President Trump's comments about canceling arms sales because of the missing journalist ... ... the president said the U.S would be hurting itself if it allowed the kingdom to buy weapons elsewhere\nYou better understand that momentum goes both ways and so what goes up does come down common you know physics tells us that um hopefully they go up more than they go down but Wendy stocks are that have been on a tear come down they come down rather severely\nThat can create an opportunity to pick up shares as they get cheaper if you have the stomach for the volatility um sometimes I see people jumping in a little too soon you know they see one day is a company dropped two percent and they say oh it's time to get in to resent in a in the in the scheme of things when the ... the hundreds of present it to the point is nothing\nBut it is it's important to see what pockets of of the the market are really bringing bringing the ... market as a whole down\nYeah I think it's really easy to get into a situation like doesn't get nervous a particularly if you if you're a relatively new investor um we like to quote Warren Buffett all the time here there was one one quote on the pushback on I'm a little bit because you know he he said something to the extent of diversification is for people who don't know what they're doing something to that effect\nAnd I get what he's saying there is like if you know what you're doing and really you can go ahead and concentrate your best and feel good about how you're investing a I think for the most part people need to focus on a diversification I think this is a great example of the time were diversification can help\nCombat the emotions that you likely feel involved will times like these I mean we invest a certain way obviously long term in mind\nWe have a lot of this growth names in our portfolio okay in in a lot of that growth has been full poll for these valuations today so to see them take a hit is not surprising but if you have some nice stayed given an aristocrats for example in your portfolio to help counter or those high growth named then this ... becomes a lot easier to stomach\nWell that was one of the things we talked about last week Ron was\nWe're seeing interest rates going up we're seeing ten year treasuries at a seven year high and\nYou know another thing we talked about this morning was just sort of the speed I mean that's it's not just the the market was going down as it is the speed with which we're seeing these drops and I have to believe that at least part of this is that rising interest rates and the relative attractiveness of stocks going down ever so slightly for\nSure interest rates are very very big part of this and not only to higher interest rates make borrowing costs for companies hire which lends to them having declining profits as a result of increasing costs\nBut higher interest rates create alternative investments um that make the stock market perhaps less attractive than it looked when interest rates were low you could if you can earn three percent at a risk free tenure U.S Treasury\nMaybe you don't want to own the two per cent dividends stock unless of course you think there's appreciation potential on top of that to be had but you started to think about it a little bit and do the math and certain subsets certainly a subset of investors say I'll take the three the three and a half percent kind of safe money\n[noise] yeah I think rising interest rates impact shorter term investors are traders more than the impacts of fools like us who have a long term time horizon were often investing with the intent to hold these companies for at least five years and ideally you have ten twenty Thirty years and then the grand scheme of things there\nWere interest rates ... go from one quarter to another one year to another probably doesn't matter as much when you're thinking in terms of decades not quarters or years\nUh but at the same time you're seeing all the talking heads on CNBC and MTV who do often have a shorter term time arise and that's all they talk about uh so you can't just ignore it but keep that a longer term picture and perspective and I think the interest rates turn out to be more noise when it comes to the individual companies their portfolio\nAnd just to double down on something that Jason mentioned about diversification you just have to remember that the volatility that we've seen this week of is the norm not the exception when it comes to the stock market so build your portfolio accordingly position\nYour portfolio in such a way that you can kind of ignore this inevitable short term ... as best you can and keep that long term time horizon in mind for some people that might mean having a little bit more cash on the side to take advantage of market declines like this it might mean diversifying into some more stable companies like Jason mentioned but\nAnd I think there will be more scrutiny from a investors and Wall Street on house where it goes about this finding a replacement for because still Jack Dorsey is CEO at Twitter and square and Sarah like Jason mentioned has really been the public face of square and almost operating more is the co CEO alongside Dorothy so\nWho who they find to replace her will uh be important you had me at cupcake\nSears falling again this week on reports that the company's preparing to file for bankruptcy as early as this weekend a wrong Sears is working on some financing deals that could potentially keep them open through Christmas\nHere we go finally right and it's I think it's to liquidate or not to liquidate that's the question\nChapter eleven reorganization or chapter seven liquidation I think I'm\n... wants to keep this afloat he wants to get some injuring ... interim financing to make it through Christmas he wants to shut a bunch of stores he wants to try to reorganize this thing to keep it going I'm not sure the banks agree um it might be time to for them to take whatever they can get 'em and liquidation and and just go home\n... I mean if you're at the ... who's lending them money at this point with the way the ... run that company for the past however many\nYears you know reports or the bank of America and Wells Fargo are in talks with them for emergency financing that doesn't necessarily mean long term financing they do have a hundred and thirty four million dollars of loans coming do I want to say on Monday so that's when we actually could see the bankruptcy bankruptcy filing\nSo our Wal Mart and target sort of the uh the slight beneficiaries of Sears if the liquid ...\nI guess so but I think they've been benefiting along from this low demise or email address is radio at full dot com question from Phillip Green rights there's been a lot of talk about investments being made in cannabis companies from outside the industry\nDo you think the back of companies are looking at cannabis legalization as a strategic opportunity seems to me that there would be fewer logistical hurdles on the part of these companies that already grow and distribute a variety of leafy products everybody thinks\nFilled called it a ... this week is rumored that ultra ah is rumored to be looking to invest in a Canadian candidates producer at a free is the name that keeps coming up\nUh as far as the producer they're looking at within Canada I think the biggest question here is why did it take so long because it's been almost a year since constellation brands first invested in Kennedy growth and they bring up that investment in a huge way in August\nAnd along the way you have more and more of these multinational companies getting more comfortable I think with the legal framework of the legal cannabis industry in Canada and elsewhere Coca Cola ... pepsico all mentioning that other sort of at least keeping an eye on it explained potential uh partnerships with Canada's companies and Canada\nBut I think this is a testament to the fact that these companies are getting more comfortable with the idea\nThat the U.S federal government will intervene with these kind of deal so far constellation brands hasn't dealt with really any legal headwinds at least from the U.S government so\nIt's probably a an indication that these companies expect full federal legalization of candidates to happen in the U.S sooner than later yeah if you're on the board of directors of ultra and you see Coca Cola Pepsi or checking the tires on this industry yeah you have to be wondering why you're not\nYeah and and you also have to take a step back and realize that per capita cigarette consumption at least in the U.S is a big cut in half since two thousand so there clearly headwinds when it comes to tobacco use but\nCandidates of is potentially a healthier alternative to get a similar\nHigh and you know kind of fill the gap that is being lost with cigarettes\nAre guys we'll see you later in the show up next a conversation with cybersecurity expert Bruce Schneier Sarah here this is ...\n\n\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute of maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call a\nWelcome back to my mind I'm Chris Hill whether it was Equifax last fall or Facebook and Google Plus just in the past few weeks hacking\nHas very much been in the headlines Bruce Schneier is a security technologist an author of several books including his latest entitled click here to kill everybody security and survival\nIn a hyper connected world Bruce joins me now from Boston Bruce thanks so much for taking a few minutes to talk more thanks for having me\nSo click here to kill everybody kind of a dire title although you tell me how bad is the problem because it's certainly getting a lot of attention\nAnd it's a different problem that I'm Talking about we're talking about data in equal facts Facebook\nGoogle Plus member the target breach of Personnel Management those are all somebody stole and misused data but I'm writing that is something different I'm writing about the new world of physically capable computers where it's no longer\nPhones and servers and laptops its cars and medical devices and power plant and home thermostats and appliances it's computers that affect the world that Iraq physical manner and they're the issue is a loss of data there the issue is loss of life and property\nSo security is not getting better but the threat model is changing because of how computers are being used\nSo one of the things that has been talked about with reference to a company like Tesla is that as\nTheir vehicles gets more dynamics get smarter you've heard people say well it's not so much a car it's a computer that you can drive ... knowing what you know are you more likely or less likely to be interested in driving a vehicle like that\nAnd we're not going to have much choice because it's not necessarily\nA computer assisted the vehicle like a Tesla it's it can be the connected vehicle like everything else I tried to buy a car last year that was not on the Internet and I felt they did exist but not in the fare class I wanted and this is\nA security problem it's it's complicated but\nThis is dangerous we don't know how to build computers that can't they hacked and captors Asian or they car as a computer with four wheels an engine\nI mean really it's a hundred plus computer distributed system at school we as a mention is accurate just like your refrigerator is a computer that keeps things called me a microwave others if you're that makes things hot an ATM machines can be good money inside these are computers they fail like computers they can be hacked like computers\nYet the consequences is someone disabled or break something disabled steering there's a great video on YouTube now recorder from wired few years ago is in a car and researchers take over the car remotely from ten miles away purse it's fun and games that turned the radio\nThe turn of the windshield wipers\nAnd they disable the steering\nAnd they can disable the brakes this is worrisome so well before you get to a a driverless car Tesla a car that next stay in the lame decisions\nNormal cars can be hacked and have key functionality disabled\nSo is this something that you see the marketplace solving is this a situation where\nCompanies just have to get better about building in security for whether it's a smart home device or a vehicle or at some point does regulation need to step in\nThis is a hundred percent mark and failure what we have today is what the market delivers so let's talk about equal sacks last year my they lost the ... of every single American\nAnd they were very angry Congress people I testified before the house they were angry people on both sides aisles something must be done this cannot stand it's now a year and a month later nothing was done the lesson of equal facts with the market teachers is\nUnder spent on security I Do a lousy job get to market quicker half more features take your chances if you get unlucky whether the ... the crest storm\nAnd you'll be fine that's the lesson Facebook is learning today I a lot of very angry congresspeople no thing will happen\nI see no way to solve is of the regulations and the markets cannot solve it and and in a sense that's not a surprise there isn't an industry in the past century and a half that has improved safety and security that being forced to buy the government's planes automobiles\nPharmaceuticals food production medical devices restaurants consumer goods workplace most recently financial products and again and again the smart business thing is to have lousy products at the public will buy\nAnd do your best after the fact to duck any real cost for that insecurity or an safety now in my book I I talk primarily about policy solutions and there's a lot of tech to do but policy is the key here\nSo you mentioned your attempt to buy a car I'm curious Jim and everything you know given everything you've written about\nHow has this affected other parts of your life do you for example not have a smartphone because of the potential for hacking do you avoid smart home devices that sort
