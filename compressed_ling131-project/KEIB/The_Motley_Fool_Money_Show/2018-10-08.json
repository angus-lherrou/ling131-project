Capital Management and someone who was wrecked up incredible investing track record is also the author of the new book mastering the market cycle getting the odds on your side\nEarlier this week ... bill man talk with mark about the state of today's market confidence and overconfidence we took off the conversation with Mark's talking about what causes market cycles\nYou know starting at the University of Chicago or in the sixties or people even before the computer age figured out\nWhat the return on stocks had been since twenty nine to sixty two I think they did the work nine point to present then it's been extended since then and sell stocks return nine ten percent a year on average right or wrong periods of time you know that\nThey've never actually returned exactly nine when super salty\nPoint I that's right and the point I was going to make is that they rarely returned between eight and twelve yeah many more observations are outside of the eight to twelve range than inside it's so ... you know my first observation is that the average is not the norm it stocks return ten percent a year on average\nWhy don't they just returned ten every year and the answer the biggest the answer is\nEmotional excesses to the upside which then require correction to the downside if you think about that the value of a company\nAnd what it's going to be worth and fifty years that does not change very much from day to day week to week month to month even year to year it's pretty stable or you know and as the changes in this year is where this quarter earnings are not that important\nBut people\nReact excessively to these things and uh we want to be on the right side of those reactions and not the wrong so\nWhen things are going well and the economy is humming and corporations are doing well they're reporting earnings which exceed on the upside\nUm the media are are issuing only positive reports and interpreting the news positively\nThe prices are going up for everyday people feel terrific they love the things they hold they want to go out and buy more the only people who are unhappy or the people who don't hold they want to buy for the first time\nAll of these things together produce rising optimism or rising you for you and straighter self satisfaction and consequently higher prices you know\nSo the as the prices rise\nThe motion turns more positive\nUntil you reach the top when the prices at its maximum and the motion is at its maximum\nNow that's when you want to be selling when the price of high end by definition very few people do because they are feeling so positive and of course the reverse is true in the opposite direction and I will not be labor it but at the bottom the price reaches its minimum\nAt the same day that the investors are the most depressed and the most unlikely to buy so we must do the opposite\nWe must stand against the herd we must stand against mass psychology we must sell\nWhen fundamentals are at their peak and emotions are the most positive and we must buy when a fundamentals are at the trough and people are most is depressed\nA lot of people who will be reading and listening to this will think that what you were talking about is market timing but you're not you're not talking about getting in and out of the marketed the right time you're not talking about reading the tea leaves and thinking about the trade sanctions in China and pulling out of certain parts of the market and\nYou are you are talking about focusing on the areas where there is opportunity based on based on what is out there and where the markets there isn't any given point in time\nExactly I'm nothing in the book nothing that we do at oak tree is based on forecasts ... what I say about an hour you know a ...\nI Am strongly opposed to facing investing on forecasting and what I say is we never know where we're going but we sure as hell water no where we are you know where is the market in the cycle is it depressed or elevated when it's depressed\nThe odds are in the buyers favor and when it's elevated the odds are against him and it's really as simple as that and you know we should\nYou or your listeners should distinguish\nBetween markets that are high end their cycle and markets that are low they should very their behavior on that basis they should take more risks when the market has lowered its cycle less risk when the market is high and it's like all this is not saying\nYou know who's going to win the election what will the earnings be one will rates the increase you know so many people ask me for so many years what month\nIs the interest rate increase going to take place\nAnd I would say why do you care [laughter] that's not what matters what matters is whether interest rates are going up or down whether it's going to go up a lot or a little and people don't understand how money is made you know they think that knowing which month the interest rate increase is going to take place is going to make money", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Motley Fool Money Show", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "08"}
