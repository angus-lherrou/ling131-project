conduct they limited supplemental investigation into the sexual misconduct assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh boxes chat program with what to expect and waiting\nIt's a difficult situation so I Would hope that you must of his own volition would recognize that maybe this is a time to take a step back you can remain an advisor and still be involved in the company but you need some help at this point\nI'm floored that the stock hasn't gotten punished more than it's gotten punish to be honest with you I mean it's still forty six billion dollar company or something like that and I mean it doesn't look like they have any real clear path to profitability anytime soon and this is only going to hurt their situation I mean things just don't really look all that great in the near term so\nFrankly surprised that the stock is still getting as much credit as it is\nNike's first quarter revenue came in just shy of ten billion dollars but shares of Nike were flat this week so this is a great company but this increasingly looks like a pricey stock\nYeah and it looked it looked like I had a hard time decoding Wyatt wife you just\nLook at you know a page on the Internet it looks like a trading for like a sixty five multiple which is crazy and they had a big tax bill in the trailing twelve months which move things about a buck and a quarter so\nAnd I'm more normalized basis they're they're trading at about thirty five times earnings which may not sound like a lot but you have to consider Nike is already a huge company it's growing the top line and this sort of\nA eight ten percent range digital going quickly and they have some interesting innovations that might help them a lot on the costs side a and shoes\nAre but it's still it's still tough to swallow on the other hand there returns on Capitol are great and they are doing a super job of connecting directly with consumers through apps people can order a specialized shoes that way and so their uh their wholesale shipments have been good they're doing an amazing job in China\nAnd so there's still a lot of growth left here and people are willing to pay up for it\nYeah I agree on the valuation friend really no matter which way you slice it the devaluation looks to be on the price their end of the spectrum another way to look at it is the dividend yield which right now is under one percent which is toward the lower end of its historical range over the past five to ten years so I'm personally a Nike shareholder built up a position over the past couple of years\nAnd I'm thinking maybe maybe this is a time to delight in that position a bit and uh it if and when the price does drop or the valuation of proof that the way it looked to maybe build up a position again\nYeah I mean this is this company should definitely be on everybody's recession west wish list you know I don't know if I'd I'd buy it right now but you know and the other hand maybe I Would remind myself to buy some some more later if I drop they're doing a great job they've they've really fend it under a set it off Under Armour Adidas has a strong competitor\nAnd they're just growing like a weed everywhere except North America which is only about six percent growth and don't forget about humor\nOver ma ma absolutely and I I think ... if you can certainly argue that the company does deserve a premium valuation I'd say we're still on the high end of the spectrum here but I mean the company generated what four billion dollars are free cash for the past year that continues to increase of really strong across the board\nBill resorts wrapped up its fiscal year with a loss and the fourth quarter fell resource management of the company suffered from historically poor winter conditions which David when you're in the business of ski resorts that's got to hurt\nIt hurts but the impressive thing about a veil resorts is that the models that they've been shifting to selling season passes a that's helped really smooth out those results like that it's a seasonal business but especially in the western us\nYou've had a less than fifty years left less than fifty percent the average snowfall\nOr over the winter but over that same period resort revenue actually increased ... percent so they they've really found a way to a smooth out the edges there with that business and they are increasingly diversified across the globe um Whistler\nUh up up in a British Columbia had strong results um their new resort\nA ski resort over in Australia is doing well and now they have a partnership in Japan so\nEurope as well so having that diversification across the world are bringing more people into the season passes trying to um increase repeat visits it's really helped a smooth out the business of despite that season ...\nMix third quarter report for McCormack spice makers profits look pretty good but overall revenue was a bit like still Jason I mean this is the rare packaged food company that's doing well\nI mean remedy was a bit like let's be very clear just ... I mean really to round up the shake ... dashed there you go I think a McCormick ... everybody knows I Love this company but I think that's for good reason\nOr the R B foods deal that was announced a little bit over a year ago is no longer a question Martin ... it was a smart deal it was well executed\nThe stock is up to forty percent since that deal was announced\nFrank's infringes which is what they got from the deal contributed about ten percent to the forty percent revenue growth with a quarter they've added distribution for those for those powerhouse brands to twenty new countries year to date as well\nSo what that is playing out in ... expanded operating margins are there are seeing some lovers flows remodeled larger global footprint and I think another thing to remember here is that\nThey can absolutely in time make another meaningful acquisition down the line and and actually I I think they will because when you really do have\nThe market leader in the flavors and spices

P. Morgan and Credit Suisse investment banks were already talking to lift about that role of lead underwriter and then you know ... seems like it's on a slower track\nI'm Dara or the c._e._o. talk out late too that's at Nineteen of course has raised a lot more capitals probably got a higher burn right um but you know he upset about it now in his tenure [noise] you know reducing not burn right getting out of markets like where you know where they just weren't competing like south east Asia and Russia\nUm you know trying to right the ship in terms of the company culture and the and the driverless car initiative so I don't know I mean it's going to be an interesting year they both go public but you know at this point even though the company's ... particularly Cooper had bumps in the road I don't think you can dismiss the the fact that this is\nA big market that both companies are doing very well and\nWe've seen recently the ideal market gets a little frustrated with companies like survey monkey an event prior to having these big opening days does any of that cause any of the people that you've talked to was ... lift\nTo want to move up the timeline a little bit\nYou know I I I haven't heard that I mean I think there is a sense that you know they've got the leaf management teams had they're kind of work cut out for them in getting the numbers making the numbers palatable I'm filling out the management teams I'm you know\nAnd and and here's where I'm sort of losing track and things but like the ... you\nKnow ... hired a CFL I Can't I Can't quite recall where where um they did they did earlier in the air that's right um but um but you know but that's relatively recent that's two dozen Eighteen like they had a lot of work to do and they still do\nUm and and so no I don't think that the current environment and look the economy is doing very well these companies have raised a lot of money and nothing you know sources of private capital have not\nA dried up in Silicon valley you know ...
