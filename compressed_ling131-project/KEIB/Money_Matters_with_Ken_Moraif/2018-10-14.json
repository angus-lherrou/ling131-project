we'd levels the old magnesium and vitamin D and seek to why\nIt's just not in our diets anymore I've talked about the things that compete with its soda pop and coffee is a direct conflict but it's just not in our foods today 'cause it's not\nIt is we use phosphate fertilizers that it it was dropped out of our food chain this is where dietary supplements come in and filling the gaps\nId you know

us and we don't have enough in the American diet\nSo it's a very very important that we get magnesium but I Know Ninety percent of you gonna run to the store and get the most economical magnesium

healthy sweet lord knows we could all use more healthy sleep right I mean talk about the study I saw on\n... mid December ... when they ... five hundred milligrams of magnesium to forty six older patients for eight weeks and the folks\nTeaching the magnesium got some major benefits they fell asleep after the experience he significant increase in sleep time and even sleep proficiency but in the placebo group got nobody was really it it seems like a really big deal to explain\nDo they do it to you in a torture chambers they they deprive you sleep in your immune system crashes we've got to have our sleep and of course a lot of us are trying and\nAh we have irregular schedules\nWe we got electricity and when we got electricity we tend to stay up to more hours and then we go to that later and we ... we were just depriving ourselves we're not in a rhythm with the earth is the issue it's not just the hours of sleep it's the rest full sleep and they did some brainwave\nFunction tests you get these deep sleep waves that you're getting so that you get that deep breath\nIt's a certain hour the morning there about two o'clock in the morning\nIs when you're supposed to be getting those so you need to have that the rest of sleep and of course you want to wake up refreshed that's what this study showed they gave a of a the amount that is here in this\nFormula mag vantage that's what the cave and so it's important and I I Know it when you're sleep deprived and let me tell you\nAnd there are lessons to be learned about that and in fact\nYou know I was talking to a relatively new client\nAnd they were asking me how does how is this field right now versus two thousand seven you know before the big drop that came in two thousand and eight and as you guys know we we told everyone listening to the show and our clients everybody in November of oh seven or to sell to get out of the stock market\nAnd so he was asking me is is different now than it was back then and that and I thought you know what that's actually a great question to talk about on the radio show so I'm going to answer his question too with you is this two thousand and they all over again there's little marine colonel scare [noise]\nWell you know what are those of you are old enough to remember Matt Dillon from gun smoke there was an episode that I'll never forget and the famous line or but at least for me that he said he said man who's not afraid he's a fool [laughter]\nOkay so you don't want to be a full so we'll talk about that and I also uh as I said you know we specialize in working with people who are retired retiring soon uh most of our clients are over fifty\nAnd so we talked about the risks that you face one of the things as a financial planner you know we want you to enjoy the best retirement that you can we want you to have your second childhood without parental supervision we want you to go play enjoy whatever it is that you want your retirement look like\nAt the same time though to make that happen I Believe we have to protect you from the wrist\nThat could take it away from you okay so this week I Want to talk about where we were on a series of the Eighteen risks based in retirement\nAnd I want to talk about number six which is called frailty risk which is essentially the risk that your cognitive skills deteriorate as you get older and how do you plan to head for that and unfortunately it is something you need to plan for now speaking of planning for stuff\nOne of the most foundational basic question that you have to think about if you haven't started collecting Social Security already is when do you apply\nAnd so uh we're talking about that or this week we're going to have a a segment on went to apply for Social Security\nAnd ah we may not be able to get to all the questions that have lined up that I think you might be interested in so if we don't we'll continue it next week as well now one of the things I mentioned at the top of this show was that uh you know we work as I said with people who are retired are retiring soon for the most part\nAnd so we believe that maintaining what you've spent your life building your investments your your net worth\nIs job number one if we're going to be able to generate the income to give you the lifestyle that you want okay so therefore we believe that by hold which is you buy a bunch of investments high quality stuff and you create a great portfolio you re balance it and your job is done our view of that is that it's it's an incomplete strategy\nYou need to have a third part to that which is you need to have a cell strategy and that's why you know is is that we told our clients to sell the November of oh seven and to stay out for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of all night and we didn't say to buy until June of old nine\nSo we're we're we're by holding cell\n[noise] so this week I Want to talk given to drop that we saw last week and not dramatically it happened and how quickly um I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself overtime time heals all wounds and all that good stuff your long term investor by whole too thick and thin\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if you are the aforementioned retired retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most of those who say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody don't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we all have our state tip of the week this is a part of the show leaves jam on where we talked about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust\nAnd this is where you can protect what you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and the state taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk about that about ten ...\nSo we've got a ton of get to but I Wanna just quickly\nGive a shout out to\nA ... a listener Laura if you're listening to talk about you [noise] um I mentioned last week that we have a a puppy and the puppy uh she had this submissive pink thing that she does and it's like the mom and she sees me\nYou know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon a pie right there she just squats and peace and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so the lord I heard this and she sent me an email to ... we had the best\nI can tell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura she says it's a retired veterinarian so if anybody knows it's her right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me your phone numbers you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time this week but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's okay [noise] anyway let's talk about is this a thousand and eight all over again okay so\nYou know I Want to go back to a you know two thousand and seven the end of two thousand seven October issue and all that\nAnd at that time\nYou know there were some clouds there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker a there was a inflation was picking up\nThe economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was the calm but there were signs there were some dark cloud let's say that it wasn't raining but they were dark clouds\nAnd uh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically and at that time people were saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell\nAnd by the way that's almost exactly what happened in Y. two K. and October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before it finally fell off a cliff\nSo is this like that\nI'm no in my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength\nUnemployment is showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape so we got a lot of signs\nThat no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it well basically it's a re calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raised interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up\nIf interest rates go up people buy fewer houses pure cars companies it costs more to borrow money profits go down so it's a re calibration is just adjusting to the new paradigm that's all so I don't think what happened last week of the beginning of a new bear market recession all that kind of stuff\nBut you know what it does do in my view it should be a wakeup call to you because did you did you see how fast it fell I mean it was like what eleven hundred points in two days I mean that's fast\nThe market when it goes down it goes down very fast and you can lose your retirement very quickly I mean you can you if you if you're about to retire and it goes down thirty or forty percent like didn't Y. two K. U. and two thousand eight and you'd write it down like that\nWhat would that do to your ability to retire or if you are retired what would that do to your ability to generate income from your investments\nSo that's why you know as I said we don't believe that by and hold is is sufficient okay it's great you should do that you should buy you should hold you should diversify all those things we believe that\nBut it's not sufficient you need to have a third part of that which is a protection mechanism and if if you're over fifty and your contemplating your retirement or you are retired\nWe want you to be a ... we want to help you plan your retirement make those decisions all the stuff that it takes we want to be there with you know there's no doubt so here's what I recommend\nGiving someone control is done normally through a power of attorney so you want to have the power of attorney that gives somebody the power to make financial decisions for you in the event that you are not able to um and that's called a durable power of attorney\nYou might also consider having a living trust okay because what a living trust does it names a trustee\nAnd so therefore if you are incapable of continuing as trustee you've already named who's going to step in and what the rules are et cetera so this is a very good second option in and one that we recommend in in a lot of states I'm now you also in a pre planned the documents\nThat describe\nThe things that uh would cause you to be incompetent okay so you want to have in their day activities of daily living and you and therefore uh this is called the guardianship document which basically spells out\nYou know not the financial decisions that need to be made but who's going to feed you drive you you know all those kinds of things against this isn't a pleasant topic I Know but if you're gonna be financially sound I think you need to think about all the things that could impact you negatively and if you have that taking care of if you plan to head for that\nThen you know hopefully it won't happen but if it does it doesn't you know devastate your situation All right I don't know how to say I think we accept like your guest so a couple of more tips one is make sure your finances are simplified\nYou know we tell clients you consolidate things make it easy for others to be able to find it all you know if you have stuff spread out over Seventeen different custodians and you've got accounts all over the place that's fine for you because you're smart and you've got your spreadsheet and your little list and all that\nBut can others recreate what you've done probably not and so you know do them a favor consolidated all that stuff simplify it and make it easy for somebody else to step in and take over the responsibilities\nAnyway now that's a risk number six and I hope that helps you know again we have all the risks are the first five us a risk to end this one uh posted on our website so you can go find them if you'd like to read them or listen to the podcast\nBut ... one thing I'd like to do is to invite you to come in a busy with one of our financial advisors I think you'll find them to be a knowledgeable friendly um and and competent and they uh they want to help you with your retirement planning All right so we want to talk with you about the important decisions that you need to make if

what I mean by that is you want to look at the sources of income you're going to have the expenses you're going to have\nAnd do you have the money to support the difference and uh that analysis

planning\nAnd ah the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there so let's talk about Social Security and what are the areas the probably the most important a decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is\nWhen do you apply for benefits okay and it's not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six or sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed any time between the ages of sixty two and Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of study and knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits if the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you started safety to they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nYou start when you're sixty six they'll pay you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to wait you're Seventy they'll do that even again\nWhat happens is they actually end up paying you the same total amount okay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a why would you want to delay it why wouldn't you take when you're sixty to\nThe problem is that most people will not outlive the will not live out an average life okay so uh you have to look at your life expectancy so\nAn average life means you live to be ... eighty six currently I think is the uh is is it is the life expectancy so you know I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a\nEighty you know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you\nKnow we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be so the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity and by delaying you'll walk up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get that higher benefit because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is higher okay\nIf you delay does a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you lived a life expectancy is the same\nOkay so something for you to consider now as I mentioned uh we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired are retiring soon and we look at ah we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty if you are retired or you are retiring soon [laughter]\nAnd we're here\nFor you in our goal is to help more people
