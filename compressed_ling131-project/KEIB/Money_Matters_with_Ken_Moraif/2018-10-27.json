sixty or eight Seventy five\nAnd a if you answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter] so so we'll talk about that now you know a jak most shows would actually stopped there that's a ... the show that is chock full of great info right and so most shows are just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to\nOf course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we're going to have our state tip of the week\nAnd normally that's you know that's a part of the show we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor\nBut this week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're gonna talk about paying for college and not having to pay a gift tax okay because the IRS [laughter]\nYeah those guys they want the tax gift and college in most cases has more is is is expensive and you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a\nWe think the boys and girls clubs as one as a charity that uh you know really helps young people do it to become solid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society in a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last\nSix years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've sponsored a program that's called a sponsor a child [laughter] and uh so we want to raise money for that and last weekend we had the gala at uh in in Plano in North Dallas and uh\nWe raised over a three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is\nReally really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven\nUm you know we we have as I mentioned they sell strategy or we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have a cell strategy and it's because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life you've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it\nAnd so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve will be have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells of philosophy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven and\nWhat I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens is that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to your cell signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right\nYou know you don't like being wrong obviously a and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand eleven our strategy said to sell both of those were very very near to bury markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and weren't\nAnd so technically those were you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent in two thousand eleven so that's not too bad the ... the U.S and pay 'em\nBut be that as it may\nThose two which we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out and uh those turned out to be near misses or they were close to a bear market but they weren't\nAnd the market to rebound quickly after that but in in ah in November of two thousand seven\nWhen that one came I was like oh no I Hope we don't you know I didn't want to sell because it felt like the economy was generally okay it felt like things were generally okay there was a lot of bad news everywhere you know it was the new news wasn't great but it wasn't terrible\nAnd so I was very feeling that I don't want to you know but of course we did and we we follow or discipline of and then the same thing is how I feel now\nYou know you look at it we just got GDP numbers that looked pretty good you've got a you know the consumers and this and that and generally the the all the indicators tell you things are are looking good right now\nBut yet our indicators telling us that we are close to getting ready to sell and I don't want to sell when things are looking good you know I don't want to be wrong but what's interesting is that that's how I felt to two thousand seven and of course so maybe I have a contrary indicator when I think it's right and wrong and what I think it's wrong I'm right\nOr it's right anyway whatever\nPoint being ladies and gentlemen is that if you are retired or retiring soon do you even have a strategy to protect yourself from the next market crash what if this is a market crash what if we're about to go into a trade war with China which I think we are now I'll change my mind I think we're going there\nAnd if that happens we could see the market go down to another two or three thousand points from here or maybe more if it's an average bear market it could go down another seven thousand points from here and are you going to stay in for that do you have a plan to address that if you don't you should be talking to one of our advisors are coming to one of our seminars to learn more about it okay I don't want you to get caught in this\nAnd so here's what you do

of course I Am your host Kendall\nRay [noise] like\nJack I've been a certified financial planner professionally for the last twenty marble is wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the same idea that we talk about with our blood and most valued clients\nI ... I Do and uh you know we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning and uh so we we primarily worked with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and we currently work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states we are blessed we are honored\nAnd in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisor refer money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers\nAnd uh that's the thing we're proud of but without our clients we ... probably wouldn't even have noticed we were on the map so thank you all your clients that are listening to the show and those of you who are not yeah there you go as well kiss\nFor those of you are not clients or if you're over fifty if you're retired or retiring soon\nI invite you to go to our website at his money matters dot net money matters dot net and when you were there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so do their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff\nWell this is the second to the show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that\nSo here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five refrain from claiming\nSocial Security until Seventy and still receive delayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent so if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security uh journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase so the question is it by enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nBut I don't collect so screwed I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but\nNot the other way around okay if you fall for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part egg All right so a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and his eighty years old\nAnd he applied for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited Fifteen escape twenty Fifteen Years okay so the applies now will his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get six months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth\nAnd it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about six months that age eighty or with all the delay credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for yeah okay so can apply as kind of person born in Nineteen fifty to repay his Social Security benefits to rent a receipt to date and then re file to obtain a higher current pay out\nOkay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so but ah I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter] that's good\nSo here's the answer if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and refiled okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file ss aid form five Twenty one\nSo so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they paid you and then re filed later All right\nSo uh that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question\nOr whatever you have this talk with Tom I Am too so um as I mentioned uh we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that ah that requires we want to help you with so uh we have seminars that I'd like for you to go to because\nAt the seminar we talk about do you have enough money to retire on we call that the magic number we want to show you how to calculate that number we we also want to talk about what our five strategies that you can use to reduce your income taxes during your retirement we're going to talk about how to maximize your cash\nFlow alright so once you retire you want to get income from your investments where'd you get it from that kind of stuff or we want to talk about should you roll over your four one K. um when should you take Social Security when you're sixty two when you're sixty six when you're Seventy when's the best time to do that we want to talk about the fact that the IRS\n[noise]\nMan she's afraid of that I arrest guy [laughter] I Can't blame her or the IRS once the tax eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits did you know that eighty five percent\nSo we went and you know what we want to show you how to beat that if it\nIs a tall possible we want to talk about diversification or how much risk should you take with your portfolio we have a way of calculating that we call it your herbal rate\nH U R D L E and so we're going to talk about that at the seminar we're also going to talk about three basic pitfalls of retirement income
