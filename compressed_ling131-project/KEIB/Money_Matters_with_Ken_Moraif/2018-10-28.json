this age a formula from purity products addresses these signs\nCertainly when we look in the mirror when we see well let's say we're twin brothers if we're looking one of us ages faster than the other how do we know that in a way of looking at our hair we're looking at our skin how smooth it is you're losing ha that's what your body's telling you how do you get it back\nJust think there is a way and purity products taking all the risk out all of the issues about you coming up with the dollars and everything they just want you to try because we're talking about replacing an all natural molecule in your body you can take this thousands have\nAnd of course number eight is very timely since it's called market risk [laughter] I didn't plan that ahead but boys are tightly right I'm I'm kind of going in order\nAnd a number eight is market risk so what that means is that when you are a retired person or you are about to retire um that is\nOne of the biggest risks that you face in terms of your investment is that you get hit by a big downdraft in your investments and now you don't have as much as you add wants hatch so are we are talking about numbers\nHey mark at risk now also since we are a a firm that specializes in retirement planning\nA one of the big topics that we talk about with clients are pretty much I Would say every time we visited seems like\nUm is Social Security so we're going to have some ... we had to have some questions or that or I Want to share with you and of course the answers to those questions about Social Security that I think might be on your mind so we're going to have the social ... does security queuing day\nNow also\nIn view of our philosophy so because we work with people who are mostly retired retiring soon our philosophy of how to manage your money is preservation of principle comes first okay we want to grow your money certainly we want to give you the income all those things are important but first and foremost we want to make sure that we protect your principal\nBecause for you to be able to go out and enjoy the all the things that you want in your retirement if you get hit by a big bad bear and it takes down twenty thirty or fifty percent of your money you know that's going to change a lot for you so I'm going to ask you the question the average bear market and this is according to net Davis research going back\nTo the great depression the average bear market\nIs a loss of thirty seven percent okay so it's an average now two thousand and eight the U.S and he went down to fifty seven percent and Y. two K. it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than average so but let's just go where the average thirty seven percent\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on in the show but all kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you if you had to of course you don't want to but if you had to\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money\nAt age sixty or at age Seventy five which one do you think would be better age sixty or Seventy five and a if you answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter]\nSo so we'll talk about that now you don't wanna jak most shows would actually stopped there that's a ... the show that is chock full of great in the right\nAnd so most shows are just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to of course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till\nWe're going to have our estate tip of the week and normally that's you know that's the part of the shall we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're gonna talk about paying for college and not having to\nPay a gift tax okay because the IRS [laughter] [noise]\nYeah those guys they want the tax gift and college in most cases has more is is is expensive\nAnd you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a we think the boys and girls clubs as one as a charity that uh you know really helps young people to the to become\nSolid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society in a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last\nSix years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've the sponsored a program that's called a sponsor a child [laughter] and uh so we want to raise money for that and last weekend we had the gala at a ... in in Plano in North Dallas and uh\nWe raised over a three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is\nIt is really really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven\nUm you know we we have as I mentioned they sell strategy or we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have a cell strategy and it's because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life you've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it\nAnd so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve will be have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells of philosophy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven and\nWhat I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens is that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to your cell signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right\nYou know you don't like being wrong obviously a and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two dozen eleven our strategy said to sell both of those were very very near to bear markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and where and\nAnd so technically those were you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent in two thousand eleven so that's not too bad the ... the U.S and take 'em\nBut be that as it may\nThose two which we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out and uh those turned out to be near misses a they were close to bear market but they weren't\nAnd the market to rebound quickly after that but in in ah in November of two thousand seven\nWhen one came I was like oh no I Hope we don't you know I didn't want to sell because it felt like the economy was generally okay it's not like things were generally okay there was a lot of bad news everywhere you know it was the new news wasn't great but it wasn't terrible\nAnd so I was a very feeling now I don't want to you know but of course we did and we we follow or discipline up and then the same thing is how I feel now\nYou know you look at it we just got GDP numbers it looked pretty good you got a you know the consumers and this and that and generally the the all the indicators tell you things are are looking good right now\nBut yet our indicators telling us that we're close to getting ready to sell and I don't want to sell when things are looking good you know I don't want to be wrong but what's interesting is that that's how I felt to two thousand seven and of course so maybe I have a contrary indicator when I think it's right and wrong and what I think it's wrong I'm right\nOr it's right anyway whatever point being\nLadies and gentlemen is that if you are retired are retiring soon do you even have a strategy to protect yourself from the next market crash what if this is a market crash what if we're about to go into a trade war with China which I think we are now I'll change my mind I think we're going there\nAnd if that happens we could see the market go down at another two or three thousand points from here or maybe more if it's an average bear market it could go down another seven thousand points from here\nAnd are you going to stay in for that do you have a plan to address that if you don't you should be talking to one of our advisors are coming to one of our seminars to learn more about it okay I don't want you to get caught in this\nAnd so here's what you do you go to our website it's money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd click on a link that says meet with an advisor or register for seminar whichever you prefer\nAnd uh if you click on meat with an advisor will schedule it time to visit with you\nAnd we'll sit down we'll review your ... your your investments how your diversified your retirement plans that work will talk about your uh income strategy your income taxes or we'll talk about an ourself strategy and we do a lot of that at the seminar as well so if you want to learn you want to be ready you want to have a plan\nAnd that era that's all the information is ever going to have and if the wind picks up the target moves you know something happens it's going to miss\nNow I hate guided missile on the other hand\nIt's constantly adjusting and its tracking the heat of its target and it's following it wherever it goes so that's what financial planning in my opinion is it's a heat guided missile that you are searching you you're constantly keeping your eye on making sure that your client never runs out of money that's the goal that the target and you adjust accordingly as you go\nA and I'm going to talk about later on in the show if if you had a preference of when you would have to lose money would it be earlier or later and we'll talk about I'll give you some more specifics on that so if you're retired or retiring soon\nThen one of the things you should be thinking about uh with some anxiety\nAh is what's been going on over the last few weeks you know this market is a shaping itself up and it looks like we may be on the verge of other bear market despite the good news and you know the thing about their markets as they come when nobody expects them I mean if if if you think about everywhere market this happened\nThe vast majority of people did not expect it you know if everybody expected it probably wouldn't happen right so\nTherefore it's important that you prepare for it so what I Want you to do is go to our website at his money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd when you were there we

we're going to take a break and when we come back we're going to have our Q A we're gonna have some fun Oregon answer some questions regarding Social Security to help you to strategize and make some good decision so stay tuned this is money matters and I am ...\nGiven attorney general election is Amr ...\nHorrible practical\nJokes and fast the person who wrote it and I don't have to register online it only five\nEvery time ...\nSays he's from\nJune ... says oh\nIs this [noise]\nAnd we are back this is money matters with Kendall rape and of course I Am your host Kendall\n[noise] thank\nYou Jack I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our blood and most valued clients\n... do and I you know we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning and uh so we we primarily work with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and we currently work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states we are blessed we are honored\nAnd in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers\nAnd uh that's the thing we're proud of but without our clients we'd boards probably wouldn't even have noticed we were on the map so thank you all your clients that are listening to the show and those of you who are not yeah there you go that's will kiss\nFor those of you are not clients or if you're over fifty if you're retired or retiring soon\nI invite you to go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net and when you were there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so do their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff\nWell this is the second to the show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that so here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nRefrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still receive\nDelayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent\nSo if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security a journalist for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase so the question is it by enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nBut I don't collect so screwed I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits the answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not the other way around okay if you file for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part egg All right\nSo a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and is eighty years old\nAnd he applied for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited ... twenty Fifteen Years okay so if he applies now well his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get\nSix months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not gonna be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth and it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about six months that age eighty um with all the delayed credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for you okay so can apply as kind of person born in Nineteen\nFifty to repay his Social Security benefits to risk or received to date and then re file to obtain a higher current pay out\nOkay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so but ah I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter] that's good\nSo here's the answer if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and refiled okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file ss aid form five Twenty one\nSo so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they paid you and then re file later All right\nSo that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question [noise]\nI've ever had this talk with Tom I Am too so um as I mentioned we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that ah that requires we want to help you with so uh we had seminars that I'd like for you to go to because\nAt the seminar we talk about do you have enough money to retire on we call that the magic number we want to show you how to calculate that number we we also want to talk about what our five strategies that you can use to reduce your income\nTaxes during your retirement we're going to talk about how to maximize your cash flow alright so once you're retired you want to get income from your

six when you're Seventy when's the best time to do that we want to talk about the fact that the IRS\n[noise]\nMan she's afraid of that I arrest guy [laughter] I Can't blame her ah the IRS less
