sports when I Hope that the clippers are able to add one on the on the good side of the largest\nDid the clippers find something in Houston all offensive Lee in that game because they scored a hundred and thirty three points me Los came out and play and his first regular season game so far this season he looked great and as I mentioned earlier Montrose Harold had his best game scoring wise of his career\nYou know I could make a joke about the deadly they found those used to defend three not very good but I think about Lyme\nColorado Anthony I think they will be fine speaking of the rocket but you know you get a great start to maybe Bradley and I don't care we've got to before I mean just getting that first shot feel good for anybody I don't care if you're the brawn James Michael Jordan or a guy that is struggling for the last few games\nBut they got everybody going and then I talked with DACA about this at the ballgame and all that we're getting today like the guy that stood out to me the most money was a ...\nWas ... I just love seeing them out there and the thing that he does I think it's better than anybody in the league\nIs I mean his touch time with the basketball is literally less than a second he knows what he's doing before that ball gets to an end it really is remarkable\nCan he be that missing piece play maker distributor out there for this team windy all fences in Iraq can you just insert me Los and all of a sudden things start flowing again\nI it it would seem that way like he's become more of a situational player like last year he was a started and he came off the bench and I think that's really where his role was best was he was coming off the bench but when you look at the lineup for the clippers not the most traditional line up you've got to\nThe guy who they Bradley impact Beverly who we love and I'm Glad they are out there and that's a lot of but they're not pure white guards there not claim acres I Would say you have maybe\nThree play makers on the team in order of mind of me Los you have a shady and then you have the needle gallon Ari showing me lawyers can get out there he will loosen things up he's taught Montrose in areas that I mean it was really remarkable how easy it was for him to get Montrose the ball and uh he's a lot of fun and he\nI I just wish she was ten years younger initially he had been a blur you'd have been an absolute studs\nHe did remind everyone what a great pass or he is in this league only me Los can find some of those windows that baseball path to Mike Scott all the way download our instead of the under ... marriage passed this was the over ... pass from Milan someone else who woke up in a big way off badly and it started the game before\nBut Lou Williams had Nineteen points in the first half\nHad twenty three in the game what was working for ... or was it just a matter of time we were going to see a scoring outburst eventually\nYou know I was at that practice the day before in Houston and dark kind of joke with them and said we have a\nAnd it's one thing with a brain ... when they struggle offensively they know how to play defense and their defense will make up for whatever potential shortcomings that particular night they may have all the ... foot from\nScratch all he does his store and I don't mean none of the negative way I mean he's out there to score professional score I wasn't worried about Lou at all on any level at all\nIt was a matter I think just finding his comfort level given the fact that he's not playing thirty five minutes so he doesn't have the blank canvas in front of a moment of tickets\nSpot here to pick a fight here to save a little bit more restricted now for him and it was what you see what's inside career took him three games because\nSo there's been scored eighty five points for the clippers last game most points scored by a bench and NBA games is twenty twelve when the pistons did it is this going to be the best bench in the league this season doc rivers said it was going to be a strange it's proven to be\nI Can't imagine that it won't be the only way what happens if obviously the stars get injured and then you're going to have to bring some guys up but this is going to be this is my and I mentioned this already before they're gonna have the best sense they're gonna be the best because she didn't have any MBA and I think you're going to be a top five effect\nAnd can we still call them the goon squad that tries herrell moniker that he gave him last year\nLike you have to change it every year I don't like the spot I remember several years in two thousand and swallowing the clippers had a great bench it was a you know what is our good friends than white people would call them or a tribe called bench I did not funny at all I thought that was I like mobs God I had that ...\nYeah it was ... but you know it's okay and so but I Will find something I'm your clever enough I think we're going to go with the really good clippers bench\nIt sure felt like a suburb ahead do an easy series victory but then injuries to see the three and Blake Griffin derailed their chances they did end up losing losing the next four games but that game six was ethic talk\nAnd the former Clipper thoughts and rivers now wizard was heroic in that game six remember he could only see out of one I [noise]\nThere's other I was completely shut you looked like smalls in the sand lot what then is Larry putting a stake up to it we still poured in Twenty one points in eight assists so unfortunately it was not enough the trail blazers went on to win well six to one oh three as

it's ... you want to do that transition happens [noise] um the great part about having a Patrick Beverly you're going to be with us for that matter is that you don't have to force that transition it can lead to kind of happen\nBeverly was coaching him on the side my I by the way I saw that guy that was great you know like get why it why it's now the fact that he got going by on that way like\nI'm not necessarily I think the coaching part of it but you know they got to turn around that and I think it's good that it seems like they've got kind of a work together relationship Beverly having seen the guy who you know I mean he knows that I mean his path to the NBA at this point anyway so remarkable that\nYou know I I don't think I don't you have someone who's been writing at this point by anybody I think to work with people and shop and he's a guy that can often use for a long time\nBut you know wish I had to bring back [noise] um I Do think that I mean eventually this team finds himself in contention I look at the court and say you know it'd be nice if they had a guy or back there because I was asked was coaching about this for about [noise] after talks about this last week when I was trying to um you know\nHoping to show a hundred and five point right it's hard to do in Twenty years like you know you're not really going to do that most nights most and I you know you're gonna have to score on her quote once aren't that you're going to come I feel like and I'm just I'm definitely going to need guys that can\nAlso go both ways and chasing like one of those guys I'm going to have to recalibrate now my my office in the sense of ratings you know ended up anything inside of\nYou know AAA figures defensive really wasn't like well this is a great defensive yeah now is she going to be like oh there are a hundred and three defensive right and that's a great deal for the league I yeah I mean I I was looking at it the other day and I think if there was that there was any I don't think it was a ...\nTeams play too fast you see so many so many\nGood when they held New Orleans to one sixteen [laughter] All right like not game\nYou can win a game at that point I mean I've seen a bunch of Laker games like you know when they're going to play in the one thirty and not just who they are and there are other teams you know when you guys see Dallas Dallas will try to shoot fifty three and their teams that are going to do these things you know Houston is definitely when they're clicking they're going to shoot forty three and a quarter\nAnd you know hold those old benchmarks of a hundred points forty percent shooting or whatever\nYou know you get all that he was shooting but if they're shooting forty seven three hundred and forty of 'em that that's an issue so you're going to have to kind of adjust to that stuff that I I think it's sort of a new day in terms of MBAs defense and you know I'm I talked to a progressive for the game and he made a great point you're like you said he use it like gardening\nIt's way right so a few garden Steph Curry like he knows that's probably going to just one\nWriter twenty seven you just want to make it as hard as possible to sweat it to the scores the score is going to be what it is and he said that's like basically now that's approaches every ... every often it's ... it's a you know what I mean like you just going to they're going to score on her point you just got to be you gotta just whether I could hearts it's\nSimilar to how the NFL way with all the rules favoring often says we're seeing that with the freedom of movement emphasis so far this season in the NBA maybe the rats won't let up and they'll let guys play a little bit more I think so as we go along yeah they're just trying to condition the teams that this is how it's going to be here there's going to be the slight\nChange my charts heroin last game had thirty points for the clippers his career high because he's only twenty four years of age during the right is she a you know still blossoming the players are more for Montrose Harold that we're going to see as things go a long hair because now this season he's showing things on the defensive side as well\nI mean I I think to me he he has the benefit of like there is such a clear role in place or imminently ahead of him that like ... it doesn't I mean he can just step into that is done with energy I'm you know the athletic like the tone of Dennis Rodman about that yeah\nThat no I really like that and I think you know it was funny I was thinking about players at like could help other teams and it's like very few all over the lead that could use my drugs hey I'd happily especially if he's running around on defense and guarding you know the guards centers in regard fours and you get sick and roles you could feel right\nAbout that I mean I think you know but his office of energy [noise] um you know when we saw him here you know the last week when we did this game like he was really struggling you could tell he was frustrated on the court [noise] um and I think justice that has to come with like\nYou know they only use only twenty four\nYears I have you know this is the leaves do yeah yeah you know so I mean he's a young players so [noise] um I I think kind of you know if you're going to be a guy that you can count on ever\nBut like I Do think he can have some sort of like kind of like tennis three types in fact\nSo are you gonna workshop tribe called then should do something over and creative or are we going to do too\nI mean ... yeah I don't I don't know I mean I'll have to look at\nLike that was intentionally ironically dumb right that's that's how we got it after a bad you're going to be bad I mean I mean here we are six years removed or you know what I thought okay so I was going to tell the story author I can tell you know like when when um when the travel ban something happened like there was someone that I mentioned at my Twitter account

have been made he can still put up some numbers will talk about his impact on what he will do\nWith the people that come in at one in four last year they had an injury influence record of forty three\nAnd thirty nine I say injuring influenced why\nWell John Wall mid town to see the ultimately found out in the first round so in the offseason otherwise um discontent at times that locker room whether it was perceived to be real or whether it was something they just wanted to clean up and they made a choice and\nThey said marching guard sought to Los Angeles clippers and in return Austin Rivers went to the Washington Wizards and I said this with doc rivers in all of a state again to\nAustin won some big games for the clippers in the playoffs he improved his NBA games to be an NBA basketball player when probably he wasn't when he was treated here and that was the goal for the clippers were was to find not just guys named Austin Rivers but players or the first round that were given up on their team when it came to that second contracts\nAustin was one of those guys they brought 'em in and they do is work ethic\nAnd he developed in a real basketball players and I mean this one I should get out of respect for a post doc at all\nI'm Glad he's somewhere else I'm Glad to get a chance to prove that it wasn't his father giving him that opportunity although it might follow him all the way around I expect Austin to shine this in Washington and I'm certainly rooting for him it's worked out the questionable she has a bravado that rubs people the wrong way but if you didn't have\nThat bravado he would not be a professional basketball player it is given him\nOut of the courage the belief in themselves to keep grinding when things got down and he was a terrific piece that thought\nFor the clippers and we certainly wish him well now the wizards are struggling they have not had a double digit lead all season long three of their four games ever does shot at by four points or less your defense struggles in the botched because all of those games as I mentioned have been within five points\nAnother five minutes and the defense tends\nTo fall apart now here's the situation in which the clippers better be careful what are we talking about\nOne of emphasis number one while we were in Hawaii was fast break points so wizard part third in the NBA an average one team one guy's break points they play at a pace that we have not yet seen for those who are\nFor advanced numbers their pay is a hundred and yelling\nAt that time it might as well be speed ... rpm for a car on the street that's how fast the guys won't go the clippers better be ready you're the clippers they come into bringing to bear twelve three against Houston back on a Saturday Night and they had ten total threes and the previous two games\nNow they've had some advantages here they've had some breaks obviously they didn't play Oklahoma City without rice they played two games against Houston one against the without Kris without James Harden they won both those games they are taking advantage of it and it was interesting coaches around the lake will tell you listed at the end of the year they\nDon't ask you how they ask you how many\nAnd right now the clippers have three when one of the reasons why the number one bench in the NBA they've\nMade more free throws than anybody else and they have the second best percentage when they get to the strike was we take a look at tonight starting months first of all the figure over five years back or there will be that defensive minded that court Patrick Beverly ...
