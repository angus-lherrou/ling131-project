called the barely legal radio program listening to the right thing everything else and all the other channels is really stupid right now so a welcome we talked about show business here and everybody's interested in that\nThis is the business part of show business the the legal part but first of all uh I haven't\nSeen you guys in a while and we have you seen any great movies I bet you guys all saw them because you know stunted men children could not even sort of be bothered but I did see a great movie was so star is born last night oh good good it was good really really good very high ratings a point foreign IMDB very rare yes cheaply for my email\nOr southern none really great comedy and among huh mhm good morning really funny it was just ... ... has everything you want in an economy that's

it also got a point for reading on IMDB which is very rare because this has got one of those like\nYou know Christian backing thing like people at church they tell you got to go see guys now\nAnd um it got to support family movies that kind of stuff is this is a family movie about a serial killer yeah yeah but then it got to a point where it usually those kind of movies get a really bad writing 'cause\nThe people that are against Christianity go one IMDB in these things and they give them a zero ratings when ratings to too I think it becomes a political fight with people that's just so so when I see a religious movie and I see the rating I usually at two or three starts to it right I Do it's just not that bad but they\nBut this one already has an eight point four so I'm\nJust pretty pretty major deserved eight point for it or not you don't have to add to stars and call it a template for 'em but\nNow is about a um a a an abortion is gone berserk just went nuts and kill babies after they're born shipping their spine is anything oh over and over you know this is this a real story or\nTrial that happened like in two thousand eight or something like that\nAnd nobody heard about it because the the media wouldn't cover it because it was it's politically sensitive if we're going to convict this guy of murder or what are we saying about abortion so people do the newspapers just wouldn't go to the trial\nAnd that part of the trial is in the movie is looking at the benches they thought it was going to be sensational trial a century because it was so such a big deal but ... and they had all these benches reserved for the press and no one showed up\nExcept for some like little punk rock chick with a block\nAnd she was covering the whole thing and she was and then she finally got the word out and then people came because it was just nuts and then some women died he neglected women on the ... you know ... and in places filthy is cats everywhere these turtles\nOr if the guy was just nuts and um so yeah ... ... G O s N E L L and no one's going to tell you about it was it a tough movie to watch yes I Would never I could not watch it again you know there's no gory parts there's not like you know when you see an abortion protester and they've shown shoving this\nHorrific picture in your face and I know it's not like that at all it's a trial uh and and it's fascinating\nBecause nobody cared and depressed wouldn't come and the guy or the the the detective\nPlayed by dean king Superman oh yeah the detective um\nHe was he was part of the drug like the the drug enforcement detectives local ones in Philadelphia and this doctor who's writing prescriptions Danny buddy the nurses are writing prescriptions all kinds of opioid kind of stuff\nAnd so he was investigating that and then he went in there and ... to find all the records of all those ... that the drug violations they're doing and then he said any any found a house of horse\nOpens up freezers and there's just like you know thirty or forty fifty sixty Seventy vials of\nLittle baby feet because the guy was weird and he saved the seat\nAnd put 'em in little formaldehyde things and then there was like you know too many fetuses he he did so many abortions you couldn't remember couldn't pay the bills to get rid of this medical what they would call waste I Would call it but maybe\nI'm ... and he was fighting he could he the babies were late term abortions they were already born so he couldn't get rid of them because the company that that it would ... that deals with that were like you know would would would tournament\nRight so that kinda stuff through the bags of babies and stuff like that Israel now it's real tough to watch I wouldn't see it again but I'm really glad I thought because it was it was interesting story it's a crime you know it's a crime is really\nYou know they got they got to solve this case and they got to put the evidence together and they and their um there\nAre up against a a tough spot ... so a gods now playing right now in a six hundred meters yeah\nThat's a big opening too it's pretty big opening\nI went to the anti premier in Beverly Hills\nYou been there Beverly Hills right and I have yet whether this line shows up like about five minutes before you actually have to make the turn I Love that\nYou know little heads up here it's coming up here comes your gut get ready for your buck or on and then you can make the turn ... yeah [laughter] I Need all that stuff that it's so important for me free parking anyway um what else did I see I saw\nUm [noise] oh you know they got us film struck I think I talked about that last week yeah at film stuff isn't it like okay what does that do Scott classical movies oh preschool sometimes when I'm writing I Want to go I got you know what I have to see cause I'm writing a western for very fancy produce\nI got to see every good western every famous iconic western there is\nAnd you try to find them and they're not on\nNetflix very few of them they're they're not on your cable you're dish movie think they're not on a Amazon although I think Amazon has the best selection of of old movies um they're hard to find mhm so you gotta like dig around on the Internet and get bad copies\nFilm struck has all the criterion collection the Turner classic movie collection and they got a lot of analysis guy introducing them\nA extras it's a ... a just a hundred bucks a year\nCouldn't be happier addicted to it this morning I was watching yesterday I was watching the postman rings twice ooh gray moved on them are never seen it but you hear about it all the time and never seen it monitored or is like ... times a thousand ... so ha can't take your eyes off\nWho knew so anyway that's about it for the movies right we come back we'll do the um story on them the super model and all that kind of stuff I\nSupermodel one [noise] and [noise] oh yeah Viacom suing Netflix we're talking about that say seven seven five to seven fifty eight seven Seventy five to eleven fifty barely legal radio program continues Truckee by legal ...

walks outside right obviously doesn't really care where he wouldn't go outside you wear a mask\nSo it's not really damaging to him\nCan you put that picture on a T shirt and sell it no why not use in a public place\nBecause then you are making money off of his likeness and you reduce\nThe it potentially hurt his ability to make money in his own T shirts but yeah it was on the shirts already controls his likeness he should be able to make money is on to your business and here you come along and ruin it so that's different now if you're just gonna posted\nYou're you're kind of a journalist when you posted on Facebook you say look I look I saw a subject that he looks great\nThat's the thing that no one ever says about celebrities they always you know I saw the president has officially check black in a terrible uh you know 'cause they're always wearing makeup when they see 'em on TV and then they see him in the grocery store and it's like oh ... oh my God the\nRat haggard yeah well that's why you don't want to be a celebrity yeah because everybody that sees you outside things you look terrible when you go through life where everybody UC says oh look rough\nWhen's the last time you saw me on TV oh I saw you five years ago from something was from five years before then you looked amazing\n[laughter] hey\nI had a makeup hair and everything ... outfits and now are you want me to look good\nTen years later with no makeup no hair doesn't seem right no it's not a great way to go through life but fortunately they make a lot of money sometimes it's like maybe buy their way to happiness so this lady get sued and you know of course she's mad\nAnd like you know she she posted something say you know most circumstances\nOkay yesterday I heard from my management that I'll just give her her I'll give you her her point of view\nGigi says yesterday I heard from my management and I and being legally pursued from my last Instagram post the photos by a paparazzi India's of me on the street outside an event last week I posed smile through the photo because I understand that this is part of my job\nThis isn't appropriate situation for the press to attend and also that this is help her out to make a living\nMost circumstances or not this way leaving my apartment or any time I feel that my privacy is being unreasonably intruded upon doing everyday legal things is harder to face these people make money off of us everyday legally stocking this day in and day out for nothing special for us to watch six feet\nThe car and six feet into a work building they drive dangerously close and extreme Lee recklessly they put the general public in danger in pursuit of a photo and now she stays inside most of the time because she doesn't want her photo taken and then she found this photo on Twitter\nNo attribution to the to whoever the photographer is already out there mhm she's saying you already made money for whoever outlet whatever I'll let you sold it to and put it in put it on the Internet and someone else took it and put it on Twitter she takes it puts it on and I was going to sue her\nSo it doesn't seem fair yeah\nHe lost control of it it's out there what are his damages you already got paid for it\nIf anything he's he's benefiting from it\nHe's already sold if that's true but we don't know you might have been trying to sell it and then someone got a copy of it and he's trying to track down and then you're she spreading it out to everybody now gosh you can't sell it at all but that's a tough um position celebrities Irene\n[noise] do you remember the monkey that took a picture\nAnd then they had a trial and see the monkey a who was going to on the copyright people were advocating for the monkey so that the monkey could on the copyright in the photo that the monkey took his the monkey stole the camera\nYou know because if you can go to like your broker places of monkeys and they will steal things from you you take your food do you take anything that you're holding right and they throw it around other monkeys like in the movie the jungle book so that classic case now\nSomeone someone he took it took a camera and then took a picture of the person so the camera the picture comes out the guy posted in someone else filed the lawsuit on behalf of the monkey sing that among them to copyright\n... that seems a little extreme what was the point of that\nWill tell you what it is it's dark there are people that try to keep the ... rights on animals\nSo that they will have the same rights as people\nAnd then they're like maybe that would be like an animal rights activists that wants to you know 'cause then ... then you can file a lawsuit on behalf of animals and and who are getting butchered for monkey burgers or um kangaroo burgers or whatever or beef burgers\nAnd then that would be like one step closer if they got a a legal case that that they gave a monkey or a a so they're coming after my burgers they're coming after you burgers I Can't have that right now so you have to eat we have to resist yes\nSo now there's if you go to my Facebook page barely legal radio with Joe was going to you will see a case\nWith some monkeys a bunch of monkeys in India through a bunch of bricks they got a bunch of bricks from a a ruin teachers I'm ruining India which breaks the gravel these bricks climate and the street and you start wailing them at some Seventy two year old man\nAnd they killed them you're kidding me\nNo I'm not so am I ... you don't look my Facebook page I guess not ever um yeah I just put it up there today it's ... it's a hot new story wow they killed them that's horrible so my question\nTo the uh\nThe general public wants monkeys to have to be able to own copyright ... should these monkeys face whatever India's capital punishment is for\nYeah of course they ... they should I mean what we put down like bears and we put down tigers when that they get out and kill somebody or I mean that's what that's what we do\nYou know Andy Warhol died in Nineteen eighty seven right there's a Nineteen eighty four so he's still alive doing these things with photos okay so he takes a photo and and you know doesn't what he does with ...

Goldsmith created art yeah her\nRight well if the rule is you know her lighting and all that kinda stuff\nAnd her angle um\nIf that's what's ... are protected by copyright\nThan he is he the ... and we're hose state of saying that's all been stripped away\nNow nothing left there was nothing left with the face and you can't copy right face this is their argument mhm this is all tree and this is going to go to trial right now so they they're they're saying it's all stripped away all there is this naked picture of\nPrinces face with no effects then he takes it and he put shadows on it he puts colors and he puts a little extra things on it he cut some stuff out um\nThat's and then it's an anti war all thing and suddenly it's worth a million dollars no one on Goldsmith took the picture and give it to Vanity Fair what was the worst\n[noise] what was it worth it I don't know seven hundred and fifty dollars Juno's than with five hundred dollars\nFor the let me ask you this question who were the idiots that are paying a million dollars was\nOr the guy who want to sell it next year for three million dollars and then buy a house across from where you live that says if you on the front [laughter] feel free [laughter] so um\nAnd it's a kind of the same thing that there's a lot of this is what um [noise] uh our good friend shepherd ferry does like that I Hope poster yeah you know\nThe um the Obama thing where he stripped down to nothing and it's just a picture like a million other pictures of ... million ... wherever that was ... she was being taken\nLike there was probably twenty other people taking the same exact photo in the same exact angle to same exact time so he didn't really ... has has ... did shepherd ferry hurt that guy's market\nFor I'm\nSelling that picture of Obama by doing his little poster that he did did he heard that guy's business yeah have you heard his ability to sell that photo that looked like every other photo and\nWarmer well I think how did that hurt his business I I\nI don't know there's no way in the world it he wouldn't even know that that was his\nPicture if he if he wasn't told [noise] and then this lingo Smith I think as it better argument because it's prince and she was set he sat there for a photo\nWith the guy that went after shepherd ferry I I don't think he had an argument at all\nAnyway so looking at Facebook and tell me what you think [noise]\nWe cannot engage in chaos we cannot engage in about race\nWe must reach fortified the Fort Campbell walls around reason and I know that if we're going to save the western way of life than we must go to the principles that the western way of life was founded on and that is a reason\nAnd logic and yes the teachings of Jesus Christ\nGlenn Beck arose morning is on the\nNews I'm Kathleen Maloney hurricane will is getting stronger and she takes aim at Mexico's Pacific coast\nIt is a category for hurricanes are dangerous hurricane maximum winds and you're a hundred and forty miles an hour or it's headed for the south western in West central portion of Mexico\nJohn ... the national Hurricane Center says the storm could make landfall by Tuesday the president of Mexico is ensuring safe passage to thousands of Central American migrants marching to the U.S Mexico border\nWe saw a riot police earlier today they back down we've seen maybe three five hundred cops here in the riot gear you didn't have buses and go away they have not stopped and they just overpower them with a number of people they don't want an incident\nFox is William ...
