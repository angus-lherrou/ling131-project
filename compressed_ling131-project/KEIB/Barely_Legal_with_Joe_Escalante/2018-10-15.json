Jim a Bradley no the singer ups the blind he you know what an interesting story he he died\nBefore his hit record was even released and it just became a hit and those sublime songs are just you know their masterpieces ... but he never got to to do we had a kid got married and then he uh he died\nTo tell you that right now so this lady's name aerial do mass I'm not going to make the obvious joke about a dumb ass name but aerial demolish whatever happens I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life she's a comedy writer\nSo good for comedy writers I'd say you know in Hollywood you're not going to suffer that much like so no one's going to say how dare you have an opinion you know cause in Hollywood seems to be okay to ruin that guy's life to them it seems to be worth it I'm not going to get into that right now but\nIt's a little volatile child she had to take it down and if I'm if I'm the executive producer of the cold air show I'd say hey look you know I hate that guy too but um you know don't make my job harder than it already is\nWho I I don't know I don't get it [noise] so anyway and then there again as I say there's always another side ruin that guy's life for what\nI mean he [laughter] if you think he represents something that harms women I accept that and I just try to tell celebrities an artist that are coming listening to show you gotta understand there are other people that think that guy is the best thing that ever happened\nTo women and for women and they just believe that maybe because he's a Catholic um maybe because he's you know if they look over his decisions and\nHe's\nThe same way as the other guy they wanted to put in your Ninety three Ninety seven\nOf the time but whenever there's women that that that can make a a deeply held argument based on a deeply held belief that that guy is the best thing ever happened to him and he might disagree with those people and that's that's awesome you disagree with them and you have your ... and they have there's but when you when you're\nTrying to sell soap on TV you know your ... your Philly for commercials\nAnd you're going to go after somebody like that that's that's a little vicious I don't I don't get it but I I if you want to hate him hate him great so many ways what would the comments on that one yeah of course there were a lot of comments like when a Kathy\nCorral said she didn't hear he was born in ... I guess maybe you um\n[noise] [noise] I guess she didn't run his life and this other one says remember when you read this is Rebecca Brunner remember when you read to kill a mocking bird and you learned that a woman's accusations should be investigated before man is lynched and then it was meant to reply\nTo that one and most of the people who are with her some people said the guys that jerk anyway some people that the guy from my\nUh kindergarten class of gotten a big fight political fight with somebody ah which\nYou know we could go to talk about posting political things on Facebook I

them was told by the manager and that the rest of the ban would be touring without him and he says none of his bandmates would return his calls to explain why so that's kind of like getting kicked out of the band he's suing Mick Fleetwood Stevie Nicks Christine ... and John Dixie\nAnd carrot top for some reason I don't understand that but\nHe's saying it should be paid the tour revenues if they're going to go on tour and they still got to pay him\nBecause he's ready and willing to towards the band and his lawyer is insisted that this has been a partnership ... they've always act as ... ... ... acted as if it's a partnership why the insisting on that because they have a new partnership agreement have known corporation the avenue and we'll see they haven't the articles of incorporation\nThey have new uh bylaws they have nothing so there's no contract\nAnd he wants to see when a breach of contract he's going to see one breach of if I Do share a duty to a partner and that's going to be is a holy grail and so he's got established through the partnership and it probably not that hard to do they're going to have to make some giant settlement to this guy if they don't want to\nPlay on stage of some kind of sad that he will go its own way [noise] oh yeah all those things are not going to end ladies and gentlemen [noise] ... with just a taste of the greatest song ever written
