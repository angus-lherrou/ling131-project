C. R. formula there's more green tea ... human the spiritual to be talked about\nFlash grape seed extract pine bark bio ... vitamin C. you talk to me about this array of really super anti accidents poli sci fi knows that you put in the form you\nWell yeah I won't say that we kind of went over killed but I Will say that we really really developed in the fish\nAnd comprehensive program here grape seed extract in pine bark extract both contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds\nSo let's break that down throughout the episode so what's the tools they do or what are the tools that you use that as right make that if a woman what\nI'm about to call you one minute before after I give you the disclaimer on guarantees whenever you we use the word guarantee on this show\nWe're always talking about the guarantees provided by the full faith credit and claims paying ability of the underlying insurance company exactly the same as your homeowner's insurance et cetera or any other thing that has an insurance company attached to it okay\nSo let's get right to this I ran the rates this morning before I came to the station\nAnd this is for fifty five year old right for fifty seven or sixty or sixty five the rates will be slightly different but these are the right so if you have a pen grab them and write it down or fifty five year old though would you prefer to hear the rates when a hundred thousand or a million two million okay so here you go\nFor an individual who's fifty five years old who has a million dollars in a four O. one IRA or even in an inherited account they've accumulated\nThat cash flow rate in ten years so in other words we're looking at dollars we can put in for just ten years the cash flow rate guaranteed contractually\nIs a hundred and fourteen thousand six hundred and eighty dollars okay so bear with me he was like I just wanna give you the the actual rate of return ... the cash flow rate is eleven point four percent\nSo I'm I'm fifty five I gave you a million dollars you don't give me give you truly I give the insurance company million dollar they hold on to it and ... ... for ten years uh-huh at sixty five I start getting paychecks that equal a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars a year for for as long as I live as\nLong as you have a pulse that's amazing that's right it's amazing but here's what's really amazing and for those who are you out there who have heard from your broker CPA\nGolfing buddy neighbor know it all at the gym who says I hate annuities I back cast is 'cause you're a member the fiduciary rule may be dead but it's not dead in my office I have to be able to prove\nWhat it takes to beat\nUsing traditional methods clear on that Phil yes All right\nWell let's take your million dollars and I also ran this in my system this morning and let's allow you to earn six percent every year we are pretty reasonable returned moving forward yeah six percent every year you pay one point in fees also reasonable\nYour million dollars will be worse than ten years\nOne one million excuse me six hundred and twenty eight thousand eight hundred and Ninety dollars your million dollars grew six hundred and eighty two thousand dollars but hey you know at that point in time remember you're now sixty five\nPerhaps you're getting ready to leave work or just supplement your cash flow you're going to be you're going to be held to the four percent rule\nWith me yeah [noise] so four percent of that total account which has grown to a million six eight six twenty eight is going to be sixty five thousand one hundred and sixty dollars\nOkay so what's dumbing down again remember we put in a million dollars in your brokerage account with X Y Z from\nYour grew the million you earn six percent you never lost a penny you never went back with none of that happened to you guy in ten years your million dollars you look when your brokerage statement is a million six hundred and twenty eight thousand eight hundred Ninety dollars [laughter]\nAnd you go tell your advisor okay I guess we'll stick to that four percent rule they say that's pretty safe so we're going to start with sixty five thousand one hundred and sixty dollars wow so wait a second what is the second where are you going to say\nI was gonna say so you're in New Jersey almost doubled that's right the the rain comes\nSo in my calculation which when you come in I Will put this on my big flat screen this is at risk income versus guaranteed income\nAnd yet it about it and that brokerage world is any of that data guaranteed of course not you may earned five you may earned twelve you may lose three may was twenty it's the complete crap shoot its Monte Carlo\nI Am not speculating for income\nIncome has to be guaranteed protected and lifelong got it okay now so far with this this is where ... people's minds especially you know for some reason the last three clients have been CPAs\nNow true confession it's taken longer to educate them because they have a lot of preconceived obviously financial data in their minds\nAnd unfortunately preconceived beliefs which are unfortunately is built just on bad market you know data that their preached by Wall Street so this one CPA who was super short be said to me so wait a second if I'm going to tie up a million dollars\nToday at fifty five Reddick cook and my brokerage account too I'm sixty five and all I can only spend sixty five thousand dollars and have a good chance of not letting my money\nI think I figure it out there for ... for me what I said what do you mean\nHe says well basically says I've been listening to your show for quite a while he says if I have an asset that can generate a cash flow rate of eleven point two percent assuming eleven points four percent guaranteed\nAnd I only meat sixty five thousand dollars\nIf I just take sixty five thousand dollars divided by eleven point for I only have to put five hundred and Seventy thousand in the new witty\nI get it I mean why wouldn't you put the ... million because he's in this hypothetical he goes I Want the sixty five thousand he doesn't need a hundred and fourteen I see so it's all in other words it's all tailored to income planning I get it okay\nI'm just showing you wait a second for basically forty five percent less dollars\nYeah the famous you having come back and is guaranteed exactly\nSo he goes okay so then when I showed him of course my tactical managers which is the other side of my practice as an investment advisor because so wait a second so in that million dollars he goes if I only have to put five hundred and Seventy thousand dollars\nNow I see I can have the other four hundred and Seventy go to the manager\nFor a hundred and thirty four new to me
