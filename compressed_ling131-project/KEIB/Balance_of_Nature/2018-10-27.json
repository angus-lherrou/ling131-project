graduate had to say\nI bar tended at a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas often maybe eight years I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different needed time I needed my life another student says\nAl ... and ... and that's something that I had always wanted to death\nAnd so as I die for that had a chemical or start that changed my life\nLearn more visitors on line that free O T a class on Tom that's free OT a class dot com\n[noise] you're listening to power trading radio [noise]\nWe'll come back and you're just shooting you Larry Jacobs director of a structure development and top instructor it on a train\nEconomy really shed some light on consistent returns in the market\nIt's one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency in the market\nSo many times I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow and in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we were talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you could even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income and I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call\nYou know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on\nWho are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this was a primary source of income that's a great\nQuestion right you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over forty and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officer we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny I got him Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that's whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you tie it back to the half day class you know they have to classes or three hours long and say if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by ... percentage so that you could have that financial freedom but Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish this I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month\nAnd that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why\n... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this and I want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing\nAnd part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build up the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel they could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be dropped as it could be their stocks but\nOne of the things about it is is we ... is one of the things you always talk about I guess I should say Larry is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about it like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income and it goes away well we're we're in her city right\nWe're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we've got a little bit of savings to buy us a little time but it ended up being that kind of that that that downward spiral or even just stuck in a rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nYour building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be ah not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability\nAt you know as a sitting here thinking what you're saying and you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing which really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh and I say this but with the frog\nIf you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you've covered the box a couple of times the frog hits the top lid and even if it's just that little way they still can't jumping the higher the where the lid was\nWe don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least thinking or just definition of of self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that aha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagine you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd now there are only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom and doing the things we want to do rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more of these passes what he say let's do it right now you have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income\nWhether that supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks doesn't matter it's all about generating more income\nAnd we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half day classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that great or warning that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these have take classes to get your phone's writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over included with your passes are professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top constructors\nLessons on topics like in ... strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly had to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you will have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else just telling you what you need\nAnd you're talking about the kind of the cycles with the markets go through the big ups in the big dams and we do generally have a crash about every and we call 'em crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that is if you go back and look at him how often they're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that\nAverage uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight new kind of measure that yet about fifty percent dropped Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing and so if we come to here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about uh we uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops in accounting and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nIt ... happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves instead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight\nIf you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit and then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now the flu bad at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the costs are we going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep their retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation\nOn just second you have a chance to win instead of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now ... through twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the\nNumber is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to stayed on the show as much as I can whether you have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nAt my desk off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you\nKnow ends up being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and nothing against that\nPoor people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people who investing all time highs and so think about it you're at an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you're investing your money and all of a sudden the market corrects will that correction is going to impact the first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into so now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher\nAnd it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further\nWhen the market goes down that dramatically like it didn't two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the forfeiture isn't housing dividend cuts devastating cuts so all these things\nHave a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and that is a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started\nEnded his multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get 'em out one of the half day classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to have to class going up in your area\nThat day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing make sure we have income for today income for tomorrow and really generating

point they were working right above it was out there they call it a buffet he he was going door to door buying stocks from people back in the day even as a kid\nI think I remember reading how he sold
