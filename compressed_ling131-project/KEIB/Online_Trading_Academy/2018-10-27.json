[noise]\nWe'll come back and if you're just shooting you just learn\nIt gives the director of a structure development and top instructor it online training academy really shed some light on consistent returns in the market\nIt's one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency in the market so many times I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the market's going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow and in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income and I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call\nYou know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys worked with students on\nWho are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is a primary source of income that's a great\nQuestion Ryan you know what I find that a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have ... fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to kick a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they lose their jobs if they even took a day or two off shore living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students and he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even at the half the class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you tie it back to the half the class you know they have to classes or three hours long and say if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by X percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with ... with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish it's like oh I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month\nAnd that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why ... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know you ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know at my kids do this and I want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing\nAnd part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build out the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel it could be through an active channel it can be through commodities that could be through options that could be through stocks but one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say Larry is is how multiple streams of income\nAre are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about it like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we got a little bit of savings to buy us little time but it ended up being that kind of that that that downward spiral or even just stuck in that rat race so to speak of well\nIf we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue your building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be ah not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability\nAt it you know as you're thinking what you're saying and you you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing which really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh when I say this but with the frog\nIf you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you've covered the box a couple of times the fraud hits the top lid and even if that little way they still can't jump in the higher the way the lid was\nWe don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least ... definition of of self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagine you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd not only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom and doing the things we wanted to rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more of these passes what do you say let's do it right now you have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income whether that's supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks doesn't matter it's all about generating more income\nAnd we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half their classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that great or warning that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these have to classes to get your phone's ready and if you're driving now is a great time to pull over including with your passes are professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we needed a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nThat if they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly what you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement\nYou can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you will have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else just telling you what you need\nYeah and you're talking about the kind of the cycles with the markets go through the big ups in the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that is if you go back and look at um how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you got about a fifty percent dropped Becky ... about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty St yep same thing\nAnd so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about uh we we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nAnd that drop happening I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now it's a little bit at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYep absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify\nWhere to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the costs are we going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing how do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could\nYou could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just second you have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your bones writing if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including ... year passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nTo professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now ... we need you to call now and\nReserve those seats the number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets at my desk off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know ends up being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and then nothing against that\nBut what people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs and so think about it you were at an all time high\nWeek after week that's investing your money and all of a sudden the market corrects well that correction is going to impact the first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into\nSo now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further\nWhen the market goes down that dramatically like it did in two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the forfeiture isn't housing dividend cuts devastating cuts so all these things\nHave a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and then a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started into this multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get 'em out one of the half day classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to have to class going up in your area\nThat day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing make sure we have income for today income for tomorrow and really generating and focusing on building out those multiple streams of income when the second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes doing these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluding with your

says\n... al ... and ... and that's something that I had always wanted to death and so if I die for it at a chemical or start that changed my life\nLearned more visit us on line that free O T a class on Tom that's free OT a class dot com\n[noise] you're listening to how we're trading wage [noise] we'll come\nBack if you're just sitting in his Larry Jacobs director of a stretch of development in having structure it online training academy really shed some light on making more income\nIn the market we've been talking a lot um a lot about generating more income whether its primary income\nWhether it's supplemental income whether it's passive income or whether it's active income and one of the things\nI always like to boil down in my classes Larry's everybody starts with ... with active income and then eventually moves into passive income even if you take the wealthiest people in the world right at one point they were working right above it was out there they call it a buffet and he was going door to door buying stocks from people back in the day even as a kid\nI think I remember reading how he sold bubblegum like on the on the beach at like his family vacations right as active income\nAnd right now that the common piece of active income that we all that we all generally have is is our job right we'd go out we have that job actively\nWorking to generate income well now we take a little bit about the money and we pay our bills and we put some food in our in our stomach and all of this fun stuff\nRight that we should have a little bit of money left over that goes into our retirement account now that retirement account really ends up being that first wave\nHave a lot slower turn times because\nThey I mean to give them a little bit of credit they don't have one hundred percent of their ships pushed all in in that direction like\nYou know they're spread thin between investments and you know just storing money and then also mortgages so it's kind of like they're part time mortgage people you know you want to go full time on that but you guys but you know ... you know you pay for what you get so you know if you want to go local if you want to be able to get a coffee handed to you but you're going to pay twenty thirty forty thousand dollars difference\nI mean we gave me the numbers and we did Cincinnati we did Houston we did San Francisco we told you guys the difference between shop and I'm only going direct I don't want to pay lender fees\nI don't want to take a higher interest rate that I'm going to have for the long haul a lot of these people that lock today they might never refinance again Theresa have rates go where people were saying this might be the last refinance that they got to deal with so another thing is is

hadn't had a Christmas often maybe eight years and I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different I needed my time I needed my life\nAnother student says ... you can find happening at a career and training that's something that I had always wanted to death and sell as I'd I'd die for that had a chemical or start that changed my life\nLearn more visitors on line that free O T a class on Tom that's free OT a class dot com\n[noise] you're listening to power trading radio [noise]\n\nWe'll come back and you're just shooting you Larry Jacobs director of a structure development and top instructor it on a train\nEconomy really shed some light on consistent returns in the market it's one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency in the market so many times I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating\nYeah and that ends up being the key really in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time\nTalking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys worked with students on\nWho are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is a primary source of income that's a great question\nRyan you know what I find that a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have ... the thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I'd mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to kick a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two off shore living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny I got him Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even at the half the class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you tie it back to the half the class you know they have to classes or three hours long and say if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by ... percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish this I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month\nAnd that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why ... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know you ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing and\nPart of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build up the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel it could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be dropped as it could be their stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say Larry is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income and it goes away well we're we're in her city\nWe're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we got a little bit of savings to buy as little time but it ended up being that kind of that that that downward spiral or even just stuck in a rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nYour building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be ah not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability at you know as a sitting\nHere thinking what you're saying and you you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing which really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh when I say this but with the frog\nIf you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you covered the box ... a couple of times the frog hits the top lid and even if it just that little way they still can't jumping the higher the where the lid was\nWe don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least thinking or just definition of of self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagined you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd not only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom and doing the things we wanted to rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more of these passes what are you say let's do it right now you have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income\nWhether that's supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks doesn't matter it's all about generating more income\nAnd we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half day classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that grade or ward and that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these have take classes to get your phone's writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over including with your passes are professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your time or a strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional inside of kit makes it so you can get started right now\n... through twenty we needed a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teachers students read out of the gate that they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly what you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this\nFirst have to figure out what your needs are learn how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management how to protect that money and then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else just telling you what you need\nYeah and you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big ups and the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at um how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you\nKind of measure that you got about a fifty percent dropped Becky ... about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing and so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about ah we we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand and that happened in one year\nAnd that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself\nFool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves instead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight\nIf you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit and then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now to leave it at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify\nWhere to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the costs are we going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation well just second you have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including ... year passes is going to be our professional

us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you could scores and passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars of that day classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as\nHaving our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money you know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat my dentist offices of kids shut up to a doctor are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know ends up being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and then nothing against that\nBut what people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs and so think about it you're in an all time high\nWeek after week actually investing your money and all of a sudden the market corrects well that correction is going to impact\nThe first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into so now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times faster than it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further when the market goes down that dramatically like it did in two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the forfeiture as in housing dividend cuts dividend cuts so all these things\nHave a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and then a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started ended his multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the half day classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to have to class

life\nLearn more visitors on line that free O T a class dot com that's free OT a class dot com\n[noise] you're listening to power trading radio [noise]\nWelcome back\nIf you're just sitting in his Larry Jacobs director of instructed development and having structure it online training academy really shed some light on making more income\nIn the market we've been talking a lot a lot about generating more income whether its primary income\nWhether it's supplemental income whether it's passive income or whether it's active income and one of the things\nI always like to boil down in my classes Larry's everybody starts with ... with active income and then eventually moves into passive income even if you take the wealthiest people in the world right at one point they were working right above it was out there they call it a buffet he he was going door to door buying stocks or people back in the day even as a kid\nI think I remember reading how he sold bubblegum like on the on the beach at like his family vacations right that's active income\nAnd right now that the common piece of active income that we all that we all generally have is is our job right we'd go out we have that job actively\nWorking to generate income well now we take a little bit about money and we pay our bills and we put some food in our in our stomach and all this fun stuff right and then we should have a little bit of money left over that goes into our retirement account now that retirement account really ends up being that first wave\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat they ... exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really taken truly a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life that drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's writing if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluding with your passage is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always liked to say and I said earlier on the shows doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\n... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have you have bags in bags loads of these these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here\nIs that with trading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right 'cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave of the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard\nAnd she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it people go on vacation Ryan right and they trade the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nWe're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know are we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kind of fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduce you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half the class and we are\nPretty much at the end of the show but before we end where you say we do another giveaway\nYeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here\nAh right right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find a how how is out at the half the class now just a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your bones writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is our professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like at hand senior retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the\nProfessional insider kit makes it so you can get started right now ... when he did a call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there Larry thanks for joining me always great\nHere Ryan hopefully some people out there are going to take up ... up on this and a change there\nTo the to become solid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society in a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last six years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've sponsored a program that's called a sponsor a child [laughter]\nAnd ah so we want to raise money for that and last weekend we had the gala at a ... in in Plano in North Dallas and uh\nWe raised over a three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is\nIt is really really something it's amazing how you know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven um\nYou know are we we have as I mentioned they sell strategy or we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have a cell strategy and is because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life you've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it\nAnd so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve that we have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells of philosophy we have certain criteria that\nSays it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven\nAnd what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens is that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to your cell signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right\nYou know you don't like being wrong obviously a and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand eleven our strategy said to sell both of those were very very near to bury markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and where and\nAnd so technically those were you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent in two thousand eleven so that's not too bad the ... the U.S and pick 'em\nBut be that as it may\nThose two which we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out and are those turned out to be near misses or they were close to a bear market but they weren't\nAnd the market rebounded quickly after that but in in uh in November of two thousand seven\nWhen that one came I was like oh no I Hope we don't you know I didn't want to sell because it felt like the economy was generally okay it felt like things were generally okay there was a lot of bad news everywhere you know it was the news wasn't great but it wasn't terrible\nAnd so I wasn't very feeling now I don't want to you know but of course we did and we we follow or discipline up and then the same thing is how I feel now\nYou know you look at it we just got GDP numbers that looked pretty good you've got a you know the consumers and this and that and generally the the all the indicators tell you things are are looking good right now\nBut yet our indicators telling us that we are close to getting ready to sell and I don't want to sell when things are looking good you know I don't want to be wrong but what's interesting is that that's how I felt to two thousand seven and of course so maybe I have a contrary indicator when I think it's right and wrong and what I think it's wrong them right\nOr it's right anyway whatever\nPoint being ladies and gentlemen is that if you are retired or retiring soon do you even have a strategy to protect yourself from the next market crash what if this is a market crash what if we're about to go into a trade war with China which I think we are now I changed my mind I think we're going there\nAnd if that happens we can see the market go

we\nAre actresses money matters when can rape and of course I Am your host can re\n[noise]\nJak and this is the bonanza the airwaves we share with you the golden nugget of financial information and uh every week and I\nYou're faithful host ... had been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these are the very same idea that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients\nAnd we are a affirmed money matters that special we we specialize in a retirement planning so we work with people primarily or over fifty retired are retiring soon and if that is you we want to work with you as well and the show is designed for you\nAnd I recently barons of Barron's Magazine named walk your paypal host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors for the seventh year in a row yeah wow is right I'm very impressed by that but you know what\nWithout our clients we would be absolutely nowhere so I I give it to them I don't I don't take any credit for that now since we are a firm that does that specializes in a retirement planning [noise] um we we all this you know\nIt's a different philosophy\nBeing a financial advisor to somebody who is about to retire or is already retired than it is if you are talking to somebody who's in their twenties or thirties\nIt's just different when you're in your twenties and thirties you're on off once you're growing your money you're being aggressive you know you can be more aggressive you've got more time I'm chances are you're not going to be living on that money for a long time so you don't have to take into account withdrawals from the get from your money so you can be more aggressive you can take a little bit more risk\nAnd in the long run if should pay off for you but\nThat isn't the case once you get\nWithin five years of retirement or five years after retirement in my opinion I think at that point you have to start thinking about preserving and keeping what you have\nAnd so I think there is no doubt and so risk number eight of the uh Eighteen risks that are the important risk that you face during retirement is market risk and this last a\nAnd in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers\nAnd uh that's the thing we're proud of but without our clients we boards probably wouldn't even have noticed we were on the map so thank you all your clients that are listening to the show and those of you who are not yeah there you go as well kiss\nFor those of you are not clients or if you're over fifty if you're retired or retiring soon\nI invite you to go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net and\nWhen you were there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so do their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff\nWell this is the second to the show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that so here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nRefrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still\nDelayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent\nSo if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security of journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase so the question is if I enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nBut I don't collect so screwed I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits the answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not the other way around okay if you file for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part a All right so a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and is eighty years old and he applied for retroactive\nBenefits okay so you never applied you waited fifth in this case twenty Fifteen Years okay so if he applies now well his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get six months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth and it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know\nYou think about six months that age eighty um with all the delayed credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for you okay so can apply as can a person born in Nineteen fifty to repay his Social Security benefits to ... or received to date and then re file to obtain a higher current pay out\nOkay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so but uh I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter]\nThat's good so here's the answer if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and re file okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file essay form five Twenty one\nSo so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they paid you and then re filed later alright\nSo uh that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question [noise]\nOr whatever you had this talk with Tom I Am too so um as I mentioned we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that ah that requires we want to help you

so once you retire you want to get income from your investments where'd you get it from that kind of stuff\nOr we want to talk about should you roll over your four one K. um when should you take Social Security when you're sixty two when you're sixty six when you're Seventy when's the best time to do that we want to talk about the fact that the IRS\n[noise]\nMan she's afraid of that I arrest guy [laughter] I Can't blame her ah the IRS once the tax eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits did you know that eighty five percent\nSo we want to [noise] I agree and you know what we want to show you how to beat that if it is\nA tall possible we want to talk about diversification or how much risk should you take with your portfolio we have a way of calculating that we call at your
