with us all kinds of stories here's one one recent graduate had to say\nI bar tended at a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas often maybe eight years I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different I needed my time I needed my life\nAnother

visit us on line that free oh TA class down Tom that's free OT a class dot com\n[noise] you're listening to how we're trading radio [noise]\nWe'll come back and if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs director of a structure development and top instructor it on a train\nEconomy really shed some light on consistent returns in the market\nIt's one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency in the market\nSo many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little bit\nThere's no income and and you can even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on\nWho are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this was a primary source of income is a great\nQuestion ride you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over four hundred and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to kick a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officer we're living in this constant\nStream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money it's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you tie it back to the half day class you know they have to classes or three hours long and say if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by X percentage so that you could have that financial freedom but Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish and so I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month\nAnd that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why\n... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this and I want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing\nAnd part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build up the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel it could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be dropped as it could be their stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say Larry is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about it like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we've got a little bit of savings to buy us a little time but it ended up being that kind of\nThat that that downward spiral or even just stuck in a rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nYour building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be ah not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability\nAt it you know as a sitting here thinking what you're saying and you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing which really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh when I say this but with the frog\nIf you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you cover the box a couple of times the frog hits the top lid and even if it's just that little way they still can't jump in the higher the where the lid was\nWe don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least thinking or just definition of of self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagine you couldn't make any more money you talk yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd now there are only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom and doing the things we wanted to rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more of these passes what he say let's do it right now you have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income whether that supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks doesn't matter it's all about generating more income\nAnd we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half their classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that grade or warning that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of pass as one of these have to classes to get your phone's writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes are professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhanced in your time a strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currencies and much much more\nSo we start to teachers students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else just telling you what you need\nYou you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big ups in the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at him how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that yet about fifty percent dropped Becky ... about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing and so if we come to here and we say OK here's\nHere that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal but the thing that I went through with my father about uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight or you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account and they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nAnd that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now to leave it at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYep absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the cost of ... going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old\nKnow when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just a second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including ... year passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nTo professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... we need you to call now and reserve those seats the\nNumber is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you could scores and passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars would that be classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nAt my desk soft as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know ends up being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and then nothing against that\nBut what people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs and so think about it you're at an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you're investing your money and all of a sudden the market corrects will that correction is going to impact\nThe first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into so now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times faster than it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further\nWhen the market goes down that dramatically like it did in two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the forfeiture isn't housing dividend cuts devastating cuts so all these things\nHave a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and then a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started ended his multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the half day classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to have to class got up in your area that they classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing\nMake sure we have income for today income for tomorrow and really generating and focusing on building out those multiple streams of income when the second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of pastors doing these half day classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull

classes Larry's everybody starts with ... with active\nIncome and then eventually moves into passive income even if you take\nWell these people in the world right at one point they were working right above it was out there they call it a buffet and he was going door to door buying stocks for people back in the day even as a kid I think I remember reading how he sold bubblegum like on the on the

com\n[noise] you're listening to power trading wage [noise]\nWe'll come back and you're just shooting in their Jacobs director of a structure development and top instructor it on a train\nEconomy really shed some light on consistent returns in the market\nSo one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency in the market\nSo many times I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we were talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on\nWho are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this was a primary source of income that's a great\nQuestion ride you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over forty and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to kick a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two off shore living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you tie it back to the half day class you know they have to classes or three hours long and say if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by ... percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish this I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month\nAnd that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why\n... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this and or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing\nAnd part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build up the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel they could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be dropped as it could be their stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say there is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we've got a little bit of savings to buy us a little time but it ended up being that kind of\nThat that that downward spiral or even just stuck in a rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nYour building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be a better not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability\nAt it you know as a sitting here thinking what you're saying and you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing which really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh and I say this but with the frog\nIf you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you've covered the box ... a couple of times the frog hits the top lid and even if it's just that little way they still can't jumping the higher the way the lid was\nWe don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least thinking or just definition of of self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagine you couldn't make any more money you talk yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd now there are only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom and doing the things we want to do rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more of these passes what he say let's do it right now you have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income\nWhether that supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks doesn't matter it's all about generating more income\nAnd we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half day classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that great or warden that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these have take classes to get your phone's writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over including with your passes are professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top constructors\nLessons on topics like in ... strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currencies and much much more\nThe professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we needed a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you will have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else just telling you what you need\nYou you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big ups and the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at him how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so\nKind of an average of that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that yet about a fifty percent dropped Becky ... about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing and so if we company here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about uh we uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops in accounting and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand and that happened in one year\nIt ... happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan they don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now a flu bad at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the cost of ... exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could\nYou could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just a second you have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... we need you to call now and\nReserved those seats the number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to stayed on the show as much as I can whether you have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat might does off as a kid shut up to a doctor are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know ends up being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and then nothing against that\nPoor people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs and so think about it you were at an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you're investing your money and all of a sudden the market corrects will that corruption is going to impact the first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into so now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher\nAnd it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth and that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further\nWhen the market goes down that dramatically like it didn't two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the forfeiture as in housing dividend cuts in cuts so all these things\nHave a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and that is a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started into this multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the half day classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to have their class going up in your area\nThat day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to really keep that retirement account growing make sure we have income for today income for tomorrow and really generating and focusing on building out those multiple streams of income

going to be our professional insiders kid now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the

maybe eight years and I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different of needed my time I needed my life\nAnother

more visitors on line that free O T a class on Tom that's free OT a class dot com\n[noise] you're listening to power trading radio [noise] welcome back\nIf you're just sitting here is Larry Jacobs director of a stretch of development as having structure it online training academy really shed some light on making more income\nIn the market we've been talking a lot um a lot about generating more income whether its primary income\nWhether it's supplemental income whether it's passive income or whether it's active income and one of the things\nI always like to boil down in my classes Larry's everybody starts with ... with active income and then eventually moves into passive income even if you take the wealthiest people in the world right at one point they were working right above it was out there they called a buffet and he was going door to door buying stocks for people back in the day even as a kid\nI think I remember reading how he sold bubblegum like ... on the on the beach at like his family vacations right as active income\nAnd right now that the common piece of active income that we all that we all generally have is is our job right we'd go out we have that job actively\nWho runs to the moon\nFlashy slung used over your\nLast one who won the father\nCountry yes they did on this ... than\nWe are wallowing in champagne this is money matters with Ken rape but of course I Am your host Kendall\nRight [noise]\nYou Jack I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and we're not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states doing\nToday on beyond and you know what buses right we want to help more people do their retirement planning than anyone else that is our goal and uh so um because of that and we primarily work with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or who are retiring soon and if that as you then we would love to meet you and work with you\nAnd a ... a recently named the more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors now for the seven year in a row\nAnd without our clients I Would be no aware and so I put that one on them I give it to my clients well this is a part of the show where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor now this week we're actually going to talk about paying for college\nAnd the gift tax laws so if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you give anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year\nOkay and so that's the gift tax and college in many cases more than fifty thousand dollars a year I Know I have one in college right now and so you could end up having to do a gift tax\nIf you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak and you know I Do\n\nWhat do you say you\nDog and may be em\nEm\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite it's designed it take you from riches to rags\nAnd we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education paying for that okay so as I mentioned the gift tax exemption\nA is a Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS [laughter]\nAh almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS\nCame up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon your death and it goes to whoever a man they want it attacks that so they created the estate tax but the IRS is a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax that happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to get it all away first and then when they died as no tax so we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid so they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we are going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that\nBut they also realized that if you tax every single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with this with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so we get kind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax\nExemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars per person that you can get to and as a married couple you can give thirty thousand dollars to as many people as us so the gift tax\nExempt amount that Fifteen thousand as you can get that too many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax\nAnd then by the way if you exceed that Fifteen thousand a gift tax is the same as your state tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay gift taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then have them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have it goes through the child then that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore it doesn't count\nSo my advice to you is don't give the child the money now I'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college I'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott\nAnd his parents were giving him the money\nTo sensibly pay for the tuition guess what Scott was doing\nHe wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping the money and he used to come down every day and like he had this Chinese ...\nYou know this this sat in ... and he'd come down in that and he looked like and slept all night he'd wake up in time to watch the gong show remembers that buried the was that guys they bury something who did the gong show\nHe would wake up in time to watch the show on television and then you know he'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money\nSo if you needed another reason not to get your child the tuition money it's that [laughter] anyway\nAs I mentioned we are from that uh we uh we special we specialize in retirement planning that's what we do so we we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon and so that is you then we want to work with you and so if you go to our website it

busy at the top of the show this ever strong formula does so much for us we have an even\nTouched on the incredible brain benefits I mean some of these studies you sent me are absolutely incredible as you know I'm very into neutral picks the anti aging community has taken a keen interest in Korea teen\nSpecifically the cognitive benefits of Korea Team\nOh absolutely this is one of those areas where Korea Team really shine you see what we need to understand is that your brain even though it's only two percent of your body's weight it utilizes twenty percent\nOf your body's energy this is a very thirsty Oregon for energy and just like your muscles soak up decree it seemed like a sponge\nBecause this is a naturally occurring molecule in the body it passes right through the blood brain barrier your brain or an soak it up like a sponge and it increases your Korea teen phosphate reserves in your brain so now in your brain you have more readily available resources to do was to recharge\nThose neuronal batteries to make more energy inside the brain so basically what do you notice well your memory is supported and pat scientists have done some amazing research here they found the people that take Korea Team it supports their memory it actually helps the brain to utilize\nOxygen better it supports memory and people that are sleep deprived it's been shown to help people add numbers quicker and for longer periods of time without mental fatigue get this study pat just five days five days of eight grams of creativity and supported mental tasks in subjects that we're getting\nRapid fire question scientists were asking him math questions in science questions over and over and over and they found the folks aren't creating didn't fatigue as quickly\nMentally so this is amazing stuff it's like a turbo booster for your brain it's like a super charger for your muscles are re chargers all your cellular battery so all of your cells tissues and organs have more readily available energy\nOr dark I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps in the gym maybe get some extra power and their workouts but you're also saying there's a big push a nutritional community to encourage people in their forties fifties sixties seventies and even eighties to leverage the power of Korea Team to stay fit strong and healthy like you say\nKorea Tina's going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she goes to novelist does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out creating helps to do that\nAnd then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that\nBut even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before is that her medical doctor recommended routine for and that just goes to show\nHow much more mainstream this is it's called ever strong and it supports the muscles to support your power your strength your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it\nBut even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool\n'cause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nBeen exercised so I'm quoting here Korea ten\nSupplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular string\nPower and insurance increase lean body mass\nFor those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly they go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finish with this creating supplementation without training in the elderly potentially delay atrophy of muscle\nAnd and proven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line ... is very very effective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health\nAnd on top of that it supports your bone health I mean ... when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right now you're a person that never heard about

any diseases below welcome once again to help my brother's\nOn your host mark Simone so glad you could join us today it's a power pack program\nIn fact our story originally Fifteen Years ago when there were no TV shows ... minutes captivated audiences around North America with a special segment of the French paradox you remember the French paradox this is the counterintuitive concept that says\nRed wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight\nOr energy healthy aging you needed longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find\nOut of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was beer its role yes ... all the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nNow our guest today is that just has\nThe story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce rubber Twenty years Dr precedent as an institution in New York radio hosting his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a longtime product formulated and high level advisor for purity products that your husband welcome aboard\nMark always great speaking to you\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's touch them this is talk of the nominal those people out there who just vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was very ... and why is it all over the news today well first\nOf all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News you know I read about twenty health journals a weekend every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically resveratrol is what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine that's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even found and peanuts\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd the scientists really first became interested in resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when raspberries role was first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish\nWell anything that extends the life of anything is going to pick the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well\nBy two thousand six Patty and scientists discovered that resveratrol extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and an even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand sex\nAnd here's what really got them interested Harvard researcher David Sinclair reported that resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice by thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seem to protect the intestines and the colon it definitely supported normal and some attic activity in the body it improved indoor ends\nThere was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology and France that showed that it dramatically improved indoor and storing aerobic activity\nAnd it even proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school in New York I was just reading at an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived threat like not eating enough caloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they called the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a secular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the K\nAccording to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard no this is important the\nMost potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with Judy products for several years of their co Q. formulas but now they speak to your co enzyme Q. too which is just as important as reservists role especially for your heart health and you'll says in some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs co Q. ten ... what exactly is good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak or what a co enzyme is\nA co enzyme is any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects\nWell co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart your liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy\nWow that's amazing\nWell that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful anti oxen and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that while ago well I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point and this is Nineteen sixty three\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heartbeat they were literally looking at heart and saying what is making this darn thing beat well they found out that was co Q. ten\nAnd that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell when's himself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten\nSo we could say it's so darn important because your energy is related to the amount of co Q. ten and your body and without an adequate supply of co Q. ten\nYou're living in what we call an energy deficient stay your heart and he's co Q. ten in fact the highest concentration of co Q. ten in your body is right in your heart muscle\nYour brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system it's applies energy to your lungs to your liver\nSo needless to say we all of this energy\nThat case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty you got left and\nFifty percent of the co Q. ten in your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential I mean you could eat sardines and mackerel and peanuts\nOr co Q. ten comes from but it's not going to be enough just from your diet well\nDr person I understand that you told purity after quite a bit of research that it was time to combine these two ingredients to cook you ten and the reserve troll now why he's proud of this cutting edge combinations purity cause it they're cute super boost formula what can it actually do people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called it the advantage I like that so I adopted the term it's combining to amazing nutrients under themselves which a spectacular but when you combine them indeed this that I had\nTo learn this if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage the cardiovascular benefits benefits to your brain function and cognitive performance\nIt even is involved in healthy aging and it's important for supporting immune function it's great for your skin it's great for energy and insurance and aerobic capacity and as we said before\nIt supports normal and it's a matter of activity throughout your body\nAnd I think this is the ultimate combination not remember mark as we said the energy in your body is converted by co Q. ten add to that the benefits of resveratrol this combination it is on the boat and indeed you get as my students said this real advantage\nBut it's interesting we're talking with Dr Alan ... know that your presents tell me more about the consequences of being co Q. ten deficient\nYeah well that's really interesting you know one of the assignments I gave my class awhile ago was to create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire in other words if\nYou're going to give a patient a questionnaire to determine\nWhether or not they had a co Q. ten deficiency what questions would be on the questionnaire well the first thing everybody agreed on and class was a feeling of being run down feeling for tea you know I hear I'm running out of gas I got an energy crunch my batteries are a lot you know like that\nSo basically a lack of energy a lack of stamina and remember we need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is that Cain nutrient involved in energy production", "show_name": "Online Trading Academy", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "28"}
