things become big things\nAnd so you can look at it you can look at things where you say okay well well what if I could generate a little more income and what if it was five dollars a day right now at five dollars they turn into ten dollars a day could turn into twenty dollars and it started with that five dollars a day and next thing you know a few years from now or maybe five years from now it's five hundred dollars a day right but it had\nTo have a starting point it goes back to some of the phone calls you always throw in like the ... and stuff like that where I I and I might messed this up so if I Do correct me with a on it but it's if you don't have to be great to get started but you have to get started to be great right there there's all sorts of fun things like that\nThat are out there that are that are will call cliche but they're also so true right there is so true and they're they're they're they're necessary for us to say they're necessary for us to hear but then they're also\nNecessary for us to take action on if we want to generate that extra income because that's really what ends up failing in our New Year's resolutions as we say okay well I Want to make more money I Want to lose weight well there's there is a step by step process to both of those\nAnd at the end of the year the reason why maybe we didn't make more money or we didn't lose weight the reason we didn't is staring back at us in the mirror rant and really we've got to own that we've got to say okay I'm not going to let anything be my optical and especially that person in the mirror is not going to be my ... obstacle which just simply means usually changing similar habits and changing what we're doing is not a complete life overhaul\nBut it's just adding a few more pieces in that can help it generates more income and to have to class really spend a lot of time going through some of these step by step process is that can help generate more income before you to see those you're going to need to you're going to need to have tickets so they'll let you in the one of the things we could do or if you're up for it as we give away somewhere ticket let's do it\nAll right well right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area\nThat have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to start generating multiple streams of income\nIncome through stock options futures currencies right multiple streams of income\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these classes so if you are driving now's the time to pull over and get that phone ready included with your past this is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional inside her kid makes it so you can get started right now\n... century Twenty one you just call now reserved those seats the number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you could scores and passes there\nThe the multiple streams of income topic is one that I Love ...\nHow how you can really approached the financial markets you really can't pick out commodities you could separate commodities you can separate options you can separate currencies you could separate separate aid evidence strategy and very very quickly you could build out four to five six even seven\nDifferent types different streams of income\nFrom the different financial markets that we have out there and we haven't even touched on real estate or owning another business or different things like that that can be passive as well but right here in the financial markets where all you really need is an Internet connection we have the opportunity or we have the the access of generating these multiple streams of water some of the what are some of the multiple streams what are some of the secondary streams are some of the passive type\nUh types of income that you see a lot of the students focusing on that are really helping them reach their financial freedom\nGulf well before I jump into that let's take a look again about just getting a second job people think by simply addicts some zeroes at the end of their income\nThey're simply going to be out of debt where most of the time they don't get educated enough and they're adding more zeroes the end of their expenses\nSo one of the ways you can look at this as as you mentioned are students realized that they can be trading and this is really about them so if you're listening it's about you what are your goals right now what are you trying to attain\nBut when you're averaging your price back up by these all time highs offsets all the money that was invested in that for all and came back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with us which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK right we just have to know that\nA Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer as the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got a kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as there he says okay let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area they have to classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement growing whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and\nMore income for tomorrow and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these have to classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional inside of it makes it so you get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight\nSeven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nYou know we've talked a lot about kind of the growing side of things with their retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we've got we have a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where your risk reward rely so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that I told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and then you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight fact I speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction\nAt some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back and it's almost like you have the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what they have in their retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your saved retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you\nSwitch you have to start doing right now is thinking well if I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income enables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compound annually\nYou can start thinking about generating the money you need to retire the right way and again\nThis comes down to getting yourselves educated\nWhat I said before earlier is that most people make the greatest mistake possible try to wing it on their own by reading books are watching Youtube videos and you'll see right right I I'm not going to go on line learn how to fly a plane from a Youtube video and then go up to it fly school and go watch Youtube video can I get in the cockpit right now and take off\nDoesn't make any sense well the same thing can be said about your money as as I Love from the movie the pursuit of happiness Chris gardener mother played portrayed by Will Smith once said the cavalry ain't come and you have to care more about your money than anybody else and that means protecting yourself by getting yourself educated as quickly as possible\nWhenever you whenever you bring up a the pursuit of happiness and you say the ... coming it always reminds me of another quote a and I don't know where it originated from but our our our friend Kelly would always say over and over she'd always say this life is not a dress rehearsal\nAnd over I've heard her say that a million times I don't remember where she got it from the will give credit for that one right now now one of the things about the fees that you were touching on that I just want to elaborate on before we jump into this break as it is you're talking about thirty percent can end up going to fees and there was an article I saw a little while ago that shows how the average person spends three years of their life\nPaying for the fees so if you make fifty thousand dollars a year you can expect to be about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you can expect to pay about three hundred thousand dollars\nIn fees one of the things you can do to avoid those fees is really take control of your of your money before you should do that you need to know how to do it\nWhat great place to start that to start that educational process is that one of our half the class and we just happen to have a stack of tickets here Larry are you ready I'm ready All right well right now I've got a half the class coming up in your area and a half the class as we can see exactly what it takes really take control those retirements generate that income for today and make

that you too can generate income just like the wall street does\nAnd it happens every day people are making money every day in these markets and the other day I was teaching a class and I had a student logged in and his name was ... Nathaniel ... and I and I believe he was from Montana somewhere I I I I uh I'm not quite sure I was on line so it was we were chatting though the the thing that that he brought up as he said you know only about twenty percent of the time\nA meaning the nine thousand order sitting there that they know they can't build anywhere near that amount of cars they plan\nTo ... thousand Fifteen hundred\nThat their actual plan was more than that are between the challenger and the charger I think the number they thought they would that would be able to sell was between three and four thousand\nAnd in some twenty two hundred and nine thousand orders that now that part of that study or salt\nA dealers in some parts of the country of just continue to take orders for the scars knowing that they were not going to be able to produce those cars why would you do that or you know selfish you want to take the guy out of the market on the off chance you do you you are able to get your hands on\nA but you know when you're talking those kind of numbers some dealers won't get any of these cars now I'm hoping I've had the challenge or you can see that review car for us I dot com under a reviews\nBut I've had the challenger hoping to have the charger next week uh there's there's a a slim chance at a company that administers the fleet press cars for [noise] a lot of the manufacturers it's got to they've got an office in Dallas there's a chance that they're going to get in a\nA hell cat challenge or or sorry charger over the weekend\nIf so then I'll get it Monday morning and I'll do two cars next week because I Know for sure I have the twenty sixteen my very first twenty sixteen miles to six grand touring which I'm so much looking forward to that such a pretty car and you know it's a shame because\nYou get sucked in it and when we got a caller on the line and I got second to try to give them the best advice as I possibly can and they want that midsized car unity out your mind always go to camp court fusion uh\nAnd really my mind should go to ... ... at the same time so it's kind of like out of sight out of out of mind I don't get the opportunity to drive nearly so many miles just as I Would like to\nSo I'm hoping that this one will be everything I think it's going to be I'm hoping I like it as well as I Do the Volkswagen Golf are that are driving this week\nI

twenty fourteen cameras out there if you've got an auto trader dot com you can look at all of them in in one fell swoop\nAnd just see what the market is but let me let me warn you bury tall changed dealers are not jacking their prices up on line anymore they know they know better than to do that if they're out there and they've got a high price on a car they're not going to get any players on it because it's too easy to shop online\nSo you know a lot of dealers you see the price on line they can't move at all there at the best price they can be right off the bat other dealers price up some\nAnd then they reduced the prize as they go along so you're not going to find a real bad deal on line but I'll tell you this art dealer are Toyota dealer in Houston\nIs the largest free owns certified Toyota dealer in the country\nAnd that is totally out of Katy\nUh they keep between four and five hundred a certified Toyotas on the ground at all times asked for micro Hartman the general

O. B. J. and David go\nHey Jerry ... a great man with a\nWell I'm getting ready to fly at all it's a um\nAnd I've heard before about how nice do you like quiet and comfort and that's that's I don't know what I'm looking for\nMy price range I'd look at it like a super forest or a on a A R e or that it's on road or whatever else you might get a primary\nFocus is that price range as tougher quiet yeah ...\nWhat what kind of price range are you trying to stay in David\nWell I'm a little hard to load it tore up coming out of LA yes I Want a night but uh when I go up the verse eighties and allergy in this hot yeah\nSo a touring the RV like everything in it and you know just the Arab or thirty\nYeah that sounds right I'm In and I like to see RV they've made some nice changes in it or the past few years\nUm in quality wise if you're going to try to keep it and get two hundred plus thousand miles that it was probably as good a choice as there is a for quietness and ride I actually prefer the escape a little bit not a better for as I've said a million times for dessert a great job with\nInterior quietness and ... it's hard to beat it's got a lot of the the same features that you'd find on the sea every blind spot monitoring electric tailgate great blue to system\nA nice stereo a and it's going to run you a loaded titanium\nProbably going to run you about three grand less than the sea RV ministers because Ford's into rebates on the escape Hondas more into leasing on the sea RV so they put their money on a leash into my losing famous low for does rebates so that the prices lower\nSo if you're going to buy not least I Would certainly have to look at the forward you kind of hit on one that I Love the with the Subaru Forester a great issue they love it in the way it performs in handles it's going to be about the thirty thousand miles or thirty thousand dollar range Nazi equipped\nI'm probably not quite as quiet as the forward but certainly worthy of taking a look and drive\nYou know a lot of it a few days ago I did a lot of it was a titanium both you know\nIf that that I really loved it but I have to look at it to several reports that they didn't care but it's also reliability that [noise] well\nAnd if you listen to the show much I Will tell you that my belief is of Consumer Reports says something about a car there's Ninety nine percent chance is wrong\nI I've I've followed the escape for well over a decade it has been a spectacular vehicle Consumer Reports has got I unbelievable biased against a in a domestic brands and in particular forward I don't know why\nUh I Would pay no attention to that if you liked the escape titanium psychic or what\nYou are psychic I Am I totally ... not just skip the team that two days ago yeah wow I sat in one two days ago how about that yeah bottom line don't listen to Consumer Reports people that buy the escape absolutely love it\n[noise] you're listening to the show with Jerry rental Kevin McCarthy [noise]\n\nThanks for joining us on the car for a show Kevin McCarthy Jerry rentals my video of the week in our newsletter was a real life hot wheels car they jumped\nOver one hundred yards in the air I thought it was digitally altered but it turns out it was true as world record Jerry's is also a hot rod it's a hot rod mobility scooter that Jerry says you ever need one that's when you want\nTo that time comes [laughter] by getting me one of them is just see you in the grocery store or after doing a hundred miles an hour right now [laughter] David in Austin that was with us just a minute ago we were talking about the\nEscape or titanium David apologize when we were up against a break and had to rush away but we decided to go that way and again don't listen to Consumer Reports are they are one of the most that they do I'm sure gr great job with\nPosters in washing machines and\nRefrigerators microwave but when it comes to cars I'm most butt heads with them every single thing they say\nAnd the fact that they didn't like the ... the ... that strengthens my belief is great choice for you leave Johnson forwards art dealer talked to James figure out the general sales manager told him I sent you they've been with us since we've been on the air in Austin which is a lotta years and they are terrific I promise you\nAnd Laura in Austin also welcome to the court procedure Laura\nHi

rent or which I used to a guy that report to work which is actually a hundred miles a day that ended up for a two thousand and three fifty diesel so I I had\nOh it's a horse trailer you know shock horses and stuff like that well the foil and I'm thinking it sooner or later it's like I had to get rid of it I don't know whether to go ahead and get those vehicles and get one vehicle\nThe horse trailer and get kind of semi good gas mileage or keep the three fifty gave me something you know look at it all the vehicle I Need one that can handle getting getting taken a deer down there's ... there's a lot of deer and I've already deployed runners killed five already\n[laughter] five\nYeah I get like Seventy ... rating to me those laws now or download packed all the other night that was

you for joining us here on the current approach show\nOur phone number one eight hundred cars Seventy seven Seventy seven that's where you'll find me and I'll give you straight talk announce answers about everything automotive like we do\nEverybody else every single weekend we're in this um tortoise turtle headed toward the end of march time period here we've got nine or ten days left in the month of march this is the next to the last weekend for march and that's that's never get because we're coming up on the hand of 'em aren't\nAlways great time to get something and believe me marches such big month for the dealers they've already they're already in my in mode and it'll just get better between now and the thirty first\nBut we're also at the end of the quarter and that's a big deal because out of manufacturers but I Do a lotta rebates and incentives and things at the end of the court and now you may not see 'em all\nSo I'm auto makers don't they're not all that visible with their rebates and incentives in their early ... and things that's just something they did behind the scenes others\nAre particularly the ... the domestics\nThey love to get out there and scream hey we've got six thousand dollars and rebates on a new Silverado or new F. one fifty or whatever\n[noise] so you kinda gotta look but just rest assured that were in that time a month and the time of quarter where the deals are good and they're going to remain good and through the thirty first to march and then all of a sudden the dealers go into\nThey go from one of the busiest months a year which is march it's always good month usually the weather is improving everywhere where they have\nIssues except yesterday in Baltimore wow they got a bunch of snow but they go from one of the best months a year in March to a very slow periods of time April first through April fifteenth\nThat's because the tax time people that buy cars and ... especially on the luxury side\nTraditionally have to pay taxes they've waited until the last minute to do their tax work or they got to write a check and they don't want to write a check to for down payment and then a check to the government at the same time so for just about all the car dealers they slowed down\nIn April I'm In and frankly that's not the best time to visit one I'll be honest with you uh you wanna you wanna do it when the volume is good they're busy they they want to get you in and out as quick as they can that means less going back and forth\nUm in in that sort of thing so right now is a good time that's the bottom line and if I can help you make a good car by indecision I'm right here for you at the carp Rochelle Kevin McCarthy is with me here buddy hey you're doing good doing good so far as you\nWere rolling yeah good gas mileage cruising got the cruise control on we are we are and I'm here kind of helping Jerry with some things behind the scenes so he can focus on giving you straight talking out of the answers and helping you\nKnow that's that's the big thing Gerry Dorsey he really likes to help people he wants to help you make a good car buying decision if you make a good decision you're going to be happy with it whether you lease it for three years or keep them for ten years\nOn a purchase if you make a bad one\nYou know you'd be like a caller we have two or three weeks ago that they uh man and woman bought a new truck\nAnd a week after they get the truck they find out that the seat doesn't sit ride for his bad back in\nThe trucks it's up to high for her to get in and out comfortably out and they decided this was a big mistake well a week after you buy something there's no grey area there's no all you can just try an hour after you buy some yeah right you know you can't go back and go uh uh I have my fingers crossed\nYou know not good to eat or work with you if you figure it out real quick yeah you know but once paddling in paperwork are gone they're gone\nIt's gone it's technically even if you just drive out of a lot and come back ten minutes later it's a used vehicle daily Lance selling used to be a theme or as much as it can under those are under the bed by minute you know but you know two or three days by then\nThe process has started the paperwork gone um the the rebates have been a applied for and gotten so now when they ... they don't have that five thousand dollar\nFactory rebate to use again you hit it twice you only do I so I I at least my wife's do must day as it is today I'm thinking gee second thought I might have bought it and it's their right to go back and
