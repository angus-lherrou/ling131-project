times a week and come back on to this because we want to do a little a little give away to help people get started\nBut a lot of people look at it as and there's more risk and the thing is is there's not more risk and in some cases there's actually less risk ... market than an abortion market\nBut one of the things that we can do to help people get started Larry's we got a big stack of tickets here for our show today we say we give away some passes to one of these half their classes definitely especially if there's somebody out there that now believes they hit a point in their lives when

to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nBut Larry that's one of the things I think people kind of miss on in a down market as it is we think oh it must be more risky and in some cases it's actually you can prove it out to be far less risky in a down market with how margin in different things work but at the same time\nAnything that we don't understand we're usually afraid of it isn't it just mainly fear that holds people back from accomplishing their goal so absolutely you know and in fact\nI'll share a story I sure what my students Jim the other day it was funny we were talking about this whole concept the fear of leaving a job\nAnd the worst thing that ever happens to any of us especially if you're listening is it all of a sudden you start working for someone else and then your net worth is tied up and to what other people defined it to be when they explain what I'm Talking about Ryan so yeah I remember the old story of the frog and the frog can jump as high as it possibly wants to\nBut if you want a frog in a box and you put a lid on top of that box and all of a sudden the frog tries a couple of times to jump\nBut hits the lead even when you take the little way the frog still will not jump higher than it could be for and that's kind of most of us out there and we start getting into these routes we're relying on a paycheck for somebody else we start to believe we can't make any more money and what's great when Jim ... and a lot of other students\nAnd we've been doing this for over Twenty years right now is that feeling of when you first start making more money than you do at work\nBecause then all of a sudden you're this frog again you can jump very very high and all of a sudden that cap that you've been believing your whole life has gone away\nAnd that's the sad part right now 'cause most people out there are stressed out that they have to stand a job they have no other outcome or vehicle when reality you can go ahead and you can short the markets\nSo great analogy like when I use is each week and I like using it as well I've said this over and over again when you're learning how to short the market meaning you're able to trade when the market goes down\nVery legal coach ... and the great part about it is I think of yourself in a car right now and you know you want to go somewhere but if the car only one and drive and never went in reverse\nYou can eventually get there it's not going to be cost efficient for gas or time but you actually get there where why would you want to do that\nPeople do that everyday Ryan what they're trading they're only looking in the markets to go higher and as you said when the markets go lower it could be an opportunity to buy at a discount it doesn't always mean there's a problem with the stock\nYeah absolutely right there there's opportunities all over the place and and I love what you're talking about what the frog because 'cause it you know I was teaching a class last night and I have another session with with the same group tonight and you know I was talking about how a lot of the the the obstacles that we have to overcome our mental\nRight and and what you're talking about the frog hitting it's had on the boxing you move the box and all of a sudden they can jump up\nIs that it it is that ceiling that we're putting on ourselves right and we we have the whole ... I Can't do that type of a conversation I have a five year old son who who over and over the the words I Can't or or just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose uh would you start to put those binders on us and and make it so that we realize oh if I jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head as we stop even trying you know a while ago they you know I'm ... years and years ago they they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile a list ... about a week ago there was the world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winter and about a six minute mile for twenty six miles after doing a hundred mile bike ride if you can't run a four minute mile you're you're not even on Olympic on Olympic track and field team anymore at least one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to back right\nSo so so these these these these restraints that we put on ourselves we also put on our finances and we ended up kind of painting that our own picture that we end up residing in it and if you're if you're willing to kind of challenge the norm and you're willing to put in a little more effort or a lot\nBe granted to you and it really just does come from getting started and putting a little bit more effort in but we could have a few more people get started we've got a stack of tickets here the show is just beginning when you say we do know that give away let's do it right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area and they have to classes where you see exactly what it takes to really generate that consistent income in the market whether the market's going up down or sideways\nNow in just a second year and have a chance to win a set of passes and one of these classes\nAnd so if you're driving now is a good time to pull over and get that phone ready included with your passes is going to be a professional insider skit it's packed with lessons from some of our top instructors now the professional insiders kids critical because it makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H\nClass dot com and see if you can sports fans there we're up against the clock Larry when you have a force next you know lots of students asking us all the time hey if I'm looking to make more income does that mean I have to get more jobs and the answer is absolutely no let's talk about that [noise] multiple streams of income on the other side of the break with ...

that's free OT a class dot com\n[noise] you're listening to power trading radio [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development top instructor it online training academy shed some light on consistency in the markets\nWere talking about generating more money we're talking about generating more income whether the market's going up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets but when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities to generate into give generate more income and fish and give yourself a raise\nAnd it really is important to remember that\nThe more that money is made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of gains on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling if you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combined and so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crashed there is a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they are looked at as a a a not so they're looked at with not such a pleasant light we could say because\nWhen they made all that money a lot of people were losing money a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals do who look at a down market as a bad thing now these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they had that skill set they had that knowledge they knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money is the marks are going up that's kind of the situation our income in our retirement accounts or in if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways\nAnd if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why\nThe kid there at the addict because I'm I'm available now and we can eat together as a family um I get my trading dying and die they're happy\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learn more at frailty a class dot com that's free OT a class dot com\n[noise] this is how retraining radio now back to the show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and ... got to be really shed some light on different income stream instead of the market we're talking a little bit about passive income we're talking\nAbout active and can we are talking about making money out of money not time is money money is money right and having our money working harder for us the average millionaire and we we ... and I both flip through this article a little while ago and there there was a report on how the average millionaire has\nFive or more streams of income out there and those multiple streams of income or really will create that financial freedom that everybody's after right not just that one source not one source of income when you have that sole source that's why job stance jail we'll be right stands for just over broke because if we're just relying on it we are just over broke\nBecause if it goes away we're in a world of hurt\nWell in this segment here we wanted to spend a little bit of time on retirement accounts\nThe markets have been super volatile right we've had a big us we've had big down and so what can we do to protect those retirement accounts and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe been with us for the whole show get excited\nThe best is yet to come and Larry whenever I'm Talking with a lot of our listeners sometimes has to be a social media\nAnd a lot of them when it comes to retirement accounts are saying number one they're saying they don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire or just not quite sure really what they should be doing with it and so it's kind of the consolidated message that you can or individual messages whichever direction you'd like to take it\nThat that you and your instructor team early giving to those people who are concerned about their retirement accounts especially with the with the big drop we had in the market the other day well the simple thing I Would share with our\nThe cavalry ain't come and there's nobody who's going to protect your capital better than you can right now in the way to do that with education I mean right now statistically about every ten years the market has corrected we saw fifty percent correction in two thousand uh fifty eight percent correction in two thousand eight\nWho's to say we might not see a sixty four sixty seven percent correction in the market and matching your four one K. becoming a one oh one K. and the reason for this is\nThis is the first generation right now that it's been subjected to market fluctuations in your retirement accounts\nThink about it prior you had pensions that was completely outside of the market you're basically boss put aside their profits or payroll to make sure you had a retirement account and right now that's gone away you're completely dependent upon your four one K. and here's a scary\nThought Ryan you know I've talked about this all the time right now people have been told and I've been doing this pretty pretty habitually of putting money into their retirement account every two weeks when they get paid\nBut here's the big problem and I want everyone to listen to this 'cause it's kind of scary right now is that you've been putting money into this market the last three years at an all time highs not when the market was low so imagine when there is another correction the first money that's going to come out is the most expensive amount of money that you've been saving towards retirement\nA lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their trades to be able to maximize for their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nYeah it's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics were ahead of my class last night as as the markets don't change the marks don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape but getting printed off right but the markets still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high\nAnd somewhere along the lines we kinda got distracted from that and I think the average investors out they're investing their money on payday and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price it's pretty much impossible for us to make any money\nOne of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account it's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this whole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her\nOr or or things that we want to be invested in rather than be invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that uh when it first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects and\nDan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remember it I won't share it are there but it was just kind of funny he he would say you can't live their stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is if you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially investigated this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about it on an honestly why would they write and Larry you're talking about\nYou know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are\nAnd and it's it is true and the reason\nThat I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of Mike accept for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound nobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement and said this perpetual kind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person\nHas many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a\nA car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional in the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up uh falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area that have to cost ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half the class including with your past is going to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nBecause tender twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside\nBut also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down absolutely a little out of\nOur students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market isn't a downturn\nSo this great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options and that's why they can do this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students\nStudents like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives that people don't understand that again the markets go down as an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks and they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something to happen like I said again the cavalry ain't come in\nAnd the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R. it's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so if all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested wouldn't that be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world those risks are award how ... what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or have take classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so so even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time\nWell what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points have returned to your to your portfolio every year 'cause really your risk is the only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to this after class\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio and imagine\nThat you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your ... can you can learn how to reallocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nUm network capitalism and not one of the number one ranked lenders on consumer affairs\nDot com a top one hundred mortgage company and mortgage executive magazine one of America's fastest growing companies six years running a top thirty financial service company in the nation recently named as one of the best places to work by the best companies group for years running one of the best mortgage lenders for two thousand Eighteen\nPer nerd wallet dot com over four thousand five star reviews\nAnd I'm not surprised so one thing I wanted to squeeze in on this one is I've been saving this review a little bit I Want to make sure we get it in before the clock it\nExpires and goes to zero is this customer he listens to us on the mortgage radio show he picked up the phone just like you're about to doubt eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight and he listens to W.

to power trading radio [noise] welcome back if\nYou're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs director instructor development and top instructor it online trading ketamine shed some light on consistency in the markets\nWere talking about generating more money we're talking about generating more income whether the market's going up down or sideways\nTalking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets\nBut when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities to generate and to give generate more income and essentially give yourself a raise and it really is important to remember that the more that money is made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of games on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling if you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combined so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crashed there is a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they are looked at as a a a not so they looked at with not such a pleasant light we could say because\nWhen they made all that money a lot of people were losing money a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals do who look at a down market as a bad thing now these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they have that skill set they had that knowledge they knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making many of them are going up that's\nKind of the situation our income in retirement accounts or in if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways and if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why\nIt's very difficult to follow the kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nBut how much opportunity has been lost on those down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn where we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how 'bout instead of that\nInstead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money as the market going down we start doubling up on this stuff\nNo absolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand they start trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time and here's why the number one mistake most people making their lives when it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some educational a bit later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shared by Ninety five percent of the population were Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people\nSo that means there was five percent of us who have understood the right way to trade how to make money and what's really scary right now and I talked to a lot of students as I ask them a simple question\nDo you work for more money or just money work for you and most people are working for more money they always believe that they're going to get ahead if they're going to find their freedom and let's face it\nPeople who start trading are people looking for multiple streams of income and most millionaires we discuss this right have a an average five income streams\nThey're doing so not because they're working harder they're working smarter they're figuring out how to work right and what that simply means is if there's a way to learn how to generate income without having to put more effort that's the best way to do it and most of the time\nPeople don't understand that training is like a system what's the system it stands for save yourself stress time energy and money love it if you learn how from professionals to do things the right way there's no reason why you can't be generating income as well\nMost people either don't know how to do this or are afraid to do this and honestly they keep going out there in thinking that they're going to attain freedom by working more and more well most people I talk to my students give me an example mc ... used to work in the workplace he quit he want it to work for himself\nHe wanted more time with his family well if you can learn a skill that will allow you to make money the same way the banks do and you've shared district me many times Ryan J. P. Morgan Chase had only nine losing days in the last five years\nI don't know about you guys what I Want to be on that team that keeps making that money and the only way you're going to do that is by investing in the education and learning how to do that can you see how this could help lead you to spending more time with family or just leave a job you don't like any more\nYou in so many times individuals get caught up in the rat race and you start hearing people use phrases like time is money right and that that's what you're talking about earlier as is exchanging just time and getting a wage right getting paid for our time now\nThat the thing that we always like to focus on his money is money Ryan how can we make money how can we make money work for us rather than like what you're saying working for working for money and that's really what starts to to to separate\nThe financially independent from the financially dependent out there are those multiple streams of income and a lot of that comes from having our money work harder than our body is working and that the whole time is money concept is something that I used to ah\nAh I used to say all the time and I worked for my dad's construction business I had an hourly wage and everything like that and so it was very normal thing for me to to to to to equate time with money but it started getting into investing I I realized how bad of a mindset that actually is about easy trap to fall into because it's what we've been told our whole lives\nBut we really what we have to focus on his wrist or reward and having our money work harder than our body and one of the ways where we can help a few people get started on that later if you're up for it as we can do a quick little give away with some of these tickets we got here let's do some more giveaways right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area that have to classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really generate that consistent income up down or sideways\nSupplemental income or primary income inside of the financial markets have and that money work hard rather than your body work hard right now the half day classes about three hours long we called the half the class but you're really going to be investing about three hours of your time\nJulie raise that financial IQ and start generating more income inside of the financial markets and included with your passes to the half the class is going to be our professional insiders kit packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional inside her kid makes it so you can get started right now\n... when he did a call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nBut there are multiple types of income that we're just kind of touching on there but we have the passive income we have the the active income we have the a supplemental income we have the primary income was kind of a hot topic out there ... ... what do you see most people getting excited about as far as different income streams in the market\nAnd Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are and and it's it is true and the reason that I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live on\nOf our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of my ... except for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound nobody cares\nRight there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their money's into retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account the replaces somebody who is closing their retirement status perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person\nHas many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice\nOn what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds that we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional in this situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up ah falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that 'cause we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area that half the cost of ... ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half the class including with your passes it going to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nColors tender twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there now Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside\nBut also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down\nAbsolutely a little a lot of our students have figured out they can use other types of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market isn't a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they come to this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students\nStudents like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for the correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives like people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something that happened like I said again\nThe cavalry ain't come in and the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R. it's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested wouldn't that be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world is restored how what what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or half day classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so so even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time\nWell what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points of return to your your portfolio every year because really your risk is the only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to this half the class\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio\nAnd imagine that you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your four one K. and you can learn how to reallocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nYou know it goes back to some of those are some of those unquote the way I always like to throw out here as far as you don't have to be ... and I'm going to do this one wrong or you take it it's yours ... yeah I ... I used to always say you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great\nAnd unless you do all used when a Ryan's is you don't want to spend your golden years at the golden arch absolutely I Love that one you know and and it's all the wherever these fun cliches things that we love to throw around but they've been around forever 'cause they're true\nRight we've heard him so many times 'cause they're true no nobody ever says well no you you don't have to get started in order to be great you know you do you have to have to be great you have to get started but you don't have to be great in order to get started right it's awesome and\nAnd I love doing uh I get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity race in a in a couple of days\nAre raising money for cancer and and I always compare it to just a race you have to cross the start line before you can cross the finish line it is necessary right but it is is a lot of fun and trading investing you can take this really whatever level you want but imagine the imagine if\nImagine if it just made that slightest impact in your life to the positive how worth it with a three hour investment be now before we can get people into class they gotta have tickets we gotta do give away\nLet's do it All right we're right now we've got a ... class coming up in your area\nAnd that the costs really where you'll be able to see exactly what it takes to keep their retirement account growing whether the markets are going up down or sideways and now including with your passes to half the class is going to be our professional insiders kit\nIt's packed with lessons from some of our top instructors now the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there we've got to take a quick break we're going to be right back Larry whatever force next\nYou know let's talk about the lifestyle of a trade or a lot of people now are sitting here may be interested in realizing they want to make a\nChange they need to make a change in their lives let's talk about what the effects are making such as they\nWere going to pull back the curtain show you what that looks like right around the brake ran and Larry we'll be right back [noise]\n\nAt online training academy our mission is to offer exceptional financial education so you could live the life you've always wanted maybe it's just having that peace of mind so you don't have to worry so much about the bills or even just having the luxury of not working so hard\nTo have more time to spend with the family graduates of online training academy share it with us all kinds of stories here's one one racing graduate had to say\nI bartender that a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas often maybe eight years I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different of needed time I needed my life\nAnother student says ... you can find happening at a career and training that's something that I had always wanted to death and so if I die for that had a chemical or start that changed my life\nLearn more visitors on line that free O T H ... Tom that's free OT a class dot com\n[noise] you're listening to power trading radio [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs director of instructor development and top instructor and online trading can be really shed some light on generating more income in the market a lot of times we'll talk\nAbout income for today or income for tomorrow me our retirement account income right but really that's what this is all about it's consistent growth whether I'm gonna use it to pay my bills today or whether\nIs this fair builds a moral it's all about having that consistent strategy so we can have multiple streams of income multiple streams coming out of the financial markets\nAnd I've taken multiple streams that is one of these I Love about the financial markets as you can mail a stream of income via commodities their derivatives you know there could be a dividend type ... that you build out there's an easy way inside of these financial markets to get to that kind of four or five\nIncome streams are inside of the financial markets or whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listener maybe even with us for the whole show get excited\nThe best is yet to come and Larry a lot of our listeners are new to the markets and they're just looking to get started off on the right foot and many have been really investing for a while but not really quite reaching their goals and others are doing well\nAnd they're looking to do a little bit better maybe there's a a consolidated message that you could give it to those three or even if you want to address all three of individually that's fine but what what is it that the what's the message that you guys are putting out to those guys right now we'll look the number one mistake that most new traders are experienced traders make\nAs they try to do this on their own very little education what makes a TA so different\nIs we simplify trading it's a simple step by step investment strategy called the core strategy we asked students can you do this and it's yes and yes so if you're somebody who was looking for an education because it's easy to learn it's perfect for beginners\nIt's perfect for any account size you get to learn and live markets and you can start immediately this is definitely something you want to do its time right now to ask yourself if all this did was teach you how to make some extra money would it be worth it\nUsing essentially fifty percent of his dollars that his traditional portfolio is going to take a hundred percent of the dollars see that's really cool that's what that's what you know and and by the way I don't have a problem if you want to call the office and say run my numbers I'm going to go to your broker\nI have absolutely no problem\nUh giving you the data to say do me a favor or I'm going to retire in three five ten years show me what my guaranteed income is folks you ain't getting a number\nSeat and now this is a cool thing about you because you're very transparent you're very words like you were allowed to be goatee or other planners like asking these questions see we'll see you ... where you feel comfortable finds out\n... sorry go ahead find out if you're working with an accumulation specialist or distribution specially with you know and my thirty five years I'm always amazed people walk into which just sort of the the go to plan you walk into anybody in the financial community they show you a bunch of pie charts I become so you know it's it's\nIt's a disdain pie charts yeah because people stare at them and look at him there is zero data on there that will actually improve your life\nWell I got to tell you something and I and I had an a ha moment yeah er about this and this week the the thing about accumulation specialists and and be and accumulating in connection with is that it's fun it's fun to see what percentage you can grow fund to to ride the roller coaster and it's fun it\nIt it's addictive absolutely talking about distribution and ... you know consistency and it's ... it's way more practical and way more um it gives you a much better retirement it's not\nExciting well it's not exciting on on many levels first of all it's terrifying for many because you had that last paycheck you got I got to tell\nUntil you've done it you won't believe it ... that that last paycheck you get you look at that bucket money bucket of money that you had been saving for thirty five years well guess what folks your days as a saver\nAre about to transition to a spender\nSo that magic killer of secrets returns that had zero impact on you for the last ten twenty Thirty years now it's your worst enemy\nOp so I asked a buddy of mine who's a who is in the financial world about how he addressed his sequence of returns right what he said he looked at me like I ... you know it was about to hit him with my car there you know like if he didn't he\nThey don't get it I told you I started that those financial edu classes and I asked the entire room of people who are basically forty people I said how many of us that the sequence of returns conversation with your advisor Phil\nNot a single and winter okay so land for everybody all kinds of return it is you need to Google ... so you really can get clear on this\nThe secret to return to what I wrote a chapter\nAnd won the award for and Steve Forbes west book uh\nThat I send everybody when you call into the radio show it's simply states\nThat day you leave work average returns mean nothing the real data I use for the chapter imagine this\nImagined averaging ten point one percent a year for Twenty years I think you'd be like I say you'd be the the star at all the parties and only spending five\nWait your penniless Twenty years how in God's name is that possible how can you average ten point one\nOnly spend half of that and be penniless real simple folks sequence overturns if you lose money early on\nYou can not read cover because remember when you take a dollar from an asset that has declined you're locking in the law so\nIn other words if the economy tanks like within the first five or seven to retire right you're in trouble\nThat's right if you thought about retiring in Nineteen Ninety eight or Ninety nine or two thousand and six or two thousand seven I tell you what you are either looking for another job shortly thereafter or you reduced you're spending radically I\nAnd have the skill set to completely address the sequence of returns risk longevity risk\nLong term care risk\nSocial Security maximum is Asian or when women ate that risk I also want to imitate the risk of taxes being substantially\nHigher when you retired a lot of people are totally not prepare for the train it's coming down the tracks were those who are George for one and defined benefit plans that have two three five million dollars and um yes what the taxes are going to blow that account outfits the tax time ...\nDo you find that like the super wealthy understand misguided\nAll that I didn't feel it's too late felt really because they have their eye on the accumulation of like you said that the addictive part all I got to I got five I got twelve million and a defined plan\nWhat they don't realize 'cause you sit in my office five days a week with some Seventy plus year olds who now we're starting to tap these dollars they go oh my God I had no idea what they're required distributions are oh loner\nI arrest is going to clean me\nOut well and I think the other thing that's that's difficult for people in that situation is that they've spent a lifetime of learning how to make money and they've done a really they've been really successful at it and all of the sudden\nCaught having to admit or having to realize that weight I don't really understand what my money is is doing my act\nWe right now because God God help the individual who really they've accumulated they've accumulated but they didn't really understand how those dollars have to be spent down in the agreement they made with the IRS thirty five years\nYeah well we have to take a break but the number is eight hundred for nine nine one six five eight that eight hundred for nine nine one six five eight\nGive that number of calls sit down with Blair and get a free retirement income analysis\nThis is where he's going to really educate you on what happens in retirement to your money how to set it up so that you have a distribution or an income stream for the life of predictable income stream it's a paycheck so that you don't finish working and not\nHave a a you know not have a paycheck you're when you're with just withdrawing\nMoney off of ... of hope so mentality so the idea is to have this income stream and then have your other money and investment firm and feel very holding very protected and it was a shack in the ... league right at least you're you're a necessity are covered and you'll never have to worry about running out of that\nSo eight hundred for nine nine one six five eight you're listening to the financial bottom line my name's\nFilter on the line with as always well planner and strategist founder of time with
