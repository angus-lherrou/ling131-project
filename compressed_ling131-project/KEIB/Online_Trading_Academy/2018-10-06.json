going and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading in investing in some of them are just looking to you know fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of it is of additional income um\nYou know some of them are looked like gets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work and then scratch their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules\nSo a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spend time at a job they get better and better at it before they know what they're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responsibilities\nWhat I've talked to students about their biggest concern is right now is what if we have another major correction where are they going to be able to make up that income\nAnd you know it's not a question anymore of if it's when we're already starting to see\nReminiscent of what happened in two thousand seven or the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again we're starting to see housing prices going down again the construction industry is starting to to go down again so there are opportunities here for people to not have a situation happened to them again like it did before\nAnd I don't think anybody out there is on their deathbed going you know Ryan I Wish I could a worked another day\nYeah that's not the that's not the norm when it comes to New Year's resolutions it's like you know we did a big New Year's resolutions be back in January on the show and then it'll be fun to do another one that's next January but one of the things\nThat we we went through if you recall we went through the top the top ten on New Year's resolutions and and one of them was like I Hope I work like you were saying I Hope I work till the ... to tell the day I die and and and other ones where I Want a downgrade my lifestyle and\nAnd and and and unfortunately those are those are reality is that they did a lot of people end up in but they don't need to right they don't need to end up in those situations and it really just takes a couple of small two weeks\nI I did a I did a lecture I don't even know it was it was probably eight years ago and I stumbled upon a recording of it a couple of days ago\nAnd the whole point of the lecture was about how little things become big things\nAnd so you can look at it you can look at things where you say okay well well what if I could generate a little more income and what if it was five dollars a day right now at five dollars they could turn into ten dollars a day could turn into twenty dollars and it started with that five dollars a day and next thing you know a few years from now or maybe five years from now it's five hundred dollars a day right but it had\nTo have a starting point it goes back to some of the phone calls you always throw in like the ... and stuff like that where I and I might miss this up so if I Do correct me with it on it but it is you don't have to be great\nIt started but you have to get started to be great right there's there's all sorts of fun things like that\nThat are out there that are that are will call cliche but they're also so true right there is so true and they're they're they're they're necessary for us to say they're necessary for us to hear but then there are also\nNecessary for us to take action on if we want to generate that extra income because that's really what ends up failing in our New Year's resolutions as we say okay well I Want to make more money I Want to lose weight well there's there is a step by step process to both of those and at the end of the year the reason why maybe we didn't make more money or we didn't lose weight the reason we didn't is staring back at us in the mere\nRant and really we've got to own that we've got to say okay I'm not going to let anything be my optical and especially that person in the mirror is not going to be ... obstacle which just simply means usually changing some of our habits in changing what we're doing is not a complete life overhaul but it's just adding a few more pieces in that can help it generates more income and to have the economy really spend a lot of time going through some of these step by step process as\nThey can help generate more income before you to see those you're going to need to you're going to need to have tickets so they'll let you in one of the things we can do or if you're up for it as we give away some more ticket let's do it\nAll right well right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area\nThat have to classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to start generating multiple streams of income\nIncome through stock options futures currencies right multiple streams of income\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these classes so if you are driving now's the time to pull over and get that phone ready including with your passes it's going to be a professional insiders kid now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kid makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nThe the multiple streams of income topic is one that I Love Larry I Love how how you can really approached the financial markets you really can't pick out commodities you could separate commodities you can separate options you can separate currencies you could separate separate aid evidence strategy and very very quickly you could build out four to five six even seven\nDifferent types different streams of income\nFrom the different financial markets that we have out there and we haven't even touched on real estate or owning another business or different things like that that can be passive as well but right here in the financial markets where all you really need is an Internet connection we have the opportunity or we have the access of generating these multiple streams of what are some of the what are some of the multiple streams what are some of the secondary streams are some of the passive type\nUh types of income that you see a lot of the students focusing on that are really helping them reach their financial freedom Gulf well\nBefore I jump into that let's take a look again about just getting a second job people think by simply adding some zeroes at the end of their income\nThey're simply going to be out of debt where most of the time they don't get educated enough and they're adding more zeroes the end of their expenses\nSo one of the ways you can look at this as as you mentioned are students realized that they can be trading and this is really about them so even if you're listening it's about you what are your goals right now what are you trying to attain\nBut when you're averaging your price back up by these all time highest offsets all the money that was invested in that for all and came back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with us which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK right we just have to know that\nA Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer as the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got a kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as there he says okay let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area they have to classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement growing whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now\nIs a great time to pull over including with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nYou know we've talked a lot about kind of the growing side of things with their retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we've got we have a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where your risk reward rely so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that I told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and\nThen you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight fact I speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction at some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you have the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what they have in their retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your saved retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you switch you have to start doing right now is thinking well\nIf I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income enables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compound annually\nYou can start thinking about generating the money you need to retire the right way and again this comes down to getting yourselves educated\nI said before earlier is that most people make the greatest mistake possible try to wing it on their own by reading books are watching Youtube videos and you see right right I I'm not going to go on line learn how to fly a plane from a Youtube video then go up to its white school go watch the Youtube video can I get in the cockpit right now and take off\nDoesn't make any sense well the same thing can be said about your money as as I Love from the movie the pursuit of happiness Chris gardener mother played portrayed by Will Smith once said the cavalry ain't come and you have to care more about your money than anybody else and that means protecting yourself by getting yourself educated as quickly as possible\nWhen whenever you whenever you bring up a the pursuit of happiness and you say the ... coming it always reminds me of another quote a and I don't know where it originated from but our our our friend Keely would always say over and over she'd always say this life is not a dress rehearsal\nOver and over I've heard her say that a million times I don't remember where she got it from that will give you a credit for that one right now now one of the things about the fees that you were touching on that I just want to elaborate on before we jump into this break is is you were talking about thirty percent can end up going to fees and there was an article I saw a little while ago that shows how the average person spends three years of their life\nPaying for the fees so if you make fifty thousand dollars a year you can expect to be about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you can expect to pay about three hundred thousand dollars\nIn fees one of the things you can do to avoid those fees it's really take control of your of your money but before you should do that you need to know how to do it\nWhat great place to start that just started that educational process is that one of our half the class and we just happen to have a stack of tickets here Larry are you ready I'm ready All right well right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area and a half day class as we can see exactly what it takes really take control those retirement generate that income for today and make sure that you have that income for tomorrow\nAnd it just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these have to classes\nSo if you were driving now is a great time to pull over and get that phone ready now included with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kitten is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors my favorite thing about the professional insiders ... is it makes it so you can get started right now\n... when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is\nEight seven seven nine four to eight seven to

they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer as the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as I said okay let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area they have to classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement growing whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nAnd just a second you can have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passage is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhancing retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve\nThose seats the number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nYou know we've talked a lot about the growing side of things with their retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we got we have a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where your risk reward rely so many people imagine if it to get back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that have told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and then you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight fact I speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction at some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you have the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what happened to retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your saved retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you\nSwitch to start doing right now is thinking well if I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income enables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compound annually\nYou can start thinking about generating the money you need to retire the right way and again\nThis comes down to getting your cells educated\nWhat I said before earlier is that most people make the greatest mistake possible try to wing it on their own by reading books are watching Youtube videos and you'll see right right I I'm not going to go on line learn how to fly a plane from a Youtube video and then go up to fly school go watch the Youtube video can I get in the cockpit right now and take off\nDoesn't make any sense well the same thing can be said about your money as as I Love from the movie the pursuit of happiness Chris gardener mother played portrayed by Will Smith once said the cavalry ain't come and you have to care more about your money than anybody else and that means protecting yourself by getting yourself educated as quickly as possible\nWhen whenever you whenever you bring up a the pursuit of happiness and you said a cavalry come and it always reminds me of another quote a and I don't know where it originated from but our our our friend Keely would always say over and over she'd always say this life is not a dress rehearsal\nOver and over I've heard her say that a million times I don't remember where she got it from the will give credit for that one right now now one of the things about the fees that you were touching on that I just want to elaborate on before we jump into this break is is you were talking about thirty percent can end up going to fees and there was an article I saw a little while ago that shows how the average person spends three years of their life\nPaying for the fees so if you make fifty thousand dollars a year you can expect to be about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you can expect to pay about three hundred thousand dollars\nIn fees one of the things you can do to avoid those fees is really take control of your of your money before you should do that you need to know how to do it\nWhat great place to start that just start that educational process is that one of our half the class and we just happen to have a stack of tickets here Larry are you ready I'm ready All right well right now we've got a half the class coming up in your area and a half the class\nAs we can see exactly what it takes really take control those retirements generate that income for today and make sure that you have that income for tomorrow and it just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these have take classes\nSo if you were driving those great time to pull over\nAnd get that phone ready now included with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kitten is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors my favorite thing about the professional insiders ... is it makes it so you can get started right now\n... when he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his free votes da class dot com and see if you could worsen faster than\nWe got to take a quick break but learning what should we talk about let's talk about the lifestyle of official trader how your life has changed once you're able to strike generating somebody than\nWe're going to fall back to current on a say in the life of a traitor stick with us right and there will be right back [noise]\nAt online training academy our mission is to offer exceptional financial education so you could live the life you've always

graduates of online training academy share but there's all kinds of stories here's one one racing graduate had to say\nHi bar tended at a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas off and maybe eight years I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and\nShe abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something

they're just looking to get started off on the right foot and many have been really investing for a while but not quite reaching their their goals and others have been doing well and really they're just looking to do better what's kind of that or\nWhat what's the message that you can give to all three of those that can really help them take that next step but really help them get the ball
