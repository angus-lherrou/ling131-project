[noise] my name is Ryan Coogler side of the joining\nMe as always is my great friend and director of instruction development and top instructor down I ... to me he\nIs everyone wants to be like and that is because he is the brains of the operation out here that's for sure\nBut I got Larry out here and Larry first question for you is how that you're doing doing great Ryan how're you doing I'm doing wonderful excited to be out here with ya doing the show this week we have a lot of fun or doing the show and talking to you our financial family out there across the airwaves\nAnd one of the things we always focus the vast majority of our time on I Would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get you know in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to\nHow to generate more income inside of the financial markets and one of the things we always stress and I I Know we'll spend a lot of time on a tear today is how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down whether the market's going sideways and and that's really the the key is because there's three directions and and as individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold\nKinda bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that and we hold it for a long time and and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth uh it's just worth a heck of a whole lot more now one of the things I Want to get some of your feedback on it's always a a fun show starter\nIs really the consistency side of things because really if we're going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be directional Lee dependent than what I mean by that is we can't\nOnly profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach at half day classier it on a train economy one of my favorite things it's really work with the class and get them to viewed down markets as opportunities not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as oh that's so bad 'cause people are losing money and all that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith the right knowledge and what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major crashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the source of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name\nAt the end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nAnd it really just boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but what are some of the things you guys are working on with the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team are are laying out there right now to help people become more consistent and less directional independent inside of the markets\nWill this last week has been beautiful I mean everything we've been talking about on the show together I'm Talking about this for weeks now waiting for the opportunity to see the markets correct and come back down and as a result what happens starting off at the end of last week into this week as we got everybody's wish that\nThe market started coming down it comes down three times faster than it goes up and a lot of our students were taught that once that market goes down you could actually make money shorting the market it's called shorting where you're actually selling in the market\nAs opposed to most people who buy the markets so a lot of our students shift from that fear of oh my God the market's going down I don't know what to do more to lose money to well I can actually learn how to make money if the markets go down it's simply doing what the banks do\nBig banks are always out there to make money whether the markets go up down sideways and what a lot of our students seeing we tell them is do you see how this would benefit you by learning how to trade in more than just one direction\nAnd when you look at even the difference between let's even just say a mutual fund versus a hedge fund and the mutual fund is generally just investing into a long position and they called a mutual funds because it's this joint effort between us and the financial institution but it only makes money as the markets are going up but it doesn't mean that strategy is never useful now that product is never useful that's not what I'm trying to get out here\nBut as it's going down those phones are generally losing money and we're paying fees to be involved or to be invested into that fund you look at the a hedge fund type strategy and and that word Hedges pretty critical because hedge\nIs meaning that there is a position that prompts on the way up and there's also protection or even a position that could profit on the way down and so when you start looking at things as far as the market's going there's multiple directions in the market the up down into sideways\nIt's critical to make sure that we have strategies kind of like that hedged mentality that can make money if the markets are going up down her sideways and you're one of the things I talked about it\nThe class has a long time ago was or wasn't managing if you went to work then they said hey you know what\nWe really like you you're a great candidate we think he'd be a great fit for the company\nBut you can expect to be laid off one third of the time one third of the time we're not going to pay a\nYou know and that's really what happens if we're only trading any bullish direction anytime the markets are going sideways our retirement account or income account is laid off\nAnytime the markets are going down a retirement account or income account is is laid off not to not to even bring up the fact that maybe it's it's deteriorating a little bit especially as the markets are going down\nBut what are the things that we can do is always okay with you Larry when things that we can do is we have a big stack of tickets right here we are just kicking the show off we've got a bunch of tickets we can give away and we can help a few people out there get started becoming more consistent in the market by but you'd a quick little give away for these passes that our to our half day classes what do you

or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track because of this this consistency conversation I should say you know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the market going down\nWhat are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bombs but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go well you can always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people playing out of the market\nSo the Martin he's going somewhere either could go into gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here as it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before we teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock short bond short gold shark\nThey're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market now that day imagine that we did a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make you money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a bit later\nAt it you know as a sitting here thinking what you're saying and you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing which really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh when I say this but with the frog\nIf you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you covered the box a couple of times the frog hits the top lid and even if it's just that little way they still can't jump in the higher the way the lid was\nWe don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least ... definition of of self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagine you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd now there are only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom in doing the things we wanted to rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more of these passes what he say let's do it right now you have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income\nWhether that supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks\nDoesn't matter it's all about generating more income and we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half their classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that great or warning that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these have to classes to get your phone's writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes are professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhancing your time or a strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional inside of kept makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we needed a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow as we're kind of going down his income conversation we were talking about supplemental income in primary income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income what's kind of that that that that starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income past somebody's looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start people\nOff with well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and ... says you don't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great\nSo many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly well ... not at all in fact most of our instructors will tell our students is I Would it's not about quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love\nBecause if we can put our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams right we don't want to do that because we're looking for multiple income streams but at the same time you've heard this expression our whole lives right don't work hard work smart well\nThat's not how people who make a lot of money I think they're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right and what working right means is they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things that are students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because\nFace it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could a worked just one more day that would have been excellent no they're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love\nAnd to think about it just because you're going out and setting a second job yeah you may get a couple of extra zeroes at the end of your income but if you don't have to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management\nYou just going to have more zeroes on the end of your expenses so a lot of people are miserable they're out there thinking they've got to work even harder and harder with teaching students how to work right and that simply means coming in and understanding how you could create more freedom for yourself\nAnd hopefully people are listening right now I can see how could they could create more freedom\nYeah and it's all about generating that skill you know you're you're talking about people coming in and looking to make money out of the gates and just you know I Want to I Want to take this dollar entered into a million dollars by went by tomorrow it's like okay it's not very realistic right\nBut so one of the things we always like to bring that up is it's all about generate generating skill building the skill and the money comes after you have to have the skill first just like in any other\nBusiness in any other walk of life the skill is something that we that we really have to have first and I always tell everybody if you're looking for a big get rich quick program\nThen have to cost probably isn't for you and really the financial markets probably aren't for you and that's that's just being real because we have to generate the skills to be able to generate the income and building any skill usually isn't an overnight process it's usually something that takes a little time\nAlso said to add to that because I Love where you're going you also can't be someone who doesn't take action you don't want to get to stay stuck where you are right now and you're not coach of all those are definitely things that are not going to work out for you but if you're somebody who really is interested in learning a new skill\nThat can ultimately benefit you in the long run and this is an excellent opportunity for you\nYeah if you're looking to build some skills in the financial market and learn how to generate a greater source of income\nAnd you're willing to put in the time as Larry says well then I think you may be our

you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs director of structure development and top instructor it online trading fabulously shed some light on multiple streams of in a little bit about half of income we talked a little bit about active income\nAnd then specifically spend a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the the the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus dreams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but\nBut even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later in so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right I mean how many times have you talked to a a a surgeon and they said oh well you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first otherwise that operating table can be dangerous spot to be laying\nNow unfortunately it ends up being that same but that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously we work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday\nRight just 'cause it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money and our retirement accounts and it will just slowly growing and well that's true with abortion marketing a bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we are going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets there deteriorating\nAnd it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck when we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWow Jeannie it's all there no charge obligation and we will part friends regardless so money matters dot net All right we're going to take a break and when we come back we're talking about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor so stay tuned this has money matters and I am ...\nFlashy flunk Hughes over your\nLast one was the father\nCountry is they hung on treatment ... than\nWe are wallowing in champagne this is money matters with Kendall rape but of course I Am your host can

these are the very same idea that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients\nAnd we're not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states oh infinity\nOn beyond yes indeed\nAnd uh you know we specialize in working with people who are retired or retiring soon so our focus is on retirement planning\nAnd we would love to work with you if you are so if you're in that demo as they say and uh so recently barons named more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors actually now for the seven year in a row\nAnd I'm very proud of that designation but without our clients that would be no where at all so all your clients listening right now thank you so much\nA if you're not a client I encourage you to go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net you can learn more about us we have podcasts of this show you can go back to listen to a we have articles on retirement planning topics we have videos on the same so we have all kinds of stuff on there that I think you can benefit from\nUm this is the part of the show where we talk about estate planning we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the\nFruits of your labor and we do this because money isn't everything but it sure keeps the kids in touch does it not right on the other sports happy\nAnd that's what we want we want happy squirts\nLadies and gentleman you don't want to see unhappy squirts that's not a good thing okay so we weren't happy squirts anyway this is the time when we talk about estate planning and so we're going to talk about this week the dynasty trust and I think the dynasty trust is one of the most powerful\nEstate planning documents there is I really do and so we can talk about that but before we do it ... can you play it\nYou know I'd\nTo\nSay you\n... may be\nMoving\nAnd\nOf course it is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes in probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite and we don't want that to happen to you so therefore every week at this time we have\nOr a steak tip of the week now this we were going to talk about the dynasty trust which is a kind of trust that will hold the inheritance that you lead to the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs for up to a hundred years\nAnd not only that it'll protected from lawsuits divorce and estate taxes during that entire time so [laughter] wow Mr Spock it is also very logical thing to do I think so let me describe to you the way it works a dynasty trust basically\nIs in its own separate entity okay so it has its own tax id you have to create it\nAnd you can create it during your lifetime while you're living or it can be tested ... which means that it is in your will step on your dad they read the will and it says create the trust that can be done that way as well now the dynasty trust is what you put money into okay now once it's in the trust\nNow what happens is it can stay in that trust as I said for up to a hundred years and during that time it'll be protected from lawsuits and and divorce and estate taxes why\nWell because for example let's say that uh you know your your daughter gets a divorce\nWell your ex son in law is not divorcing to trust he's divorcing your daughter\nAnd so therefore the trust the money that's in the trust inheritance that you left behind is not available to the former son in law or because\nThere's no no no liability they're also in a lawsuit if your child goes bankrupt same thing they're suing your child or not so into trust therefore the trust is immune from that and then also you have a state taxes\nEstate taxes in the end the dynasty trust a ... it's called the generations getting taxed trust because it skips generations when it comes to taxes so it's a very powerful document in that regard\nNow while they're living they have access to the money as trustees your children or whoever you've named as the beneficiaries can receive that money from there and it and therefore they can choose the investments that they want to use and they have access to the money for what's called health education maintenance and support hams H. E. N. S.\nAnd you know hands is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance of sport is pretty much everything right\nSo it is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in in assets that they want to leave behind to they're greedy and washed undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest to you if they are real estate or something like that so talk to your uh financial people\nTalk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff that I think if something ... who can wait or from your\nWell Dorothy I've got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is that if anyone listening to the show right now would like to talk to on a bus or financial advisors about their estate planning their retirement planning then you know I go to our website it as money matters dot net\nAnd on that website you'll have a link there and you can click on it which says I Want to sign up for the next seminar and you can do that and when you're there\nDorothy guess what people will get\nThey will get are now world famous oatmeal raisin and chocolate chunks cookies\nAnd folks did you notice I said chocolate chunks I did not say chip you don't want chocolate chip chips made with ... they form and they formed the chocolate with wax it's gross you weren't real chocolate chocolate chunks\nYou want chocolate that melts all over your face gets on your clothes on your notes and everybody's looking at you like what the heck's wrong with you don't you know how to eat a cookie and you're like no or do you look at our tropic chunk\nAnd while you're at it they're learning about your financial Matty from the deal you can find no we're out of the hour and to go to our website\nMoney matters a net now on the off chance that may be cookies or not what you want to go to us that are for although I Would highly recommend it at the semi we can talk about three of the worst enemies you have to your financial wellbeing we're going to talk about inflation\nGoing to talk about income taxes bear markets we'll also talk about how to calculate your magic number which is a if you have enough money to retire on we're going to talk about your cash\nFlow Matt and maximizing cash flow junior retirement we'll talk about what you should be doing with your four one K. right now we'll talk about when you should take Social Security when you're sixty two sixty six when you're Seventy we're going to talk about the fact that the IRS [noise]\nYeah those guys they want to tax eighty five percent of your Social Security\nBenefits and we know show you how to beat that if it's at all possible we have so much information at the center I Can't even tell you all about it right now but go to our website money matters dot net\nSign up for the seminar and we'll look forward to seeing you there you know what I can not believe how fast the show has gone over already from I Hope you guys enjoyed as much as I enjoy doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nInformation presented should not be regarded as a complete analysis on the subject was not an end to not be construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security has mentioned none of these shows contempt you need you to personalize investment in my\nProfessional advisor city can sell more implementing any of the strategies presented numerous times investments in malls varying degrees of risk and therefore it can be no insurance any specific investment strategy will be suitable profitable for a client was fully tax\nPlanning information on ... on this program is general in nature always insolvent attorney or tax\nProfessionals regarding years that they like legal ...\nFounded ... should not be construed as\nAn endorsement of him or a more N.M W KM advisors and I'll see the from only trends that business these days where he doesn't really registered or is it was looted nor exempted from registration requirements registration is not an endorsement other firms buy securities regulators and does not mean that the headlines\nAre detained particular level of detail more ability\nAnd does not reflect the opinions or policies of K.
