go back and look at them how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight new kind of measure that yet about fifty percent drop Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing\nAnd so if we come to here we say okay here's your that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about uh we uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops in accounting and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand and that happened in one year\nIt ... happened I think it was fourteen months total right that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires they one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the

about generating more income whether its primary income\nWhether it's supplemental income whether it's passive income or whether it's active income and one of the things\nI always like to boil down in my classes Larry's everybody starts with ... with active income and then eventually moves into passive income even if you take the wealthiest people in the world right at one point they were working right above it was out there they call it a buffet he he was going door to door buying stocks for people back in the day even as a kid\nI think I remember reading how he sold bubblegum like on the on the beach at like his family vacations right that's active income\nAnd right now that the common piece of active income that we all that we all generally have is is our job right we'd go out we have that job actively\nWorking to generate income well now we take a little bit about the money we pay our bills and we put some food in our in our stomach and all this fun stuff right and then we should have a little bit of money left over that goes into our retirement account now that retirement account really ends up being that first wave\nTrade people kept them for a range of reasons including

just tuning in just Larry Jacobs director of a structure development and top instructor it on a train\nEconomy really shed some light on consistent returns in the market\nIs one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency in the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental it'd be their primary source of income and I've even heard people\nIf they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this was a primary source of income that's a great\nQuestion right you know what I find that a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over ... fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to kick a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officer we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny I got him Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable to trade wouldn't be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you tie it back to the half day class you know they have to classes or three hours long and say if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by ... percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish this I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month\nAnd that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why ... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this and or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing\nAnd part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time has to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build out the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel they could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be dropped as it could be their stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of the things you always talk about I guess I should say Larry is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we've got a little bit of savings to buy us little time but it ended up being that kind of\nThat that that downward spiral or even just stuck in a rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nYour building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be ah not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability at you know as\nYou're thinking what you're saying and you you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing\nWhich really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh and I say this but with the frog\nIf you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you've covered the box ... a couple of times the frog hits the top lid and he just that little way they still can't jumping the higher the way the lid was\nWe don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least thinking or just definition of of self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagined you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd not only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom and doing the things we want to do rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more of these passes what are you say let's do it right now you have to a class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income whether that's supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks doesn't matter it's all about generating more income\nAnd we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half their classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that great or to not reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these have take classes to get your phone's ready and if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes are professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like in ... strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional inside of kept makes it so you can get started right now\n... through twenty we needed a call now and reserved those seats\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teachers students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else just telling you what you need\nYou you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big ups and the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at um how often they're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of an\nAverage of the we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you got about a fifty percent dropped Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing and so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal but the thing that I went through with my father\nOther about uh we uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight or you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and counseling and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account and they lost fifty thousand in the last fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand and that happened in one year and that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down\nWhen they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now it's a little bit at three hundred percent increase in two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow is get them out to one
