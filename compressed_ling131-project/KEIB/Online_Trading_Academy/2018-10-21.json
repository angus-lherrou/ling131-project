[noise]\n\nAt online training academy our mission is to offer exceptional financial education so you could live the life you've always wanted maybe it's just having that peace of mind so you don't have to worry so much about the bills or even just having the luxury of not working so hard\nTo have more time to spend with the family graduates of online training academy share but there's all kinds of stories here's one one recent graduate had to say\nI bar tended at a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas off and maybe eight years I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different of needed time I needed my life\nAnother student says ... al ... and ... and that's something that I had always wanted to death and sell as I'd I'd die for that particular call or start that changed my life\nLearn more visit us on line that free O T a class on Tom that's free OT a class dot com\n[noise] you're listening to how we're trading radio [noise] welcome back\nIf you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs director instructor development and top instructor it online trading ketamine shed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about generating more money we're talking about generating more\nIncome whether the market's going up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets\nBut when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities degenerate into give generate more income and especially give yourself a raise and it really is important to remember that the more that money is made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of games on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling if you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combined and so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crash there's a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lotta times they are looked at as a a a not so they looked at with not such a pleasant light we could say because\nWhen they made all that money a lot of people were losing money you know a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals though who\nLook at a down market as a bad thing now these individuals that were turning themselves in from millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they had that skill set they had that knowledge they knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money as the markets are going up that's kind of the situation our income in retirement accounts or in if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways\nAnd if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why\nIt's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nBut how much opportunity has been lost on those down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn\nWhere we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how that instead of that\nInstead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money at the market going down we start doubling up on this stuff\nNo absolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand they started trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time and here's why the number one mistake most people making their lives when it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some educational later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shared by Ninety five percent of the population where Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people\nSo that means there was five percent of us who have understood the right way to trade how to make money and what's really scary right now and I talked to a lot of students as I ask them a simple question\nDo you work for more money or just money work for you and most people are working for more money they always believe that they're going to get ahead if they're going to find their freedom and let's face it\nPeople who start trading are people looking for multiple streams of income and most millionaires we discuss this right have a an average five income streams\nThey're doing so not because they're working harder they're working smarter they're figuring out how to work right and what that simply means is if there's a way to learn how to generate income without having to put more effort that's the best way to do it and most of the time\nPeople don't understand that trading us like a system what's the system it stands for save yourself stressed time energy and money love it if you learn how from professionals to do things the right way there's no reason why you can't be generating income as well\nMost people either don't know how to do this or are afraid to do this and honestly they keep going out there in thinking that they're going to attain freedom by working more and more well most people I talked to my students give me an example mc ... used to work in the workplace he quit he want it to work for himself\nHe wanted more time with his family well if you can learn a skill that will allow you to make money the same way the banks do and you've shared district me many times Ryan J. P. Morgan Chase had only nine losing days in the last five years\nI don't know about you guys but I Want to be on that team that keeps making that money and the only way you're going to do that is by investing in the education learning how to do that can you see how this could help lead you to spending more time with family or just leave a job you don't like any more\nYou know so many times individuals get caught up in the rat race and you start hearing people use phrases like time is money right and that that's what you're talking about earlier is is exchanging just time and getting a wage right getting paid for our time now\nThat the thing that we always like to focus on his money is money Ryan how can we make money\nHow can we make money work for us rather than like what you were saying working for working for money and that's really what starts to to to separate\nThe the the financially independent from the financially dependent out there are those multiple streams of income and a lot of that comes from having our money work harder\nThan our body is working and that the whole time is money concept is something that I used to uh\nUh I used to say all the time and I worked for my dad's construction business I had an hourly wage and everything like that and so it was very normal thing for me to to to to to equate time with money but it started getting into investing I I I realized how bad of a mindset that actually is about easy trap to fall into because that's what we've been told our whole lives\nBut we really what we have to focus on is restored and having our money work harder than our body and one of the ways where we can help a few people get started on that later if you're up for it as we can do a quick little give away with some of these tickets we got here let's do some more giveaways right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area that have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really generate that consistent income up down or sideways\nSupplemental income or primary income inside of the financial markets all about how that money work hard rather than your body work hard right\nNow the half day classes about three hours long we called the half the class but you're really going to be investing about three hours of your time\nJulie raise that financial IQ and start generating more income inside of the financial markets and included with your passes to the half the class is going to be our professional insiders kit packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing ... strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kid makes it so you can get started right now\n... when he did a call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nBut there are multiple types of income that we're just kind of touching on there but we have the passive income we have the the active income we have the a supplemental income we have the primary income was kind of a hot topic out there ... ... what do you see most people getting excited about as far as different income streams in the market\nRight now well the biggest thing they're realizing is by we help our students design a financial trading planet blueprint so to speak\nNobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement status perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person has many sleepless nights over money\nBut how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional in the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up uh falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have to class coming up in your area that have to cost ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half the class including with your past is going to be a professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now\n... when he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there now Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside\nBut also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down\nAbsolutely a little out of our students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market is in a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they come to this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students\nStudents like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are frantically waiting for it because it can be one of the best years of our lives\nLike people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something to happen like I said again the cavalry ain't come in\nAnd the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R. it's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so for all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested wouldn't that be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world is restored how what what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or half day classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so so even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time\nWell what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points of return to your your portfolio every year 'cause really your risk is only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to this after class\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio\nAnd imagine that you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your four one K. and you can learn how to reallocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nYou know it goes back to some of those are some of those unquote so we always like to throw out and here as far as you don't have to be a and I'm going to do this one wrong or you take it it's yours ... yeah ... I used to always say you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great\nAnd unless you do oh you just want to Ryan's as you don't want to spend your golden years at the golden arch absolutely I Love that one you know and and it's all the wherever these fun cliches things that we love to throw around but they've been around forever 'cause they're true\nRight we heard him so many times because they are true no nobody ever says well no you you don't have to get started in order to be great you know you do you have to you have to be great you have to get started but you don't have to be great in order to get started right it's awesome and\nAnd I love doing uh I get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity race in a in a couple of days\nAre raising money for cancer and and I always compare it to just a race you have to cross the start line before you can cross the finish line it is necessary right but it is is a lot of fun and trading investing you can take this really whatever level you want but imagine ... imagine if\nImagine if it just made that slightest impact in your life to the positive how worth it with a three hour investment be now before we can get people into class they gotta have tickets we gotta do give away\nLet's do it All right we're right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area\nThat they ... really where you'll be able to see exactly what it takes to keep their retirement account growing whether the markets are going up down or sideways and now including with your passes to have their class is going to be a professional insiders kit\nIt's packed with lessons from some of our top instructors now the professional insiders kit makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there we've got to take a quick break we're going to be right back Larry whatever force next\nYou know let's talk about the lifestyle of a trade or a lot of people now are sitting here may be interested in realizing they want to make\nA change they need to make a change in their lives let's talk about what the effects are making such as they\nWere going to pull back the current issue with that looks like right around the ... we'll be right back [noise]\n\nAt online

can really shut some light on generating more income in the ...\nMark it a lot of times we'll talk about income for today or income for tomorrow me our retirement account income read but really that's what this is all about it's consistent growth whether I'm gonna use it to pay my bills today or whether we're going to disappear bills tomorrow it's all about having that consistent strategy so we can have multiple streams of income multiple streams coming out of the financial markets\nAnd I've taken multiple streams that's one thing that I Love about the financial markets as you can build a stream of income via commodities through derivatives you know there can be a dividend type ... that you build out there's an easy way inside of these financial markets to get to that kind of four or five\nIncome streams are inside of the financial markets or whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listener\nMaybe been with us for the whole show get excited\nThe best is yet to come ... a lot of our listeners are new to the markets and they're just looking to get started off on the right foot and many have been really investing for a while but not really quite reaching their goals and others are doing well\nAnd they're looking to do a little bit better maybe there's a a consolidated message that you could give it to those three or even if you want to address all three of individually that's fine but what what is it that the what's the message that you guys are putting out to those guys right now we'll look the number one mistake that most new traders are experienced traders make as they try to do this on their own very little education\nWhat makes a TA so different\nIt's we simplify trading it just simple step by step investment strategy called the core strategy we ask students can you do this and it's yes and yes so if you're somebody who was looking for an education because it's easy to learn it's perfect for beginners\nIt's perfect for any account size you get to learn and live markets and you can start immediately this is definitely something you want to do its time right now to ask yourself if all this did was teach you how to make some extra money
