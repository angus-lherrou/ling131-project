O. B. have any deal that smiles on your wallet\nBrent is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Brent\nGold card to join you\nWell it's great to have you here brat you have a question for me that is one that gets really difficult to give a solid answer to something to do the best I can\nOkay Yes sir Yes sir yeah I I had a ... a federal ... bankrupt\nAnd that was my question was I was told that that could not take the oil so that after it after it rolled after this totally went into bankruptcy is that correct or should I take that versus\nShould I Do that ... what I call versus the ...\nSo are you still working for the company or you already retired\nAlready retired ...\nAnd are you of an age yet that you're receiving a pension payment every month or is it just sitting there\nIt's just sitting there from sixty three ... quite there yet okay so yeah so yeah\nSo who's telling you that you have no right to take a lump sum a well\nWhat's it goes into bankruptcy I called the ... the capital of the ... the ... so ... to ... to look into this before or a little to bankruptcy\nI guess there's some kind of federal program are so close that protects the employees was the ... of shake her\nYeah so what happens there's a there's a ... a federal agency that as far as I'm concerned as federal agency called the pension benefit guarantee corporation\nAnd when a company goes bust that has pension obligations if they can't honor their obligations they become an obligation of the pension benefit guarantee corporation if you are someone who is working on a moderate\nModerately paid job than the formula that the pension benefit guarantee corporation uses will usually give you pretty much the same pension as you would have had from the former employer if they hadn't gone broke\nIf you on the other hand made big money there and that was the basis for your pension then usually the PG see will reduce your pension benefit below what it would have been otherwise were you making a moderate money or big money\nIt's six figure\nAll right so and so I see why you're concerned because at the level of pension benefit you may well of iron they may um\nDo what they are the terms terrible but cram down your pension check to a smaller amount than it would have been others like if you're if you've been told\nYeah so yeah so that's exactly right yeah [noise] check with the local store so a lot of ... economic\nGuy cat little said is ... ... oh I'm so [noise]\nBut you but that's not available to you\nOr oil [laughter] uh um I I started the ... just before this so I guess I Would say hopefully hopefully it it got a little tired of\nIt and hopefully in fact it did but everything else I said squares with what you've heard\nOkay Yes sir yeah that's exactly right yeah that makes sure yet I was just to have it because it is a\nLittle sickle cell ... so that's that's what I wanted to make sure I understood\nYou are off like calm for somebody who may see your pension eroded right before your eyes so I got to give you credit for that and this is when I talked to someone about their pensions sprint and people will call me who are leaving a job and they'll ask me\nWhether they should take a lump sum or be paid out over time I say that normally you want to be paid out over time unless there's a reason that you're worried about the strains the how strong the employer is and the chances that they are not going to be\nSuccessful over the long term and that's like looking in a a crystal ball that may be cloudy and your case your past that and I'd love it if you let me know if you later are in fact\nIssued your lumps some amount or if you've got to suffer and wait for the PG see to do its thing\nOr list is with us on the Clark Howard show\nHello are less

more of what you make saving for retirement saving for a rainy day and if you have kids and you're likely for them to go to college saving for a kids' college\nSo\nEvery roughly Eighteen months\nI revise my guide to\nThe best five twenty nine plans and the country if you're not familiar with five twenty nine plans\nThey are the tax free plans that allow you to save in many states for private school before college and then for college itself tax free my general recommendation is even if your state allows you\nTo use five twenty nine plan money for private school\nUh up to twelfth grade that you're usually better off if you can afford to to pay for the private school out of your own fines\nOr whatever scholarships your kid may earn in private school and then have more years of tax free grows for college\nBut the plans calm and multiple flavors and they can really overwhelm you and confused you with all the noise in life\nTrying to pick a five twenty nine plant these five twenty nine plans are specifically\nGenerally approved by a state sponsored by a state to state wins its name to a private plan some states have multiple once\nMany states have both an indirect plan where you go through a commission sales person an indirect plans where you invest directly there is never a circumstance and this is a never rule\nThat you should ever go through a commission sales person to put money in a five twenty nine plan\nWhat's the most important thing in saving particularly with the window you have from whatever point after childbirth you decided to start saving money for college Schiller child would enter college\nThe time period the horizon is relatively short if you're paying massive commissions to go into a plan you're going to a road\nThe ability for your money to work for you and build up tax free to pay for a child's college the investment choices I recommend are so simple and a five twenty nine plan that there is absolutely no need for anyone even with minimal knowledge about investing\nTo ever need a sales person help to do a five twenty nine plan in fact the go to choice I recommend in any of the plans that I like that I've talked about on my guide\nAre for you to go in the age based portfolios\nAged base portfolios or where you put money in and based on your child's age or grand kids age or niece or nephew or whoever you're putting up the money for\nThat the mix of investments changes as the child gets closer and closer to entering college\nIt's too complicated to try to figure out your own investment ... mix unless you work as an investment professional as your day job", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "16"}
