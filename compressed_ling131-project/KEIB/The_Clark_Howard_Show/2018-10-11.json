a real\nCollector craze for this car even though it's a a Nineteen eighty eight and the cars now valued at forty thousand dollars and I'm I'm\nLiterally wait wait what did that luxury vehicle cost to buy new in Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Nineteen eighty eight I bought it for I'm Sorry Ninety three I bought it for thirty five I understand it eighty eight it costs fifty thousand\nSo now you fast forward the clock and now it's getting back to what it originally cost all those decades ago\nIt's it actually it it hit a low of Eighteen five\nAnd then about three or four years ago that went crazy and people started collecting a light nuts and I I think it's actually worth like forty six but I'm just going to sell it for forty but I'm looking at offers from a\nNew York and North Carolina and a here locally um but I I don't know how what is a safe way to get payment from these people\nLive wire transfer\nJust wire transfer\nYeah cashier's check means nothing okay and so we have two sides of this let's say you were calling me as the buyer in New York and you're trying to uh ...\nYou're trying to buy the vehicle and I'd say well you got to be really careful buying it because how do you know it's really in the condition the sellers telling you how do you know Albert's not playing games with you I you know you really even owns one and all that so this is an area where when people buy\n[noise] I'm old collectors cars\nFrom across the country it's a very difficult process to protect yourself a lot of people do it by going through the ... motors platform and I actually sold\nA

wire ... that's if you do a C.

Z. I. N. us mattress that or heavy sellers on Walmart dot com and Amazon dot com\nAnd he said it's it's just the greatest that the mattress is fantastic queen size on Amazon today it's two hundred twenty eight dollars\nOn Walmart one hundred Ninety nine dollars yeah and I'm so these things move around in price a lot all the time but the point is wet Casper started\nThe idea of ... pressing a mattress so could fitness smaller box that you could have delivered right to your door by\nA traditional delivery service like fed ex or UPS instead of waiting for some mattress company to come with a big truck and deliver your mattress the ability for you to go into\nCostco wholesaler Sam's Club and buy a mattress in a box that you could just put in the back they're all designed this is so funny they're all designed to be able to fit\nOn the back seat of a Honda Civic and that's like the classic example of the size they have to be\nIn order for you to be able to get these things home they're special instructions with all these competitors about how you open\nThe box and how you release the mattress and then it takes shape and it kind of blows up right before your eyes\nAnd the all these mattresses although the exact policy may vary company to company but typical policy whether you buy from a direct seller you buy from one of the big boxes you buy from a any third party\nGenerally you have usually a three month period to reject the mattress for any reason\nAnd get a full refund\nAnd the mattress business is one that had really been stuck\nIn a very uh sleazy era for a long time the mattress business often referred to as a step worse than buying a used car\nAnd the reason is is it there was very high pressure you could never figure out the models you could never figure out the quality the pricing a it was a terribly difficult thing to buy one then you'd spend\nA huge amount of money on something and if you hated it you are stuck with it so then this business model of buying one sight unseen but with the unconditional right for\nA period of time to return it is taking more and more market share by the week\nAnd the traditional way of buying mattresses will not become irrelevant but it will become only one possibility out of many ironically enough Casper\nIs now opening actual physical stores\nSo that people who want to go see one in person before they buy it can do that just a small number of them very much like ... Parker is done with eye glasses were ... Parker first was only on line and now has physical stores\nAre but not a lot of those either but for people who want to go see frames and get a sense in person they can go do that and so this idea just like Harry's the the razors", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "11"}
