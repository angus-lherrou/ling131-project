I'm\nNot the wisest person when it comes to computer technology nor am I with consumer math but I'm In a situation where um they took it to ... to start working so uh friends and co workers at me we'll try to go find me thing will happen to be on the uh Facebook\nCommunicating with these people and uh\nThis took place not saying well Facebook's got one set up an account and immediately uh people I Know a a ...\nStarted contributed and all there that I thought well wait to see how it's supposed to get the money [noise] well what I did that then is to ask me for my bank routing address and everything and I feel very uncomfortable with just with this situation especially with all the hacking that has taken place with Facebook and most recently as well\nYou know that's the thing to do with ah with the bigger players go find me and the smaller imitator the Facebook finding option or you have to give your checking account so they have the place to put your money into\n... and I did uh did uh go fund me as well that's what I have actually given any either one of 'em a banking information of course I was waiting to consult with you as a fall and you for years appreciate your glass\nAbsolutely so first things first I Hope that you get the insulin pump as quickly as possible\nAnd second with both of them go ahead and give them your checking account information because that's how you're going to get money the way it works is you don't get the money minus their credit card merchant processing fees that bell charge right\nSo what happened was go find me use to their business he used to be based on charging a percent\nTo people for having to go find me page plus the credit card merchant processing phase now they are laminated um the money that they were getting in fundraising campaigns and all they do is charge you\nFor their costs would the credit card companies and that's exactly what Facebook is doing also\nDid look very similar there um\nWhen I looked into the details of the F ... it was very compatible in what they were doing a most\nPeople let's say with the job I felt a lot more comfortable with the ... of ah do find me a there's just so many people are used that successfully but I could not get any feedback at the time from Facebook's for a fundraiser Programme I\nNut known anybody that had used it\nI'd never and our first person I've ever heard of who use [laughter]\nAnd I see my uh ... the manager at the credit union using that use credit unions that again through your advice several years back uh as opposed bikes but yeah that's I told her she so odd that were like anything to kill us just ... will probably you probably like a little bit more money than I Do\nKnow that that is generally good advice and the fact that you're being skeptical is the right thing because you don't want to willy nilly ever handout your checking account number your bank routing and checking account number to anybody but new rice you gotta and I hope that your campaign\nIs solid and successful and you get the medical care that you need to keep you healthy Jim joins us on the car coward show hello Jim\nClark thanks for taking my call\nAbsolutely Jim how can I serve you well\nI'm a a few years from a retirement I work for a non charity or a non profit and um [noise] I have a full throated me and a traditional i._r._a.\nAnd a couple of other sources of income that will lead Layla bowl and I'm retired but I keep getting emails from an organization that uh\nIs is pushing something called an infinite banking concept and I can't find out anything about it except that it looks like it's tied to a [noise] a David and paying your whole life insurance\nYeah yeah I got it and they'll\nPut them on that for a you don't like that for insurance and I I just didn't know it was a a viable thing for retirement income\nYou know I don't like this at all\nAnd it was something that has been patched so many different ways in recent years I've had a lot of calls recently that people have referred to it as a seven oh two Jay ... and things like that where where the people pitching this stuff make it sound like it's magical then it's like a loophole\nIn the tax code or whatever and life insurance does have a in certain circumstances some tax advantage to it but the problem with using whole life insurance\nAs a vehicle to find some amount of retirement is that the expenses and commissions involved with the whole life insurance policy or so gigantic\nThen the fish and sea of your money is not very good there's such a focus on if you do this you're going to avoid tax\nIf that's the whole big pitch but one thing you mentioned you said you're doing a regular IRA\nDo you know what so superior to this strategy that it's being pitched around whole life insurance and on any time somebody calls me and asked me about\nUsing whole life insurance is a way to pay for retirement and I'll ask more you fully finding a Roth IRA\nRoth IRA beads any life insurance policy three hundred and sixty five days this year because there's only three sixty five is not a leap year leap year and beat at three hundred and sixty six days\nSo your darling you're doing good strategies the only modification I Would make is instead of contributing to a regular IRA anymore I was instead contribute to a Roth IRA\nPull out uh if if I only have like two years or so to retire lend is that going to pay off\nWell I don't know how much money you would put into a whole life insurance policy right\nWell I'm not going to do that at all\nOkay but if you worry if you were considering and and you were thinking of doing that whatever money you would have potentially put into that put that instead into a raw you put it aside up to your past age fifty\nSo you put in up to sixty five hundred dollars max but ... whatever you can afford into a Roth and the fact that you're approaching retirement doesn't take away from the advantage of a raw is where a Roth\nIs so great is its flexibility you put money in it you retire you're not working anymore but the money in their can continue to grow tax free for years and years and years to come until maybe later in retirement when you need it and then you spend it tax free\n... let's see so that's why the Ross early so you\nWere Enron man that I put my could put in sixty five hundred a year and the traditional would you recommend that I just stopped that if I can do to stop that and put it into law\nExactly okay\nExactly cause you already are doing the fourth repeat plan you're doing a lot of pre tax stuff so I Want you to have some post tax money\nComing to an end [noise] you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n\n[noise] and official methods for Medicare open enrollment thin

pleasure to welcome you to the Clark Howard show where it's about you learning ways to save more spend less and don't let anyone ever rip you off you think somebody is about to rip you off you had a question you've got a\nProblem we're here to help and we do so off the air as well over forty hours each week you can talk with a member of team car for nothing we've been doing this for twenty six years answering your questions off the air if you scroll down\nWith a cart dot com you'll see the phone number or an hours available for free off the air advice\nOn TALK about something that I had so many questions about\nDuring the great recession don't get as many questions about resumes as I used to and there's such a change and how particularly larger companies treat a resume\nCompared to how they were treated in the past also job applications that are filed electronically how they're treated by employers okay this is weird weird weird\nBigger companies that either except electronic applications written ones or resumes\nHave them scanned by software almost exclusively on at least the first round never reviewed by human\n'cause big companies that people know of and are aware of get ... billions of applications\nAnd they don't want to spend the time or the labor looking through them so they have them scanned for key words based generally on the skill set of the job they're hiring for\nAnd so and you can find lots of this information online about how the key word should be position\nBut you want to make sure you're using industry terminology it relates to the job that you're applying for if you're doing something in the IT field or tech\nWhatever I'm\nCertification initials you have whatever skills you have whatever training you've had that's gotta be prominently and clearly written on an electronic application a written one or a resume to be picked up by the scan to get through the first cut\nBut here's a dirty little secret you need to know particularly with larger employers\nFixes in most jobs are what's called wire the applicant they intend to hire for that job is already known before their job is posted\nYou are given false hope in most cases they're actually interested in you even if you make it through the electronic cuts may be a human review somebody calls you for a phone interview recalls you in for an in person interview and you think wow this is great\nI'm On my way to working here and all on\nTheir playing you because they're just trying to meet the requirements that HR is laid out for them at these big companies\nThat they show that they've had a diversity of applicants before they made their final hiring decision who's the person they intended to higher before the job was ever posted in any way\nThe key thing for you when you're looking for a job or a new opportunity people hire people\nForget the machines it is the rare exception that somebody makes it through that clutter to get a job when it was not a situation already wired you need to be the one that jobs wired for\nAnd the most important thing when you're looking for work ignored the giant employers pay or slow growth entities many times actually reducing headcount over time the larger company gets the less dynamic it becomes\nAnd the real growth and jobs the real opportunity comes with smaller generally potentially faster growing firms that nobody's ever heard of", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "30"}
