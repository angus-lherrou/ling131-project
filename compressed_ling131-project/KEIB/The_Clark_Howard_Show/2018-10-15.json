we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte to do he indicated that he would do that so now's the time obviously to get that done and that sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there\nTo answer these important questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between midnight and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen where he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions under oath\nWill take a quick break come back we'll continue also more coverage of hurricane Michael pounding the panhandle

Trey Gowdy is office and chairman good last office and say call these men and demand that\nThey subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why that would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context so possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell hopefully I I Would I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number ... holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it you're listening interest and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understand how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today\nOr to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that\nThe deputy attorney general much caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final Pfizer warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI have not uh Shaun we need to see that we need to see it and don't take an after every time Bruce or goes in and talks with the FBI I remember Mr or told us\nThat after each conversation he had with Glenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact person that the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know there are at least twelve those\nSo the so called real too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about the classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications for Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include McKay number so we we need all that information and again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see it more important the American people need to see\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero people I please too old to two to five six oh three oh a chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five\nFifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but I think with all that's going on they should demand that he testify under oath\nWell thank you so much congressman Mark Meadows thank you congressman Jim Jordan and we appreciate your push for the truth we need to get to the bottom of the ... [noise]\nAll right we've got to take a break when we come back we've got a lot more to come ... more on this also the latest on this hurricane that is pounding the Florida Panhandle as we speak hurricane Michael I'm much more Hannity tonight nine eastern on the Fox news channel we got a great show will tell you about that in a minute\nThis is the best of the best this is the Sean Hannity show [noise]\n\nHave some exciting news simply say home security is now valued at one billion dollars and when this company first started on this show they only had six people working together you know the founder only started the company because he wanted to help his friends\nWho are victims of some type of burglary and that was simply say protects over two million of us will simply say home security is comprehensive protection for your home round the clock professional monitoring and police dispatch you get protection against intruders fires leaks busted pipes\nAnd simply say keeps working during power outages\nAnd even down why pie and even if a burglary matches your key pad their system is simple to use incredibly intuitive\nOnly takes ... minutes to set up and was simply said no contractor so I Know hitting the at all you get twenty four seven monitoring for only fourteen Ninety nine a month and right now because you listen to this program you save an additional ten percent off your simply safe system is going to simply say Hannity dot com simply save Hannity dot com you'll say ten percent\nTo prevent\nA fake individual fake fake but a fraud stir from being able to get at your money and we will see more and more things implemented like that if you're a vanguard customer you can set up the system with vanguard at vanguard my voices my password\nNow I've said that on the air you're going to try to go in and steal my money from vanguard aren't you\nDebbie is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Debbie\nHi there how are you oh I'm pretty good you're thinking of doing some real estate investing is that right yes kind of a roundabout way [laughter] what are you waiting of doing [noise] well\nWhat it is is I had a little bit of money and um and and my mother just showed um her home\nAnd she has\nSaid so I had heard about this on on on the radio site\nAnd that's the same channel that I hear you want [laughter] and they were advertising and that's it and invest in it and then it's a whole bunch of people together and then they enemy is dating games by stores and things like that that have excellent credit and and\nNow I Know it kind of talk I never I never shy about All right so\nThis is a private placement real estate deal where you go in with other people and you own a shopping centers or store locations or restaurant locations or whatever and you owned the real estate but not what's known as a publicly traded\nInvestment it's a form of\nWhat's referred to as a real estate investment trust and Ari IT\nOkay and with these what happens in a rate is the idea of them is that a bunch of people go together putting their money together and they can own a number of different\nPieces of real estate or types of real estate right what's different in this case and this is somebody has been a more and more popular is that these are like private gatherers of money so you can't go to\nA stockbroker and say you know I don't want to own that read anymore and then ten minutes later you don't own it any more\nWhen you buy and you own the big concern I have with any of the private offerings are the fees that you have to pay\nOkay and the fees\nTo get in or usually high enough like somebody's got to pay for that marketing that you heard on the radio station fees may make it not a good decision to go into I mean you got you got the two things one once you're in you can't just hop out\nOkay and to you got to look at the expenses so my preference in this what we're talking about here\nIs almost certainly not a scam\nBut I think there are better ways to do what you were interested in and that is buying what's known as a ... index fight where you own little pieces of many many different\nOwners of real estate that might on shopping centers office buildings hotels you know full office parks whatever and so I like that more where your money is really spread out\nAcross the country and across lots of different places and you can buy and sell those instantly and you can own it it almost no cost for the management of the real estate\nOh okay I get that answer some each month or so what\nHappens with depends on if you go in a retreat or ... index fund so if you buy an actual publicly traded real estate investment trust they pay you back over time the uh the money you've invested and\nPotentially any earnings they're having\nIf you own I'm a ... index like I'm I just pulled one up while we're talking and like here's one that twelve percent of it is and medical buildings\nSick or sense and hotels I'm six percent is an industrial buildings\nFourteen percent is in office buildings sixteen percent isn't apartments I mean that's you know and that's what they do they divide out all different buildings all different types\nAnd that way you're not subject to the risk of any one industry\nOkay and\nThere are many of these available you can buy I'm going to throw another term as you besides ... which is Ari IT up all the other is ATF exchange traded fund\nThat's how you would buy one of these you can many of them you can buy for free you know no commission going in and they'll commission going out and then just very very low management expenses each and every month\nOkay and that kind of safe compared to stock market [laughter]\nWell it it is a just a different form of investing you know real estate you asked somebody and oh five of real estate was safe everybody would tell you it was the greatest by oh nine people would say it's a nightmare right right and so it's all about diversifying what you do\nThis stock market is only risky in the short term not in the long term owning real estate is risky and the short term but not necessarily on the long term gotcha\nSo going into a private placement and you know a a private venture where you own different buildings that a lot riskier than owning a wide real estate investment trust to read because the money is not is diversified and\nYou're stuck with them if later you want to be done with them and that makes me very uncomfortable with one that's not publicly traded\nMates with us on the Clark Howard show how are you doing ...\n... or your car great thank you you want to talk about your child what's the story\nYou know I sat down the other day after listening ear show and I was going to freeze my child's credit but got gears turning and wondered if it would be a good thing to open a credit card in their name before doing that and the reason that a idea came up is when I was young and getting my first\nCar loan I had no credit just like everybody else does so I thought maybe I could use the credit card in their name responsibly so then when they got all the age to need credit they could sort of hit the ground running with already having a a good history\nSo I just kind of wondered what you thought about that\nWell I liked the idea especially if your kid doesn't have possession of the card how old is your child\nBut I have a nine year old a seven year old a four year old so no they won't be using the card\nYeah I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about it yet they're too young to even to worry about establishing credit and the way this tablets and credit will work and let's say a decade\nCould be very different than it is today there's a lot of computer modeling that's being tested\nWhere the ability to grant credit will no longer necessarily be based on somebody having credit it can be based on things like how somebody does paying apartment rent or like the cell phones we were just talking about how somebody does paying a cell phone bill\nNight you're white white smile will have your friends talking about how great you look try at risk free one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine\nThat's

under billions in debt\nThe question now kind of smaller seers be viable the reorganization expected to have rippling effects the operator at Kmart and fears already closing hundreds of locations and putting other famous brands on the block as it burns through money and sees customers a band\nIn its stores thoughts as ... as Fox News [noise]\n\n\n\nGlad you're with us here on the Clark Howard show where it's about learning ways to keep more of what you make [noise]\nWe have a spot of five family plan [noise]\nAnd so we pay\nIf I remember right it's Fifteen dollars a month and all of his share the one spot five membership I say all of us I don't really listen to music so\nIt's wasted on me\nBut it's something that we do as\nIndividuals in the family where each of us have our own playlists and it's all part of the one master subscription versus paying a typical one person membership for ten bucks same thing goes on with Netflix where we pay for being able to have multiple streams at a time\nAnd on YouTube TB we pay for the ability to have multiple streams at once each of us have our own\nUnlimited DVR and spot if I\nGot all fired up that people were pretending to be family sharing a membership\nInstead of getting ten bucks a person a month they were getting three bucks a person I'm a ... actually a little less and so spot if I started cracking down\nAnd using a location ability to figure out that one person was over here and somebody else was over there and they couldn't possibly both be living under the same roof so they were in violation there was a huge backlash and spot if I back down\nThe reality is the right answer for all of this is how Netflix handles Netflix does not care who you consider to be part of your family they handle it by limiting how many streams you can have at a time\nAnd part of their whole economic system is planning for that so to them it doesn't matter if one of us on the west coast is watching it and one of us on the east coast is watching it\nThat we're all part of the family membership Netflix offers a much cheaper membership it was just one person\nSpot if I has created part of its own problem by making a one person membership so much money more than three times what it is effectively per person on a family membership\nSo there's no way that companies are going to be able to please what an individual considers to be the members of their family group\nAnd one person is paying the bill\nSo know that most providers know this except it and that as a family group you should look to see is there a way for you to do this as a family membership and save money on whatever streaming service it is\nI think about though the difficulty for people who operate and old media traditional pay TV packages wherever you get them\nThey're required everyone being at one physical location and obviously that business model is over\nKelly's with this on the car is Howard show hello Kelly\nHi Kelly how may I be of service to you\nWell my dad listen you all the times I think it is anyone could get me an email I'm but I'm In my collection after college and and check on channel ... hey independence my bachelor's degree I think I tried to make every outlet and I just don't have any more options and like\nI Can't get any financial aid because my dad took out the lump sum when he retired and it looks like ... making more than he actually is and they refused to sign on the line with me and that they didn't give me any financial aid um they only offered me sixty nine hundred dollars in student loans for the air\nUm and my tuition is twenty eight thousand dollars so\nI'm Wondering I got there twenty eight is that a state school at twenty eight or is that a private university at twenty eight\nIt's out of state",
