results of\nCathy's with us on the car coward show Hi Cathy\nClark how's it going it's going well how are you doing\nWonderful thank you which is very important that we are both doing well when you want to ask me about long term care insurance right\nExactly so what's your scoop\nWell I'm I Am sixty five my fiance is sixty seven we're both retired and we're getting married and congratulations\nThank you and we had a meeting last its financial planners to get health planning for our financial need during our retirement and to um [noise]\nWell looking at it as in any state planning tax planning and that sort of thing and we want to make sure that you know either one of us at the net income in the end of our gas and we don't want to be tried families and so on\nAnd on and what are they for if you're not going to be a burden on your family in\nFact the right [laughter] so in that way you know we didn't pay it with um [noise] you know the issue of long term care and insurance and it's it's really expensive um and so\nWe were just wondering if he might have any suggestions or you know this is this a real problem\nAnd because generally you have a segment of the population that doesn't need long term care and that's people who have a very large number of assets generally north of three million dollars okay\nAnd then people who don't need long term care because they got nothing they don't own a home you know they're renters they have a very little money saved they've got no investments so there's this group of people in the middle that don't have millions of dollars in assets\nAnd to have some things like maybe owning a home and other accounts they don't want to be impoverished by long term care and you mentioned not a burden on the family so if you're in that middle section and would you say that you and your fiance are in that middle\nI Would say that we're in that middle\nYou you do have to think through what in the world are you going to do if one of you ended up needing assistance with what's known as life's daily activities needed long term care needed a assisted living for nurses skilled nursing home what do you do and [noise]\nThe market offers am perfect answers and so the long term care insurance will generally pay for a three to five year period depending on what you buy\nIt will have an inflation adjustment to deal with medical cost inflation over the years the premiums are not guaranteed they can go up\nAnd even initially you're looking at several thousand dollars a year aren't you\nSo it is one of those things there is no good answer\nOr their strategies people do where they go see an elder law attorney and title assets in a way that the assets are not at risk it's considered to be a um a a strategy that some people don't like the ethics of others are happy with\nOr you are you by the long term care insurance\nOkay [noise] um I read on line at out an option regarding investing in community care\nUm [noise] it it it I get the idea that it's basically investing in you know I can ... care facility where\nThe the life stages ones yeah you go in and independent living\nAnd then as your needs change you move from place to place but they they don't provide that care for free I mean you go into a state a facility that deals with the stages of aging you're still gonna have to pay\nFor the care right so it doesn't relieve the the cost burden so if you if the two of you want to make sure that you're not a burden to each other and you're not a burden to your kids and you're both healthy now\nAs much as it hurts to write a several thousand dollar check a year\nI Believe it or not I recommend it\nOkay\nBut I Want you to get a five year benefit if you can afford it and the decent inflation adjustment which would usually be minimum three percent per year\nCovering inflation over the years 'cause a benefit to you today is sixty five let's say you wouldn't need any kind of assistance to your eighty five\nRight if you don't if you don't have inflation adjustment of benefit that looks good today will be useless Twenty years now but I Do have one other alternative\nOkay going back to age eighty five you can buy something known as longevity insurance is anybody mentioned is not at all\nGenerally nobody mentions it because the commissions on it or not very good okay so you can buy a policy that only pays a benefit if you make it to age eighty five and then at age eighty five it pays a fair each interests monthly benefit for the rest of your life\nAnd so it's money you can live on in the event you need any kind of long term care is therefore you die before age eighty five poof it goes up in smoke\nOkay but it's a very affordable way for you to find much later in life when the odds would be higher than you would need care\nAnd so I'm like the longevity policies as an alternative you'll have to work around on your own you probably want to look for a fee only financial planner\nBecause commission oriented sales people won't want to talk to you about it\nAngel is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Angela\nArielle\nGood thank you you want to make sure that your kid knows how to handle a huge amount of money some day is that right [laughter] Dale what's his story\nParents during right right\nI mean I had a thirty year old and we just want to figure out a way that we can help her sorry I said now said that he had a twenty Twenty one that she saw she has enough money to do is she wants the oil\nAnd I ...\nI'm ... years ago talk about um ... all the children have started saving at an early age and he said that starting them out each year by the time they were in the early twenties that they could be there for the kid on a refresh my memory is so\nWell actually I'm going to burst your bubble they can contribute what I talked about is that they if a young kid certainly H Fifteen certain squinting aside two thousand dollars each year they can do that until they're in their early twenties\nAnd never put in another penny and by old age there'll be a millionaire\nOr call\nWhy can't you can't aside money for a nine year old a little bit each

we're going to address in the United states and that is our food supply is coming from everywhere\nThere's something I'll give it to the Igs example when I'm Talking to a school group something like that\nAs a way to really get their attention I say you know it was really easy when I was a kid not to have to eat vegetables all the time or eat fruit all the time because we only had fruits or vegetables when it was in season\nNow and they got really interested in that now because we live in a worldwide food market\nIt seems that things are in season all the time that whatever fruit or vegetable you want is pretty much available twelve months a year without food chain we now have has come with the added complexity that people can get sick\nWho source of the illness hard to track\nAnd keeping people safe has become so much more difficult so we'll have these outbreaks of of foodborne illness\nAnd you can have fatalities you can have illnesses that can go on for a significant period of time before the CDC or whoever else is asleep on the case can track down the source and shut it off\nYou'll hear from time to time happened with lettuce or spinach or whatever well\nThe nation's largest grocer Wal Mart\nWill have a new system fully implemented in less than a year where with any food item sold in the store there will be full\nFarm to store tracking real time so if there's ever anything a dinner fired as a potential source of illness it will be able to track down a whole lot quicker\nAnd the recall will happen a whole lot faster and the danger to people will be greatly reduced we cannot make a food supply a hundred percent safe\nBut what Wal Mart is doing is great in any number of large players\nIn the food industry both manufacturers because it can also be\nDo people get sick from things other than produce you know give me actual um\nCanned food or or processed food they can make people sick as well and so food manufacturers are part of this process also and John who\nIs part of our cart dot com crew recently was in a store with what were you buying\nA frozen shrimp frozen shrimp\nAnd it is okay to name the store in this case it was it sure is target and so you get to the register at target\nAnd they asked would you like to have a red card today first thing you were asked when you get up there right now we're no they don't say that would you like to say five percent on your purchases today and everyday moving forward by having a target red card\nYeah yeah we got that first though we had a we had a a massive a bug you had the kids with this sort of course it's very difficult to go to\nTarget or any other store without a spinning off a lot of money or below it was really interesting and this was Sunday I thought you know the shrimp cocktail it'd be good to have to have with the football games in the afternoon\nOr picked up this bag of shrimp that was on sale took it up and as the associates scan the shrimp or there was an abnormal sound or you know not the normal ah so I looked at the screen or the associate with looking at and it said a do not sell this item\nOr an it printed out a little ticket it's a ... attached to this to the bag of shrimp and column manager or and so the manager came over and a U.S but you know what this could possibly be and she said we really don't know we all we looked at the
