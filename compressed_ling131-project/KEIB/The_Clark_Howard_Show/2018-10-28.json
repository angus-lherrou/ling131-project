a little fat or in your wallet and to me a dollar is important at all times but I wouldn't be me I didn't feel that way right\nAmy's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Amy\nHi Clark thank you for taking my call sure how are you doing I'm doing well thank you\nSo you have a bit of a conundrum that let's see if I can be of help to you\n[laughter] yeah actually it's my daughter who um seems to have lost her birth certificate and her Social Security card and um I Am wondering um what ... what what to offer her in terms of like\nWell the most important thing that would be an immediate move is to freeze her credit file if she has not done that yet\nYeah we she's done that\nSo if she's done those things you cannot change the Social Security number there's almost no circumstances where the Social Security administration will change or number so for her if is it possible the card was stolen\n[noise] I mean it's not it it's\nI think there's a small chance that it was it wasn't um it ... it in\nThis place and it might have been misplaced in a place where somebody could have picked it up and taken at\nOkay so it's really hard to know so I I guess I just wanted to make sure that in the event somebody does have that that um you know we figure out what to do to try to prevent something from happening\nWhere you know I talk about credit freeze is something I Want everybody to do anyway\nBut hurricane credit freeze is very valuable because with the information if the information from the birth certificate\nAnd the Social Security card with its number on it if those two items fell in the hands of a criminal that's like opening it up wide for identity theft and applying for creditors if\nThey're her applying for um service with companies as if they're her and so by having the credit frozen it's like the perfect\nExample of how to deal with the perfect storm of key personal information being out there\nSo there may not really anything else for her to do other than by when the time comes that she needs to follow her credit for some purpose is I Would like her to sign up with credit karma and credits sesame\nSo that she got monitoring going on at at all times\nWhat's going on with their stuff both of those are free to use you can't set up with them while you're credits frozen though\nMhm so yeah she actually she does have a credit card accounts oh\nGood good that's great so that will have an ability to monitor anyway and she's got it frozen so the monitoring is really if somebody were able somehow to defeat their credit freeze system and so she's done where she should and\nYou know getting a new copy of her birth certificate it's very easy and most jurisdiction huh and the replacement Social Security cards not hard either so getting new documents that it's not hard it's worrying about what somebody might do\nWith the documents that were misplaced that's the part that aggravate\nOkay and that's basically those are basically the things that she has to do and and she doesn't have to notify um you know the Social Security um office or um any of those any official office or you\nKnow and how old is she\nShe's twenty nine\nYeah so that's not really an issue you know if we're if she were in her fifties or early sixties\nAnd her Social Security card had gone missing I Would recommend a process was Social Security where you can set up or something called my Social Security were you able to monitor that nobody is attempting to do an application to Social Security but it twenty in our twenties that's not an issue\nOkay great so she's great great thank you very much for your life\nAnd best to her and it sounds like a situation that could be messy she's well protected by having that credit freeze already there generally is with us on the car coward show Hi Kimberley\nHi Clark how're you doing\nI'm doing well how are you good\nKimberly I'm so glad to have you here because I have had quite a bit of feedback and the two occasions that I've talked about people doing their own a tease straightening\nAnd you have a perspective on that that you wanted to make sure that listeners heard about the idea of buying one of these at\nHome she's straightening cuts\n[noise] yeah absolutely um being a business manager for a dental office you know there there are issues around direct to consumer oriented on it we all see that I really feel like the vast majority of kicked him or may not be aware of\nTo hit us with 'cause you're gonna share as the perspective of when things go wrong 'cause I hear plenty from people\nWho use the at home a T straight nurse that are thrilled with the result but I'm not hearing from the people who you are privy to tell me what kinds of things are fouling people up\nShore so it's not the appliance itself the appliance\nStructurally is going to be very similar if not identical to a clear outline or that you would get from your dentist orthodontist a worthy issues come in and we're we've seen all health issues and in some cases costly oral health issues not to mention painful it really comes from the liner itself\nBut the active straightening a patient's teeth without the ... percent supervision of a dentist orthodontist\nAnd so what kind of uh things make people vulnerable ... or using these at home a T straightening cuts\nYeah yeah that's a great question [laughter] ah you know really any oil health issues and particularly a oral health issues that haven't been diagnosed so the big one is going to beat gum disease or particularly\nAdvanced gum disease or you know so any time with with gum disease involved or if there's really any number of procedures that a patient would need things like feelings or a root canal or crown that hasn't been diagnosed and hasn't been done\nOr you can cause severe damage to your tea um\nWhat brought this issue up for me as a patient in or hit on his treated a adult patient\nWho is a front teeth torso loose adult permanent ... or so loose and looked like I was watching a video of a child losing ... shocking um but that patient had advanced disease I just didn't know it [noise] so\nLet me ask a question Kimberly if somebody is going to a dentist for teeth cleaning and exams on a regular basis twice a year they're going to be aware already aren't they that they would have gum disease\n[noise] yes and that's more of the ideal candidate you know if you're going to do or sit on it treatment without the direct supervision of a dentist or hit on it you want to have been regularly see you're done is to ensure that your\nMouth it's healthy enough for that so that the exact uh you you know in most cases that can help mitigate problem ah you know however there can still be issues that come up just in the process of straightening T that even if you've been cleared by her dentist\nYou can still have issues I'm One of the bigger ones that I care about and I talked\nTo a patient last week about is she she kept describing it neither her teeth or cleaning and banging together and the more that I talked to I realized that what she was saying she Dario uncomfortable painful what she was saying she can't close her upper and lower\nTeeth are so that's another part important part of the or is it on at process it's\nHarder to really address you know when you're not seeing a patient in person is not just straightening their teeth but a lining their teeth so they stick together comfortably\nWhen the patient closes or a mouse a you know anything like that that might require a dance treatments or you know or other load allergies to address it's just a lot harder to pick up on when you're working remotely with these companies\nWell I appreciate that perspective very much and you know we've had a lot of strong feedback from people and the dental industry and that uh that it doesn't\nAt all share the full story when I talk about people doing this and why they're doing and how much money they're saving that you've got a perspective it's very clear that people can have harm\nWhen all they're trying to do is strengthened their teeth that the consequences can be more severe than they

advice is available each weekday\nSo over the years I've talked about how insurers use credit scores is a bigger and bigger factor in how they set rates for a variety of insurance products particularly auto when homeowners\nNow I can add to that that another factor insurers are using to either stick it to people or reward them\nThe ZIP Code that you live in there was a study just completed by the consumer federation of America that found enormous differences from ZIP Code ZIP Code and this is something a particular interest to me\nBecause at one point my wife and I lived in a house there was at a corner where three ZIP codes met I mean isn't that crazy when the postal service through the ZIP codes if I stepped one way I was in\nThe second ZIP Code if I stepped in another way I was in the third ZIP Code and in my driveway I was in the ZIP Code that was our official one\nAnd according to what the consumer federation of America found there can be differences\nOf hundreds and hundreds of dollars typically four hundred dollars\nFor taking that step across per year and what you pay for auto insurance or homeowners insurance that there was a really I shouldn't say that specifically the study was of auto insurance just stepping across the street\nAnd\nNot all insurers do things the same way there not a monolith\nBut insurers routinely will use\nCredit scores as a minor factor or a big factor and setting rates ZIP Code is a small or big factor in setting rates and cause neither of these things have anything to do with your driving record\nYour age male female they have nothing to do with the historical factors of setting rates it means that for the same human being\nThe price differences from insurance to ensure or the widest gaps that have ever existed\nSo now you could be someone who has never had a ticket or hadn't had one in recent years my last ticket was in Nineteen Ninety three\nOh pretty good street guarded by without a ticket I I don't want that street to run out and I can't remember the last time I was in an accident\nYou know it's been a long time anyway so\nThose things how I drive you'd think that would be how it would be determine what I'm going to pay the tax credit score is going to be giant with many insurers and the ZIP Code a little dry so for you\nShopping around where you already know what kind of driver you are you just need to quote the same level of coverage is that you have now and by the way raise that the doctor but when you go to shop typically do a thousand dollars\nYou may say hey what am I going to do I don't have a thousand dollars or something goes wrong well here's the thing you make small claims on auto insurance\nYou now have a mark of shame that makes it difficult for you to shop around and is likely to lead to big increases in their premiums you pay with who you're then stuck with\nSo you want to use auto insurance when you got something relatively bigger that you have to deal with not something relatively small\nEnough different companies they can quote to you that they'll be able to guide you best\nPerfect perfect yeah we've got some phone number is already from friends that

parent\nThank you what'd you have a little girl and what's her name Nora Nora oh that's beautiful name thank you well how can I be of service\nTo doesn't Eighteen as men in pretty good and busy year I'm of recently changed jobs and a lady some improvements there are just bought a house or obviously the baby but my question is\nThe job I have they offer a decent four one K. plan that I can kind of micro manage myself through one of the major providers for four one K. and I was kind of wondering\nWhat kind of direction I could go in there without kind of thought in the big hindrance along the things I mean I'm thirty six I'm not really like had a four one K. until now so I Want to do what I can tell you a\nBomb got a lot of new responsibilities on you all at once\nRight yes I mean with the new job things are going well I'm not really in a bind at all I'm making more money because of the new job I mean I'm not saying you know rich by any means but so I was just on the one that is what I Do\nWell if you're if you if this is your starting point of saving for retirement you want to do as as much as you possibly can stomach financially so in the four one K. did they offer a match where you've gone to work\nOr they start off at six percent and then they build from there I think it I Can't remember right now with the top out is but I Know they start off at six percent of whatever you say\nAll right so you want to put in as much money as you can to pick up all the free money they're going to give you write and do you know are you offered the option of doing what's known as a raw four one K. or as anybody mentioned that do you are you're only allowed to do traditional four one K.\nThey give me all kinds of options the traditional operator off our a nurse and I think\nActually show a rough four oh one K. where we are yeah yeah yeah so I Am thirty six I Would go a raw four one K.\nThe money they employers matching will be a put down the traditional side that money you contribute goes on the wrong side and if they keep raising what they'll match based on how much you put in\nI Want you to go as far in as you can putting money into that raw four one K. C. pick up every single dollar the employer will throw at you and if over time they'll throw more money at you you increase what you contribute\nAnd end the plan there will be if I'm gathering investing is new for you is that right\nYeah I had just basically started with a ... program before I transferred into my new job so I've only ... you know only dabbled with a just a little bit or I you know the my employer now they seem like they're offered a three year deal if I Want to\nSee you around and around every bit of it that they're giving you free money and then as far as an investment choice at least it first keep it as simple as possible and one of the choices you'll likely have is what's known as a target retirement fund\nAnd based on your age of thirty six you would want to look at uh twenty fifty five and then that would be the year there would be your target for retired ...\nOkay and so you just put all the money you're going to contribute ended at twenty fifty and they'll handle how it's invested for you in a variety of things that would be appropriate for you being at this stage of saving for retirement so congratulations to you again on Nora\nAnd best you in this new job and stashing that cash\nFor your long term future [noise] you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nIncluding some proprietary stuff of various issuers\nThey're able now to tell you yes or no and then you know if you get a yes hey I can go ahead and apply for that card\nI signed into my credit karma dashboard to see how it works how it works and so it shows me who I'm good to go to and apply for credit for and it's it's a little jumbled it's not as clear as it should be\nSo you if you haven't spent a lot of time on your credit karma dashboard it will require some time on your part to really understand how the process works and I'm sure over time they'll make that clear but it is a great way to basically test drive\nWhat your credit qualifies for without having to go and do the full application and then only then find out who\nThey don't really liked me\nNeal is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Neal\nHow are you doing\nGreat thank you Neal you were planning on moving but not right away tell me about that\nFor it so I purchase a house a few years ago late twenties Fifteen looking to move in about two years from this coming January and see what a month us options might be ... selling or renting out or what I can do\nWhat you are as serious advance planner here asking me about an event likely to happen in your life two years from now how do you know that that's the window when you're going to move for you in the military or something\nI was in the military and I'm currently a police officer so telling are looking to move on Texas up to Tennessee\nOkay so that you say you have a clear path and and I want to tell you I appreciate your double service\nTo our country I mean you are a picture of life in danger for us as a soldier now you're putting your life in danger as a police officer and I'm grateful to you for that thank you um so\nYou bought a house at a time you got a exceptionally low interest rate on the house I'm assuming\nCorrect there was a three point five percent\nAlright and rates have moved up roughly two point since then\n... and so are you planning to move in two years I don't have a specific a strategy for you that you should sell now rent a home for a while\nThen look for a home when you get to Tennessee because who knows what's going to happen with economic conditions\nAnd prices a couple of years now the house market has slowed down\nAnd people are not able to sell houses in most markets with the ease they were before so what would you do today different than just no you're planning to move in a couple of years and you're going to have the benefit of that low\nInterest rate for at least the next couple of years\nBut now I'm pretty much I'm looking to utilize the VA building on once we get up the policy and similar there after\nSome of the biggest issue with three ten in the house and renting it out the most companies require two years of rental income or else it counts against me as far as that income ratio right um so that's kind of where I Am if I Want to just take some loss if it might be worth it initially\nJust to get that mortgage the tea I out of there\nAgain that is a fascinating scenario you're painting to me and one that that no one has ever opposed to I mean like you did because you're talking about um your family having to uproot twice\nAnd a couple of years but if you wanted more certainty that is what you can do you could keep this property\nYou move somewhere else has a renter you walk in that ultra low interest rate you have a three and a quarter my only real concern with that scenario\nIs that\nYou then are in a position where you're going to be living in Tennessee with a rental property in Texas and that is very difficult to manage from so many miles away\nI really do you have any experience with dealing with that or the rental property agencies or whatever they might be called a play date\nWith what was that expression use I'm Sorry\nA is a property management\nOh yeah property man I use a property manager to manage a rental property for me that I have that's three hundred miles away that I just could not adequately properly manage it and so it depends on local conditions but in my case I pay half\nOf the first month's rent is commission and then after that I pay a much lower commission re moving forward so I tend to attract long term tenants\nAnd so I've got a big hit up front and then small were after that the disadvantage to me is that anytime something breaks when I'm build for it for repair maintenance something like that seems like it's not the most generous bill ever\nBefore a Senate does tend to be fairly high because I mean they are providing a service to me overseeing the property and managing it so you have a significant rake off in your net revenue for cause of the commission's you're having to pay and the ongoing expenses you pay\nSo I I don't know even with that very attractive mortgage rate\nI don't know that you fit the scenario of somebody who would keep that\nProperty as a rental going forward and so in that case I Would say why don't you keep it simple for you and your family lived there until a it looks like you're ready to move to Tennessee\nAnd then put it on the market at that time you'll have the benefit of maybe a couple more years of your mortgage based on that three in a corner and then at that time you sell it\nAnd you move on there are no perfect crystal balls but that's what I Would do Judy joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Judy\nClarke how you doing I'm I've been a big\nFan of your show for so many years and now we're retired in Daytona Beach\nWell how do you like living at the beach\nOh love it love it I live in paradise oh that's great [laughter]\nAnd Clark my questions about auto insurance or we have a what a major company is calling in non castle policy I mean if it actually what does that mean a no matter how many\nUh wrecks or accidents I have that are my fault\nWell I still the towers but at what at what cost\nYou you just laid out better than I ever could [laughter] you know this is a gimmick with the non cancel auto insurance policies because unless it also includes a cap on how much your premiums can rise over time\nUh-huh then I don't see any great virtue and somebody saying\nNo matter what you can be the worst driver and the world\nWe're still going to insure you but if it doesn't say at what cost that promise means nothing\n[noise] okay you know I've been talking to some other
