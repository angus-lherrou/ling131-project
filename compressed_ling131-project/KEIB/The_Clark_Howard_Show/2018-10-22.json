you make you want to offer advice while that's a free service of our show a veil over forty hours\nEach week your card dot com scroll down a little you'll see the phone number or an hour's that off the air advice is available to you\nSo I Want to talk to you about something that I've been getting a steady number of questions about on the air and ask Clark says well parents trying to figure out\nHow to do allowance to school age kids\nOr how to pay school age kids for chores whatever's required in your family in order to get allowance\nAnd how to do that because how did you used to do that you gave people cash but now more and more\nThe parents of young children don't carry cash themselves I mean why our ATM's disappearing\nAll over the place because caches use so much less than it used to be\nParents using plastic that's all the kids ever see 'em do and the kids plastic is cash so that's led to a bunch of products that it's been a steady stream of product introductions where\nYou have remote double cards you as a parent can monitor on an app on your phone or on our website and you can even with some of these cars you can control where your kids spend money\nNow the downside with these card programs is usually you have to pay fees to be part of these programs so you're paying money to be able to give money to your kids which I've never a fan of\nOne in particular though has been really intriguing to people and that's green light\nWhich allows you to use green light as a way to try to encourage your kid to save you know I'm so into the daddy match or on retirement plans where my kids is teens as they are the two older ones\nOut of this but as they would save money from jobs I'm match a dollar for dollar going into a Ross IRA to encourage saving not spending\nBut we're talking about with green light having one of those cards it costs you sixty bucks a year to have the card sixty\nSo that's a lot of money to pay to then have the ability to encourage you could say within the card plan\nSo this is gonna be weird I Want you to turn\nBack the clock and what I'd like you to do instead\nIs allowing to your kids were that archaic thing called money give 'em money you won't have to pay any fees for it kids get the finite and is with actual money in their hands that they don't get with a plastic card\nAnd if you can afford to do a match\nLike greenlight does when you allowance a kid if they're willing to save money that they then turned over to you periodically for you to put it in a savings account or put an investment account or something like that you tell them the incentive is\nEvery dollar they don't spend you're going to match with the dollar to create that concept\nSo somebody comes up with a free card like usa\nNow my kids grew up with usa spending cards or whatever they call them where you have parental control and all that and it's all free\nI get free I don't get paying for these things but ultimately I can tell you with my kids even a usa spending card was not nearly as effective teaching the finite and has the money as cash", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Los Angeles",
