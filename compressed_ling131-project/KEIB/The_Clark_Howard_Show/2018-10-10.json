you with us here on the Clark Howard show where its value learning ways to keep more of what you may you may or may not have heard the news reports\nThat a number of the nation's largest banks are facing a very heavy\nBarrage of cyber attacks right now attempts to hack into the bank operating systems way beyond just trying to take over and individual account at the bank but in fact to disable their computer systems at the bank\nNow nobody's saying but you can just assume that it's a state actor who would try to completely disabled or computer operation at a bank even according to federal officials maybe even to wipe the data clean\nOn all account holders\nThese warnings coming from his office there isn't the federal government I saw this on Wall Street Journal dispatch about this there's an office of critical infrastructure protection and compliance policy\nThat the Treasury Department that's a mouthful isn't it\nIt's very very freaked out about what's going on right now you know you know certainly assume it's the Russians or another foreign power trying to mess with us Russians always the first suspect because\nOf the evil boot and in charge but anyway in the past things the Russians have been up to I don't understand the Americans who don't\nGet how rotten terrible the Russians are under ... anyway I digress\nSo think of two things one\nIf a bank's database gets completely wiped out it is long term no real problem short term there are potential hassles plus the long term one of the things that has been implemented I don't remember how many years ago this was\nBanks and credit unions work under a buddy system where they all have and nobody really talks about this because it's doomed to the doomsday scenario what kinds of stuff but there is a companion bank\nA competitor that has a database backup that's never more than twenty four hours old from their competitor and in the event that something happens we're foreign actors able to completely disable\nThe computer operations at a bank or credit union\nPeople will still be able to use their accounts with the other financial institution acting is host\nAnd for you and me after a cut over\nIt should be somewhat pretty much business as usual I guess records would be there'd be like a twenty four hour window of a missing data potentially\nSo which again is not normally the end of the world but two things come to mind with us if we were to receive a serious attack\nFrom the Russians Chinese another foreign actor Iran look at our list of potential enemies that would do this\nWould be North Korea and we got a lot of such potential suspects\nWind a lot of people never have any cash anymore cash for a very short window would become valuable\nHaving a small amount of cash available stored in a place in your home small I mean for a lot of people just for walking around money under a hundred dollars let's say\nHaving that available particularly if you're somebody who's never carries any cash at all you should have it when I travel you know I travel a roughly thirty weeks a year\nI carry even though I never use it I have a supply of cash with me not a huge amount but I have some cash that if ever I had a serious problem where I could not access accounts they still have some cash to function with", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Los
