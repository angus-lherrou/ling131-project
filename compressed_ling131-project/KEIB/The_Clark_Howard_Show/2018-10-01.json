you register or purchase how long does it take for you to register purchase\nAbout a minute all you have to do is you have to um you know in a mere item you know by UPC code name they have a database it'll finally item and then you upload the receipt as an image file a J peg or something\nAnd they don't do this for perishable food and medicine personal care products that has to be you know something durable and uh you know I bought a Christmas present for my daughter and I saw it on sale somewhere else for Fifteen dollars later and I was sort of you know\nCrime the sad cry but then I

Clark Howard show hello bill carpet to talk to you\nWell good to have you here you've got a question for me about your your wheels what do you drive\nLow right now I'm driving a an older ... and it does not get the gas mileage that I Need out of it so I've been looking at a moving into a hybrid\nAs you've seen over the years gas prices go up down up down up down when it does if you do buy a hybrid when nobody wants them when they're ... loved is you get a great deal buying it and then you spend like nothing to run it\nYeah and I'm definitely looking at [noise]\nYou know moving into a hybrid for the gas savings but I'm also looking at some of the older Hi Rich that maybe are coming off as we got some more miles on them but one thing that I'm a little bit worried about is that replacement costs for the battery\nAnd I know you said and asked that the war in like a third party warranty extension on a car is not a good deal but there's that battery changed the equation does an extended warranted hybrid makes sense\nNo because the battery pack for a hybrid used to be a real big expense\nAnd now they're not you know the battery packs on a hybrid if they went out at one time I think it was as much as ten thousand dollars to replace the battery pack and now it is really not a major expense any more typical hybrid battery pack replacement\nWill be somewhere I think about twelve hundred Fifteen hundred dollars you know you're going to have a transmission go out\nIn the car and spend a lot more than that oh definitely\nThe other thing is if you buy a hybrid but it's a model that's been out for a long time they've got the reliability down pretty well on the batteries I made a mistake I did something you're never supposed to do in two thousand three I bought a first year ...\nSome of the Honda Civic hybrid and they just didn't have it right yet on the battery and the battery ended up failing white prematurely\nAnd so we you know they say first year of any car you never want to buy first year like if you were looking at a used hybrid you'd never want to buy one that the original purchaser bought it the first year they made that model\nMember don't do it don't
