Ah yes yes it was and so I thought you know I'm just going to reach out the clock\nAnd get a feel for what he thinks I'm about the concepts in principles behind it\nWell I've called and it's not just a term that originated with me or before the concept of the FIRE movement came along I called it max savers and that and again that term didn't originate with me the idea that if you can live on half of what you make\nAnd coming right out of school if you weren't aware of on every other check\nIt changes the entire trajectory of your life\nAnd generally by your early forties\nIf you live on half of what you make you will have saved enough money and lived a lifestyle that will make it possible for you at that point to be\nCompletely independent financially and if you don't want to work again you're likely won't have to but really it's more about you being totally in charge of the choices you make in your life you know somebody who works hard enough and sacrifices hard enough\nTo be able to um live on half of what they make\nIsn't doing it so that they never have to work again is usually so that they have the choice to do what they want to do the rest of their lives\nTo ban have you been living on a fraction of what you make since you started listening or since you got out of school or what's your track record of Ben says\nYeah I'd say since I've been out of school probably early on about a forty percent savings rate and right now probably more up to like\nSixty Seventy while oh wow I Would put myself definitely in the Mac savers category and and like you said it's for me it's not so much of\nHey I Wanna never work again in my life I mean I Want the option to do that but really I see it more of the road to freedom and equality to do whatever you choose\nExactly which I like to get them and ah you know the people who and I don't want to get into a tit for tat with Suzie Ormond but the ... she's not the only one who really has has been um\nNot supportive of what's now coin just the FIRE movement which is financial independence retire early as ... it's a cute phrase you know a cute\nIdea a but it's a real idea with real stuff behind it whatever you call it whether you call it max saver whether you call it fire or whether you just talk about the financial independence side of fire\nWith the idea is that instead of feeling a prisoner\nTo your bills and wherever you work you are in charge and you make the choices you choose to make and so are you by saving now sixty Seventy percent of what you may\nYou are in a position to be able to make the choices you're going to make in your life and his you pile up more and more money it gives you increasing amounts of freedom to make the decisions you want to make\nSo I'm totally supportive of you are you doing anything though that others would look at it and say man bans having no fun in life because he won't even fill in the blank\n[laughter] uh you know honestly I feel like I live a great life as it is over the years was\nWith my life as in Hawaii probably four or five times [laughter] I'm not married nine years so um we travel quite a bit and I definitely don't think we deprive ourselves although we definitely could spend more money we could you know by the fancier house or cars but choose not to do that\nExactly and you know you mentioned the two areas\nThat end up eating up people's budgets more than any other than that housing and cars\nThat those two things are what become a brutal expenses and they're used to be a philosophy and the U.S that you wanted to reach on a house and by the biggest fanciest house you could qualify for\nI think now there's more of an understanding that that's not where it's at because that monthly payment the overhead of it the property taxes become an albatross instead of a benefit overtime so keep doing what you're doing real\nGood job and I ask you can I ask you a related question of course\nOkay so I'm part of this idea is to be able to reduce your monthly expenses and right now I have a Fifteen year on line I wholeheartedly ...\nAnd I already you know max out my four oh one K. and my wife's IRA my IRA things of that nature so we we don't have more to go there\nAnd I know you you typically discourage people from ever paying down their work at it but um at some point for me to to really at this level where\nI don't have to work anymore I'm it would be awesome to have a mortgage young so that will point in your philosophy what'd you say yeah\nPaying down extra on your mortgage would get rid of that obligation use an okay thing to do\nNow you're talking to somebody who's mortgage debt free and despises mortgages and I carry that at all and you know if you looked at it strictly from\nPriorities there would be people particularly and financial planning would say no you should actually put more money and investment accounts but let's talk about the practicality of having a roof over your head that you don't have a monthly mortgage for the value of that particularly as you hit that\nThreshold where you've saved enough money that you would not have to work again unless you wanted to\nIf you want to now that you've maxed out every form of savings that the tax codes favorable to if you want to just concentrate on zeroing out that mortgage go ahead\nAll right sounds great\nAnd be completely one hundred percent debt free which makes everything you've put before now\nEven easier to make work for you so uh I Know there are those listening to you and me Ben that are like these two men are crazy\nI mean I I'm having trouble just pay my bills every month and they're talking about saving fifty sixty Seventy percent of their pay\nAnd it's got to be something you do from the ground up in the decisions you make over time and there are people who make so little money that this is not a realistic conversation but if you're making a moderate salary to above you can in many cases\nPeople that remain poor and never get out and they asked them what they're planning window is you know this sounds like thank God it's friday part\nOh God it's Monday they have a planning window of a knack for horizon in their life\nThat Dave Ramsey show days it three fond of patriot am eleven fifty for each\nNumbers have been all over the place the latest release from Facebook reduce ... this is the reduced number of people whose information has been compromised in different ways on Facebook is now down to thirty million\nThat's progress because last estimate was fifty million\nFor that tells you how difficult\nThe forensic research is following a data breach\nAs companies scramble and a data researchers security experts try to drill down into who's affected and how they're affected\nThe other part of this is not the good news the good news was the fifty to thirty the really bad news is what the crux God is much more\nThorough than estimated before it's considered to be the worst breach ever\nOf the Facebook social media platform\nAnd the crux have a lot of stuff like they might have your contact information like your phone numbers\nAs they have for a many millions of people somewhere Fifteen twenty million they have information on your email address potentially what computers phones whatever you're reaching Facebook from a your gender\nWhat religion you are at which people can figure out a number of different ways um they know what things you've been searching on on Facebook last physical location so you've been out\nDetailed profile information they did not get\nYour password at least this time there is no information that they have your password or credit card information but one area where I Do urge real caution with Facebook is that you do in fact change\nWith Facebook where you no longer use Facebook as a way to sign in two other accounts you know how often you'll sign up with somebody and one of the options sell off for you is to use Facebook as your sign in putting too many eggs in one basket there and I don't want you to doing that anymore\nAnd when you do get involved with social media\nKnow that the information they are creates vulnerabilities that go much deeper\nThan you might imagine including potentially rating your money if you have it and whatever brokerage account investment accounts or bank accounts you have to\nBe

start picture is made the rounds on um social media on the Internet or one of the houses in the panhandle\nOf Florida that got hit so badly by the hurricane recently that\nThere were there were there was like nothing left at all at this beach community and Mexico Beach Florida in one house was sitting there almost completely intact\nAnd it's so start well I Want to tell you that\nWe have the ability\nTo build tougher homes and the shocking thing isn't beach areas the real cost is not in the structure put on a property is the land that the property sets on that the structure sits on and\nThe cost of construction\nDoesn't have to be a huge amount higher I'm going to go way back in history to Nineteen Ninety two I guess it was\nWhen South Florida got hit very hard by Hurricane Andrew I'm testing my memory from way back but what I Want to talk about is something that shows how important are thought process about how we build as\nTo how a house survived the storm of various types whether it's a tornado hurricane a earthquake standards there are so many different situations where how you choose to build\nMakes all the difference in doesn't necessarily have to cost a lot more because in Andrew\nThere was an area where the entire neighborhood was flat and just like the pictures\nThat you may have seen from Mexico beach and there were some homes there were sitting there looking absolutely fine and those homes happened to be habitat homes\nThat were bill we volunteer labor built way beyond what was the building code at the time and employed technologies that costs virtually nothing like a little thing it's not even a technology so little thing called the hurricane clip\nThat a lot of habitat affiliates around the country in areas subject to tornadoes are filled with hurricane clips which helps support and reinforce the structure of a home and add to the cost of a home somewhere around a hundred and twenty dollars\nAnd make a home much more robust\nAnd\nThe case in Florida we we live part time and a beach community in Florida and our next door neighbor as well as about oh about a dozen homes in our area are built using a new construction method\nWhere the homes are built like and I think this is the one in Mexico beach was the same kind of idea built with concrete and know sheet rock at it\nAnd the homes are built to withstand a cat five hurricane plus\nAnd the windows may not survive they made blowout the home itself is a hundred percent structurally sound\nAnd all that has to be done is its host out there is no issue with mold and so the reason I bring this up is we in America face an increasing problem with flooding", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "19"}
