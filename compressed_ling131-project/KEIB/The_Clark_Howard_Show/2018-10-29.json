line but he is autistic ...\nAnd ... ... and goings fall into the future I pay tied with anything like it hot and then there's nothing guy he could fall back on my ... it had to have paid off\nAnd said the only way thinking about as possibly at least in the house and have you can live off that in and said that like ... when my question is why it\nWow how interesting so if your parents were to pass away and they own a home free and clear and you're trying to come up with how are you going to have enough money to support your young brother\nYou are a real sweetheart to be more of trying to come up with the solutions for this good for you\nThink so the idea of at time of your parents passing to turn the home and do a rental property that I guess you would manage for the money buying a benefit to your brother\nI think that that may be unduly complicating the situation\nWhere what I Would think would make more sense is to sell the home at the time that your parents might pass away and besides we don't know unless your parents or an extreme failing health they could be with us for decades to come right\nRight so so that possibility of the home being a potential answer for your brother it's just too hard to say that right now\nSo I like the idea of better of your parents instructing and there will that if you are to be the executive tricks that the home be sold and the proceeds be put into a trust that you manage for the benefit of your brother\nWell okay and that way you you have no idea what's going to be going on in your life all the years later hopefully your parents are going to live a long long time and who knows what circumstances will be at the time they would no longer occupy the house no longer be on this earth\nAnd so there\nThere's more flexibility if you didn't have money that you then have available to see that the care of your brother\nOkay yeah we we get think about that and now that the the L it probably a further on down there and I guess I can actually starting now I have that as an option that we can get into she chaired by you know\nWhat your parents can do some things right now potentially for the advantage of your brother they can set up what's known as a um five twenty nine ABLE account\nA buddy Holly this is an account for children or dependence that have special needs of some kind of grown and so it's an account that your parents can contribute fourteen thousand dollars maximum to each year\nAnd the money can then turn around and grow tax free for your brother's benefit and then when the money is spent on his needs and care than the money is spent what's in it and all its earnings tax free\nOh these are new accounts and if your parents have looked at this stuff before they may not even be aware that this is a new opportunity for people to put money aside for a child who has a you know can be various types of special needs\nNo charm okay yeah we didn't know that that that would that would make great\nDo you think you're a parent and afford to put aside that kind of money for your brother each year\nNow and now I don't think they can focus on\nFriday so let's talk about one other possibility either your mother your father or either both of them in good health\nYes fair next on a house\nSo another way that people funding needs for a child that they're worried about ah when they're gone is to buy of life insurance policy where the proceeds have better paid into a trust for the benefit of your brother okay\nAnd that is a relatively low cost way to take care of your brother's needs in the future\nAnd to keep it simple your parents would ah in the insurance policy that they would each by they would name you is the trustee\nAnd you would administer the trust because then it's a whole lot cheaper than if you hire a third party like a bank to handle this road for your brother\n... tax act that sounds like a planned Keystone line\nAnd if your parents are part of any association for autistic children if they are in any support group there'll be people in their who've done this stuff that we're talking about and we'll be able to be of some help to them likely\nOkay fine yeah they have to go ... miles on it than that\nProbably you got a lot going on in your own life but I'm so proud [laughter] I Know that yeah you own your own home at twenty four yes\nIt's great that is

and I tell you particularly last decade when we had the banking scandals and the great recession immediately following when I Would give speeches I Would ask\nWho thinks their kids are going to have a better life and they had who thinks they're going to have a worse like well those were very pessimistic days but overwhelmingly people would say that their kids were going to have a worse life economically and they had\nAnd that is not how it's worked out overall in America\nKids continue generally better economic success than their parents have half\nBut there's a clear divide and it was also clear geographically generally in the southeast\nKids are not doing as well as their parents\nIn the mid west kids are doing much better economically than their parents which is interesting if you think about the years that the Midwest was referred to as the rust belt and all that and the lack of jobs and everything\nBut what was clear looking around the country and I just gave two examples there the dividing line was absolutely education\nThat in areas of the country where there's a big emphasis on education kids do significantly better than their parents had done economically\nIn areas the U.S and the southeast more than most anywhere else\nEducation is not valued as much and going to college not nearly as valued and college participation rates in a number of southern states or some of the lowest in the United states\nKids do not have the economic mobility or economic success of their parents\nColleges not for everybody is not even necessarily about college but it's about going on to technical school state supported technical school trade school where you weren't skills that are in demand in the marketplace\nBut in an economy that now demands more and more knowledge and skill\nKids not getting the education\nIs what creates what's known by a condom is\nBy the awkward and terrible phrase downward mobility I don't want that phrase they have to be used I Want your kids have upward mobility that is what you want them to have and so I encourage you to encourage your kids wherever you live in the country\nTo understand the importance of education and training\nTo get into a career and education and training threw out there working lifetime so they have more economic mobility and more economic success\nDiane is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Diana how are
