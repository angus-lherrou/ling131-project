it in most states now that it's free there is a much greater likelihood that people will freeze their credit\nWhich is a good thing for you to do\nBack he's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Becky how you doing\nVery well how are you a cleric\nGreat thank you Becky how can I be of service to you\nWell I Am in the process of purchasing a new home it's a little bit more expensive than the initial on that on the end and my family has some concerns as to why on it\nSomething should happen to me not death because that would be covered by life insurance but if I become debilitated little counter injury M. S. can't make my came that's what happens to my home and I was\nTold that there is a mortgage protection insurance available but I talked to my insurance company and they said it that's not typically done anymore\nSo I was wondering what your thoughts are and\nIf that's because I'll keep this clean and I won't use the word they usually use in the industry but it's junk insurance okay\nSo let me tell you this the background in the industry they refer to this stuff is crow can choke\nSo croaking choke crow paying the if you die choke being you're disabled and so they ... talk about it behind our backs because it's an intensely profitable\nInsurance product like the mortgage life there's a there used to be a blended product mortgage life and disability but the thing is is that what's more important than you set it right yourself\nYou said well I don't need mortgage life insurance for cause I have what'd you say you had\nLife insurance exactly it's your insurance that you name a beneficiary for and that been a fishery can then use the money as they wish it would be the most appropriate which may not be paying off a mortgage\nBut the big thing is that the mortgage life insurance that it's pedaled so heavily costs roughly ten times what a individually purchase life insurance policy would cost\nBut the life insurance is only good if I crow\nRight let's say a word choke so which I Hope you have ... you should have more concerns then if if you became disabled and you were unable to work been just what's gonna happen with your mortgage because there are so many bills of life\nThat continue to go on if you're not able to work and that's why having your own disability insurance policy for disability insurance policy through where you work\nIs fantastic to have and it's something almost nobody buys\nBut is a very valuable piece because during someone's working lifetime there three times more likely to become disabled than to die right but people will even though not enough people by life insurance almost nobody buys buys disability so\nI Do have short and long term disability ...\nWork then then you're good okay you're good and uh how how much would you say you're a wife or with where you're working\nA lot I think it's for three hundred\nNo no I mean how [laughter] I guess I didn't have raised that in English so how likely you are you to stay at this place of employment for the rest of your working career\nI'd say it's highly likely that in the field that I and it's also common that people do new federal company to company so\nIf your health is really solid\nI think it'd be worth it you getting a quote owning your own disability policy [noise] okay rather than one through your employer because if you own one through an employer and you switch employers let's say you're not in health\nAt that time to get the disability policy owning your own becomes portable just like having your own life insurance policy\nIs adding a term life insurance beneficial for me as well I mean I'm almost fifty so\nYeah so I Love term life insurance and having that to provide for the remaining cycle of your working lifetime depending on your family circumstances like do you have minor children\nNo I'm Single\nOkay so the purpose of having that insurance is principal you to provide for survivors that depend on you for income if you don't have anyone that depends on you for income there's likely not a big reason for you to have\nMore life insurance but the disability that you would own would be very valuable\nOK okay very good thank you so much already having a great day you too Bye bye bye Eric's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Eric\n... from the great northwest thanks for all you do for us\nAbsolutely so where in the northwest you live\nI'm up in Washington state just outside Seattle and that is rainy\nWell producer Joel was born in Oregon so\nA youthful country\nYeah so he left though is the young kids that he doesn't remember a whole lot except when he goes back to visit that so uh why is football played outside in Washington state with all that rain all the time during football you know\nThat that's a good question they put a roof and that's the uh baseball stadium I don't know why they didn't put one of the sea hawks stadium [laughter] I\nDon't get it I just don't get it but anyway that's neither here nor there [laughter] so Eric how can I serve you\nSo I have a a beautiful sweet girlfriend very very sweet who has in the past and taking advantage of and uh and subsequently has a credit history that's not so salad\nUm she's trying to rebuild it and I want to assist or a and rebuilding it faster I'm a staff that she can and will my question was if if I put her\nOn as an authorized user to my credit cards because Mike night game in history is really really good um\nBut without giving her the card or or let her actually believes that just an Oscar I use it with that um\nReduce her credit score because it's a new pair of ... shot as like a new I\nDon't know that will be nothing but positive for her depending on the issue are and how they report authorized users it will either be nothing or positive\nAnd it won't ... will be to her advantage in you already gave the preamble that you would not be giving her the plastic\nAnd that's very important because relationships change and all that and you don't want the plastic in her possession but having her as an authorized user allows you to really be of value to her the things that she has\nHow old is the trouble on her credit [noise]\nProbably [noise] ten ten years\nNothing that old should be on her credit items only stay on your credit seven years okay\nAnd so when's the last time that that if you've talked about this together when's the last time she looked at her credit report\nUm a credit report I'm not sure I Know she's got credit karma so I Know she's monitoring it and it's trying to rebuild um so I don't know as far as our credit report that's a good a good idea tissue with\nCredit ... on the credit card machines see her reports to and what she should look for is any items that are not what's called age properly because of her problems with credit go back a decade\nThose things should not be present on her report so she should essentially have a no file almost versus a bad file for things from long ago\nIt's not unusual for a collection agency to do what's called refreshed the date\nTo try to keep something active in somebody's mix that shouldn't be\nAnd then what she would do is if something's on there that is too old she challenges that with the credit bureau notify us whoever has it dated wrong\nThat she's challenged it needs to be removed and generally when somebody savvy enough to do
