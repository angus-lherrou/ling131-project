at nine back here tomorrow [noise]\n\n\nVetted right that's right and that's something I've I've felt forever but even more intensely after Enron went by the last decade and people's in total of their IRA was an Enron stock and everybody's retirement got wiped out\n[noise] so they'd gotten me wondering well first I was wondering why and I guess that explains that um but then also my company actually offers a stock purchase plan for employees that is a Fifteen Percent discount when you are just stuck\nYeah law does plan to have to hold it or at least one year before you can show it and I was wondering what would\nBe the best way to go about managing it I'm I'm fairly new to investing overall among the you're doing it for a couple of years I'm I'm thirty three years old and he's just back into the game kind of late um and so my ideal is is the kind of keep it there\nUm and just let it grow a along with my four oh one K. um however when I encourage the other day I thought maybe that might not be the best idea so I was just wondering what your suggestion would be\nSo I Love these plans where the company offers you a discount and I guess they take a little bit out of each paycheck and find the purchase of the stocks that they give you a Fifteen Percent off\n[noise] is that right [noise] yes that's right yeah\nSo I I Love that because they're giving you a direct incentive and you've got a guaranteed Fifteen Percent\nDeal on the stock I mean that's pretty great and then the iffy part is you have to own it for a year\nAnd then add a year you can sell so it's possible the stock would go down over that next here and even though you got to discount you might lose money beyond the likely\nThat you would lose money consistently and it's really a a great gift they're giving you\nGiving you an opportunity to be an owner of the company and part and on the stock so I don't have a problem with that\nUm and you could at the years mark ... salad and take your profits paid the tax on it\nBut after the four oh one K. thing\nThere's when you load up a four O. one K. with company stock that's the money you're depending on for your retirement money that you're doing and the stock purchase plan where you get the discount you can use it for any purpose you want after that twelve month holding period\nOkay and you and I was just could add all out at that twelve month so are there different issues and different concerns\nOkay actually and I guess I was wondering if I should be taking that money and you know selling it taken the property and then you know moving back to something else like an IRA\nWhy we're live at a you took the words right out of my mouth when I Would love him smiling as you asked that because you made it sound like you don't get the investing thing at all and you ask the perfect question so if you how the stock for a year you sold it then I'd love it if you put it in a Roth IRA\nAnd because you're allowed to put up to fifty five hundred dollars a year and a raw you put money in a Ross and it grows tax free all through the next Thirty years you'll be working and then you spend that money and everything at CERN tax free\nSo and then that automatically diversified you away from the company's stock in a four one K. you have what are you putting your money in and hit\nA with a company matches or six percent so I'm flip the six percent match in there\nAnd then what do you ... what do you investing in the end\nOf oh oh well most of it was in um the vanguard I'm target fun\nThat's perfect and I would put it all and the vanguard target fun for since you're thirty three much look like um oh what would that be great doing like twenty six the twenty fifty five\nAre a lot of face twenty shave the child I Want to say yeah\nThat's fine and there'll be a great decision and then you're completely diversified away from what you're doing in that company stock\nAnd then if you did a Roth IRA with money you'd sell after a year of that company stock plan you could put all that and a Roth IRA with vanguard in the same target retirement fund twenty fifty five so you'd have\nYour a four O. one K. at work it would be a ... times and then you have Iraq there would be after tax money and that would be a beautiful combo so sounds to me Brandon like you're doing a great job and you should know that\nIt's saving money for a time or thirty three puts your head and most people don't really think about it till they have their fortieth birthday so you're not behind you're kind of a head of a lotta people\nMarlins with us on the Clark Howard show hello Marlene\nBut after ... lego and\nI'm having a great day and I hope you are to\nCertainly are um [noise] just a question or one question I I'm a state employees retirement fund I've been a contributing to with my employer for about twelve years\nAnd he\nNeeded to retire in order to do all the funds out so I couldn't do that\nUm and take a lump sum would would there be any other\nPlans that you'd recommend take a I think it's maybe about twelve thousand dollars which isn't that great some but should I correlate that with another plan\nSo you said this is a state retirement plan\n... public employees with family plan\nAll right so you got this twelve grand and so your option would be to take it where they give you just a monthly check for the rest of your life forget that twelve grams\nSo until I D.C.'s by receive that amount but if they allow payable too I'm an air war um you can write\nDepends on the state plan and uh uh my thing generally is I'm like for you to get the monthly check\nAnd the reason as you're not as likely to be able to generate as much money from that twelve thousand as the state will pay you every month\nAnd if there's somebody who's really depending on you I'm In the event that they outlive you ... you're married you have a wife who beat depending on you yes so what you can do\nIf you're if you're say plan just terminate set the time of your death and doesn't offer a survivor payment to your wife at that time you could do something pretty simple you could buy a term life insurance policy\nThat at the time of your death would pay a a benefit to your wife and then ... regardless of where the sources of funds would be she would get a that amount of money in order to have to live on\nProbably read this
