student loans [laughter]\nThat has got to feel great [noise]\nAnd the U.S\nHow many years have you been burdened by student loan debt\nNine years wow\nIt's going to feel great to be done and there are a lot of people green with envy that you turn your student loan to zero and less than a decade\nBecause some people are facing Thirty years with student loan debt but that's a great thing that you are done did you pay off on a more aggressive schedule or just work out you were able to pay it off and nine\nMore aggressive schedule I I kind of late a plan\nA of getting it paid off in less than ten years because I didn't want this you know over my head like you just said it was a Thirty Years' that's just too much I'm really a stuck with it a little more way more than the minimum payments and uh I got it paid off in nine years\nAnd I don't know if you've heard me say to others in the past to successfully paid off student loans you need to keep your proof that you have successfully paid off your student loans for the rest of your life [noise]\n[noise] right and I need to contact now about that before ... right\nExactly and ... you know has had a lot of spotlight on them for abuses in the student lending industry\nAnd so they especially or one that you want to be a hundred percent certain you have a prove that you have successfully paid off your student loans problem in this area is that\nStudent loan lenders were granted extraordinary power by Congress I think in two thousand five where they don't even have to prove that you owe a debt\nThey're able to ah sees your bank accounts are able to see\nEasier paychecks it's unbelievably abusive what student loan lenders are allowed to do and that's why you've got to make sure you have every bit of documentation you can to fight back if five ten Twenty years from now they come back and say oh no\nYou owe money\nYou need those documents to prove and I would keep a copy a digitally and\nThe paper copy as well because paper can disappear at some point over your lifetime\n[noise] uh no question for you sit on my last name at the my order personal show is just a senior lecturer honestly like I was doing\nElectronically is fine and you should have an electronic record for them showing your balance and that last payment would show that you've taken it to zero\n[noise] correct and then the bank also show that canceled check a final payment\nAnd so everything you have that proves that you that you did all that is what you want to be about [noise] so what's your next chapter in your life now that you have stayed to this you've gotten these student loans wiped out what are you going to do next\nI got to say it's a it's a good feeling but it's like all over the next challenge\nOr the next one is going to be a law which I took out foolishly a floor yeah foolish reasons for it I'm done it like I say what the civil loans they get this thing paid off [noise] um but my question was and when I wrote in\nA ... take a

hundred dollar monthly student loan payments\nTo it [laughter] reward yourself I mean you have you ever work this thing so hard for so long if you want to just I have some fun it's like what I always say if somebody comes into unexpected money\nThat you don't be practical with all of it you do something with it just for fun whatever it is and in this case it's like your graduation gifts from student loans\nThere you go and what are they real quick court for other listeners out there um and I don't know if I can mention the name or whatever but there are certain areas that are out there like surveys and\nThere's another one that you know if you make a promise to it's like I say the name um that they will actually contribute to your\nStudent loan payments and that's one of the things that helped me out you know I I was on it and doing it to ah programs and its shaved off a year's worth of famous maybe a little bit less [noise] um but it helps out it's less money coming out of your pocket so\nYou know if it will do research it you know that's a potential for free money out there to help pay down your student loans\nWhere I'm going to a step out there for ... and take a risk and you go ahead and name who was he wanted to name just spent\n[noise] or was he promised\nOh you promise oh yeah yeah yeah you promise is a very interesting program and you promise actually helps you to fray some of your costs\nZach leave or yeah and so you promise has any of a number of features\nThat help you save money for school use money for different purposes really designed around education

at Facebook dot com slash Clark Howard\nJust tuning in earlier we heard from a gentleman who had finished paying off his student loans getting ready to make his last payment\nAnd student loans have been an enormous burden in this country total across the economy one and a half trillion dollars give you a perspective that's fifty percent higher than the entire outstanding credit card debt and the country for student loans\nThe good news is that\nPeople entering college now are much more wary about taking on student loans they're playing harder to get\nColleges are having a tougher time getting people to say yes and the result\nIs that tuition costs after going up year after year or roughly three times the rate of inflation now aren't going up generally at all\nThe list price may be going up but in order to more students into their classrooms colleges are having to offer deals private colleges have become really aggressive at offering deals and\nThe actual cost of four year degrees\nIs not going anywhere for cause the increases we've had over recent years have all been because the ease of borrowing money and people unfortunately not realizing\nWhat can be lifelong implications and burns from taking on those student loans so the marketplace is now working\nAnd it's working because people are making better decisions and a lot of private colleges if you're going private instead of a a government colleges state college\nA lot of private colleges now are short of students some of that just demographics playing into the equation but they're struggling to fill their enrollment and that means that you don't have to be the number one student in your high school\nClass or number five student in your high school class you may still be able to set off a competitive battle a bidding war if you will\nAmong schools they would like to have you as a student\nRemember my rule though you're never going to protect your wallet if you only negotiate a first year deal you need to negotiate a four year deal\nAbout what that school is going to offer you versus another school versus another school may have heard me tell the story that my daughter\nUh after she made her decision where she wanted to go to school and rejected places one of the school she rejected came back and offered her a monster scholarship if she changed her mind\nAnd go to that place instead of the other one where she's actually attending and I was kind of hoping she'd say monster scholarship I'm going to take it but she didn't but it was out there and that's the thing is to use the marketplace to your advantage and was state school systems\nThis very somewhat state to state but more and more states are now going to\nThree tier or for tier\nStates supportive school systems where they will have way it is for lack of a better term maybe sometimes used in a state\nThe flagship state universities charge the highest tuition\nThen there'll be second tier third tier Fortier is a community colleges many of which now offer four year degrees each here has a different tuition level the greatest irony of it though the whole system", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Los
