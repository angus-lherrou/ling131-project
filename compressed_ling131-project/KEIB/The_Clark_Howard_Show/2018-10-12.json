Andrew you are moving towards the end up paying off your student loans is that right that is correct well what kind of journey if you've been on with that how ... then\nUm I Would I Would say it's been pretty rough of tried to focus pretty heavily on trying to get those paid off as soon as possible um but it has taken a lot of um a lot of work to do so and I had to make sacrifices but we're nearing the end so I'm pretty excited about it\nWell that is great news how much do you have less burdening you\nGuys just over sixty one hundred at the moment\nOh that's fantastic\nBecause you know when I hear from people calling me about student loans usually it will be in the tens of thousands or or probably one in five times there will be more than a hundred thousand dollars in student loans that someone is asking me about\nYeah I started at the right at about thirty two I'm a couple of years ago and so of I'm nearing the end so it's a very great feeling that\nWonderful well how can I be of service in this quest to be done with the student loan lenders\nSo the question I have is so I've got just over the sixty one hundred ... in student loans and it's a right at four percent four point zero one percent interest on that [noise]\nI have a a little bit over seven thousand built up and just individual savings and so I'm I'm just I'm questioning do I just go ahead and erased the student loan and be done with it\nOr just continue it out and I'm looking at potentially making your last payment and march or April next year\nSo that's a even if you did not um kill off your savings you'd still be done in another half year\nYes that's correct [noise]\nAll right so that means you're a very determined savor your very careful with your money I Would go ahead and blow out the student loans and extend in early Christmas gift to yourself you know [laughter]\nOkay because you're on that kind of trend line where you're paying five hundred or so a month towards this balance you're going to replenish her savings pretty quickly\nAnd getting to that goal line of getting rid of the student loans is so worth it with the slog you've been through reward yourself and wipe it out\nOkay yeah I appreciate that 'cause that was the kind of the same thing same thought process I had as if I go at a remove this now that just benefits me in the long term 'cause I could put all that extra money back into savings and the Cornish that then throw it back up\nAnd pretty quickly to one thing though that I Want to make sure you're aware that record keeping by the student loan servicers is pitiful and you need to keep the documents showing that you have successfully paid off your student loans for guess how long\n[noise] forever that is right\nFor the rest of your life you need to keep the proof because over the years it's been so disturbing to me when I hear from someone who's being hassled by a student loan collector on loans like long since paid off even decades before\nAnd they have no way of proving they actually pay them off and Congress and its wisdom gave student loan collectors extreme powers where they don't even have to prove the validity of a debt and that's why having your proof of pay off is so key\n[noise] yeah I I I appreciate you reminded me on that I'll definitely make sure I I get that um when I Do get this a clear it out\nAnd congratulations to you and your early Christmas gift to yourself\nThank you very much I I appreciative I\nCertainly and Sam is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Sam\nYes Hi how are you wonderful Sam how can I be of

that I'm hearing from people about the stock market is the last few weeks have been a tough roller coaster ride it's always tough ride when the scary ride is down\nBut this is there's no way of predicting if this is the start of\nA bear market bear market is when the value of stocks overall drops twenty percent or more or even something was known as mild thing called a correction which is the climate ten percent or more but we've had\nA nearly unprecedented run that started in late winter\nOf two thousand and no early spring two thousand nine and it's gone on pretty much with just a few hiccups over\nAlmost ten years nine and a half years this is extremely unusual and values of a lot of stocks by historical measurements are too high nothing like a\nFoolish bubble territory anything like that but stocks do over shoot on the upside and over shoot as they come down\nIt's just part of the emotional factor involved with stocks plus a lot of trading now is computer based and so the moves in stocks can be a lot sharper in short periods of time\nJust in the training session today stocks moved up and down up and down up and down and ah if you look day by day who knows just know that do\nNot panic about what you might hear reported or whatever the stock market was given artificial care for years\nAfter the banking scandals\nAnd the federal government did everything it could to reflect the economy so a certain amount of the value in stocks is fake value because if you think about it if you tried to open a savings account for years and years you would earn nothing on your savings\nThis was all part of the process\nOf trying to keep\nCapitalism functioning in the U.S\nAnd so now is interest rates\nSteadily climbed towards real levels stocks don't look quite as good and that's part of the fact of getting back to a more normal\nEconomic environment and so as a stock investor I'm changing nothing because I Know this is part of the game as it goes through cycles if there was money that I had an stocks that I knew I was going to need to use\nAnd the next few years I Would be nervous because that money shouldn't be in stocks\nBut everything in life is about knowing the risk based on the time that you can afford to take risk\nSo money that you are putting in let's say is most people do most people's involvement with the stock market is through a four one K. or Roth IRA\nAnd through a plan where you're invested in finance\nAnd if you're putting in each pay period or putting in regularly each month let's say in a Roth IRA\nDon't even Fred about any of this just remember that what happens today is pretty much irrelevant if you're ten or more years away from when you're going to need any of the money\nAnd you just keep going studies you go as long as the money you're putting aside in a retirement plan is well diversified well diversified what that means in simple English\nIs that having money in a variety of stocks not your employer zone fact ...
