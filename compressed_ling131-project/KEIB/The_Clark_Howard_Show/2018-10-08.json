after that smear job\nUh I Know it's happening to UBA rape case I guess that's that's following through\nEvery one of these cases though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence and they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get sued and lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes\nI guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly that neither can judge Kavanaugh I Believe for the same reason he's the public figure uh so I don't believe it's going to be able to legally go\nDown that road but this is what they do this is who they are in San I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job pointing out the hypocrisy here\nUh I mean if we're if we're going to have a serious conversation about drinking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you have incumbent democratic members of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss\nUh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they are going to regret long term because every\nDemocrat I I don't I don't think so because it's sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney out and pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system they've given\nEvery

right well I mean yeah I mean high camp and and Manchin but I think I don't think they go that way a less\nCollins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and and flake or or Murkowski inflate once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their constituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana\nMissouri because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean\nJeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters again\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes yeah\nYeah and I I mean [laughter] I don't\nHave real does wrong principle is man that stands on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater is the conscience of the conservative ... and ... you know if he is then now we have a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff Jeff delusion that\nYou are delusional you will never be the president

northeast\nNew Hampshire's not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI mean so out of touch and nobody's interested in the guy that says about I'm only voting this way 'cause I don't have to face the voters again also every other vote was because you wanted to get reelected and you didn't care about what principles were involved in a particular vote\nRight quick break we'll come back

Harry in New York Saturday all Eighteen people in the ... and the two pedestrians died\nYes I Do walk I Need to get some help I really do and that's why I was asking does it make sense to continue paying Fifteen hundred and eighty one dollars a year and home insurance what I really feel I don't really need\nOkay so they're different issues so when your house is\nPaid off take your homeowner's insurance deductible as high as you can whatever your insurer well a while\nAnd that will have the potential cutting your premiums by a meaningful amount and keep your home insured because the purpose of having especially when you own your home free and clear is if you had a real catastrophic loss you know it burns to the ground or something\nYou want to know that insurance is there to rebuild it passed that the doctor will you don't want to take on the full risk of that after you've worked so hard to pay at all\nI knew you're going to say that clock right I was talking about let's talk about what you've got to do now at fifty five you're going to be mortgage debt free how much was your monthly mortgage payment one thousand or fifty\nAnd how much of that one thousand fifty was taxes and insurance\nThree hundred thirty seven sound correct three thirty seven for taxes and insurance yeah yeah okay that's probably the\nReason I'm asking that is that means you're gonna have seven hundred dollars a month\nThat you can start putting towards retirement\nAs soon as you are in a position\nTo be employed again at your new job\nYou start throwing money in retirement you're fifty five so you're allowed to do sixty five hundred dollars each year into a Roth IRA correct and you want to do that so the first sixty five hundred of that you would throw into a rock and then are you single or married\nAre we getting married and by the end of this year\nWell congratulations so they are your soon to be spouse can do a raw as well and even if she is not working she can do what's known as a spouse or raw and put money into it\nOkay is that sixty five out at all so\nYes it is if she's over feels that she is correct yeah so you can start building up meaning savings right away and have you seen I've got a simple\nStep by step guide to setting up a raw\nHey if I add up to that site I almost did it but I um I got involved with something else I I have a non profit that they do I want a lot of money at the clock I got to stop it okay my passion is taken away my finances\nGot you got to build up or you'll be working in forever right and you've done a great thing paying off that mortgage now it's time to build up your nest egg for your future so you don't have to work forever ... de Katie's with us on the Clark Howard\nShow Hi Katie hey there how are you doing good thank you for having me\nSure you are trying to figure out if a Ross IRA is a good path for you or a type of insurance\nActually I I eat out with someone that was a financial advisor or not not financial advisor she had mental and I you know we are talking about stuff like that and she just go to a crime that I've never heard of that ... that was worth getting\nNicer we're talking about an index universal life policy is that what you mean I ... yes okay so I Am not an unbiased person to ask okay I Need to lay that out for you I hate universal life policies of all flavors\nI hate that so it's going to be hard for me to give you a balance dancer here so why did I tell you why I hate them and why I Love Ross and just take it as one piece of information that you can use to make a decision okay\nOkay so we're the Roth IRA let me first say why a lot of it and we'll compare back and forth so with a Roth\nWith money that it earns is tax free ...\nIt's not some kind of odd ball way to maybe get a tax advantages tax free Ross IRAs if you go with a low cost company will have an all an expense often about or less than one tenth of one percent per year for the money you have in a raw\nOkay the universal life products will tend to have an annual expense of one and a half to two and a half percent so\nThey will be many many times more expensive and over the years the difference between\nThose expense ratios is the difference between you going to work for years more war being retire because you end up with a incredibly larger amount of money\nIn a low cost investment versus a moderate or in the case of a universal life policy it's considered to be a a high to ultra high cost investment\nNow as far as the universal light products like an index when they're promising is that you earn a percent of the gain of the stock market in years that gains\nBut you don't suffer a loss in the years that it has losses\nRight so do you know that's a complete and total why\nNow\nTotally it's it is\nI mean it's like if I were to tell you the moon is made a Swiss cheese I mean it it really is and it's really yummy nutritious as better tasting than the Swiss cheese on earth I mean that's about as equally true is somebody telling you that that's what an index universal like policy does that\nYou get the upside no downside\nRight okay\nLet me tell you why that's a big fat lie\nRight first you're only given a tiny portion of the actual gained the stock market has an ... year and you don't get what in most years is the most important part of gains in stocks which is the evidence insurance company doesn't give you any of those\nAnd then the downside protection so remember you only get a little portion of the up the downside protection requires that you meet dozens of pages of conditions in the index universal like policy before you\nAre able to have what what would be referred to as the safe harbor of no loss on your money\nBut again I'm worse than that with the universal like policy if they failed or perform as the illustration you're given says you can get hit with what's known as the capital call\nWhere in order to keep the policy from exploding and being hit with a massive tax bill you have to put in more money at a time in your life you may not be able to\nOkay we'll pay the\nOnly people who ever make out from any universal like policy is the agent who sells it and the company that agent works for\nApple\nPie I mean I mean I get upset when I talk about universal life insurance because I Need to tell you Katie I'm has so many people call me over the years who bought one and they get one of those capital call notice is there like what do I do they want another like fourteen\nThousand dollars I mean I have to pay it within thirty days or else I mean it's just rotten arrow oh gosh\nBy so then I'll tell you the last worst part of it ... the illustration that the insurance agent shows you telling me showing you how the money is going to grow and not just this guy is going to grow through the galaxy and you're gonna have wealth beyond your wildest dreams\nWho they're allowed to make up the numbers on there in most states so they can sit down at the computer and put in whatever rosy scenario they want and then it'll say at the bottom in mice type for illustration purposes only\nTime\nOther than that you can tell I loved them right [laughter] ... lays on the other hand are very\nSimple product you can buy them commission free\nAnd I've got a list of companies that sell commission free Ross the money grows tax free spent tax free they're ultra simple to set up ultra simple to have an ultra simple to spend the money from\nOkay\nAnd I think that I explained to me as a long term insurance is that\nYeah the insurance and them as a joke okay because when the capital calls come if you can't pay them you not only lose the policy have a big tax bill but there is no insurance either\nAn inherent to protect your loved ones who buy something that agents not going to tell you about and its level term insurance we're all it does is pay to your survivors in the event you die it costs like nothing\nAgent can't pay the gasoline to come to see you to sell you one of those for the commission they would learn from it so they're never going to talk about it\nGap we're consolidated credits we're here to give you freedom from debt going out for your ... known it was easy I Would call ... years ago\nCall each other in my mind to sixty seven that'd be tempered by my sixty seven fifty eight hundred and five five do you do some\nSort of the

she's not my girlfriend anymore she ran up to ... hours and hours and George is on the garden\nOh we had that call and it is such a risk if you let your guard down and you will wow maybe a family member to have a centrally unlimited charge privilege silly cards cut off\nOr to give to a friend who's your fully responsible\nAccording to credit cards dot com or people who wind a card to someone else\nOne in three got stuck with the bad debt\nOne in three\nTrusted that individual they gave their car too and then got burned for it\nSo no the risk no the consequences and really think through whether or not you should be winning your card to someone else\nAnd know that whoever you decide to do it to your\nBig wide shut down you're the one who stuck with the bill you're listening to the

I Want you to learn ideas to me so you can keep more of what you make it was a study done by a professor at the University of Texas Arlington and was reported on and one of those pointy headed journals about public health\nThey found that when you live in a suburban sprawl county\nThat you are going to ...\nJust under three years less than somebody who lives in a crowded urban core\nI lose somebody doesn't surprise me at all I always thought it was because of the time people spend commuting\nThat that time when you're sitting on your rear end in a car going back and forth being sedentary is what leads to the shorter lifespan but that turned out to be only one\nOf the three factors that lead to a shorter life\nAnd that is a significant thing though is that is your commute is a time suck\nYou have cut out of your life for each time that you might have used to walk or bike or go to the gym or whatever and so again that's one factor another\nIs that if you're doing a lot of suburban driving\nAnd you're more likely to be in an accident 'cause you're driving more miles but your accent is likely to be at higher speed than someone who's in an accident and of course urban area and that's the chance of injury or fatality is significantly higher\nAnd then the third factor blows my mind I remember this one research study\nSo there'll probably be another one later the disagrees with some of the conclusions of the author of this but the third factor is that because of all the driving in a sprawling suburban area\nThere's higher pollution than there isn't a core of a metro area\nI always thought that the corps was where the air was really dirty but it turns out that that's not the case and the dirty air is what can lead to shorter life spans as well so\nThat long commute\nCan be costing your health and costing you three years of your life\nLarry's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Larry how are you doing\nHi Clark thanks for taking my call\nSure you got a credit freeze question for me\nI Do I took your life to help protect from identity theft and for my credit and I'm In the process of thinking about applying for another credit card and before a third of all my credit I wondered if if I just need to fall\nUm just for one credit angels faded or do I need to solve all three\nThis is a frustration of mind because you should only have to thaw one\nAnd generally\nWhen a financial institution is pulling a credit report to decide whether to grant your credit card or not they are pulling from a single bureau because they have to pay for every time they tap into one\n... and I have repeatedly when I've had to sell on my credit for an application for a new credit card or because I'm getting a new cell phone service or whatever\nI have never\nEver been able to get someone at customer service\nTo tell me what bureau they draw from and which one that I Need to thaw and so I've had to thaw all three when I open an account for somewhere where they want to pull your credit or done an application for credit and that's that's silly", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "08"}
