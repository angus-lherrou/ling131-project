here\n[laughter] okay All right well thanks very much for your call hey there\nJohn is with us on the car coward show Hi John\n[noise] clerks crates you are the lady I really appreciate you taking my call\nGreat to have you here you have a question that's been on a lot of inquiring minds about ways to watch TV hit me with it\n[noise] well I'm I'm trying to save my parents a little bit of money on their TV bill ... up or just two hundred dollars with all the bundling stuffed together here oh\nYeah with with a bustling with the whole the whole show on and on the Internet it's it's it's over two hundred bucks so they're kind of on a fixed budget and I'm just trying to see if I can help them out a little bit with that\nUm I was looking at a major carriers a plan of of of limited data\nI'm getting my parents do you watch a lot of TV uh so I'm just wondering if it's something like that would work with them as far as choosing the limited data on that kind of planned for being able to watch a streaming a trainee service\nYeah and uh or either of your parents' past fifty five yes\nSo they're eligible for the fifty five plus plans that both T Mobile and sprint offer that are Seventy dollars a month total with T Mobile I think it's a little higher was sprint\nAnd it started out just talk normally go head to the polls the one that they were looking at yeah\nYeah so with T Mobile bay we're the pioneers even before I'm limited data that allowed unlimited streaming and so yeah the thing with the streaming though\nIs if they're going to project from their phone to their TV ate it uh only streams\nAt standard definition a so they are really into the high def pictures they're not going to have that unless they\nPay for a more premium plan with T Mobile [noise] goes it if I remember right it streams that four eighty pee\nThe reason is the nature of work has changed so much men historically a lot of men have are in the living based on brawn\nNo and doing physical labor of some kind and factory work has automated so heavily why those jobs in the factory that paid well we're really dangerous but a lot of those jobs\nAre now replaced by robotics and machinery or various forms of automation and they're not coming back I mean the United states is the largest at manufacturing it's ever been with a tiny fraction of the labor it used to have\nWomen who so heavily rely on education for the field of work they go into have seen incomes rise\nOver that time period men on the other hand who are not well represented in education generally have seen and comes to climb on average not everybody\nAnd it doesn't mean a college education\nBut getting a trade or skill or that's something that gives you what's referred to as a skilled trade plumber electrician who knows what\nGetting a skill\nIt can be a college degree whatever it is this income gap that men are experiencing you can see what the cause is if you walk on a college campus which I've done so much of\nWith a daughter in college now that colleges are overwhelmingly dominated now on average by women students\nMen are not present anywhere near the numbers of women were in an era that it's all about what you know\nAnd so whatever that is that you would enjoy again it doesn't necessarily mean college it can be a state supported technical college but the point is\nToday education starting out in education for a lifetime is the key to overcoming income declining over two generations you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\n\nThis is John Green and if your teeth are staying from

more of what you may [noise] and you know we have free off theory vice available for you over forty hours\nEach week it's a service of the car coward show for the last twenty six years where you can call for free off the air advice the hours available the phone number to call to talk with a member of team cart\nListed on the home page of Clark dot com just roll down a little you'll see the hours and the number\n... numbers Apple's got the cell phone carriers numbers big time\nBecause apple is the one player in the United states that can move the market you know worldwide apples down to ten percent market share of cell phones being sold but here in the United states rival Sam ... in overall market share\nAnd so\nApple\nFiled a complaint with the Justice Department that I shared with you I think last year\nAbout any competitive moves of Eighteen ... rise and they were blocking the implementation of a much more efficient way for cell phones to operate known as ...\nAnd if you heard as part of the buzz about the new iPhones that they come with each Sam capability everywhere else in the world except the United states people routinely switch cell phone carriers on a whim\nMost places people buy coverage for no more than a month sometimes even for a week at a time in other countries and in many places people will do serve a spy service from more than one cell phone companies simultaneously\nIf somebody is even hard for us to fathom in the United states\nWith our ... cell phone carriers that people tend to stay with year after year after year and therefore we pay generally much higher rates than people do elsewhere in the world where they put competition and to play\nWell the thing that particularly horizon an ATM tier terrified of is the IV Sam which will make you switching a carrier something you can do instantaneously right from your own phone on the go\nOr right from your own home or office whenever you want and then switch back whenever you want is well\nIt creates strikes fear and the hearts of cell phone carriers and that's why in the United states only is this big push that you have this little plastic chip called the sim card put in your phone\nAnd it slows everything down with people feeling for you to switch from one to another\nApple didn't feel like it could launch these phones\nAs ... only but they have any ... capability and also a place for chip\nBut the whole idea is that in the future there will be only these him it's almost like how apple did something that seem crazy at the time when they eliminated the headphone Jack\nAnd people that are apple users now are accustomed to not having a headphone Jack anymore\nAnd So Apple is so influential law and the United states that odds are we will move away from having any of these plastic chips at all no one is sim cards and that would be so great for your wallet\nBut when major introductions a curve like now with the new iPhones and the United states the new Samsung's don't have the same market moving influence but this is the time you should really think about when you're thinking of getting a new handset\nYou think about whether you were with the best cell phone carrier for your service or not\nAn odds are overwhelming that you are way over paying for your cell phone service especially if you are someone who's been with AT and T. or of horizon for a long long
