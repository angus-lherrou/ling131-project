Fifteen looking to move in about two years from this coming January and see what a month us options might be ... selling or renting out or what I can do\nWhat you are a serious advance planner here asking me about and about likely to happen in your life two years from now how do you know that that's the window when you're going to move for you in the military or something\nI was in the military and I'm currently a police officer so and I are looking to move on Texas up to Tennessee\nOkay so that you say you have a clear path and and I want to tell you I appreciate your double service\nTo our country I mean you're already put your life in danger for us as a soldier now you're putting your life in danger as a police officer and I'm grateful to you for that thank you um so\nYou bought a house at a time you got a exceptionally low interest rate on the house I'm assuming\nCorrect there's about three twenty five percent\nAlright and rates and moved up roughly two point since then\n... and so are you planning to move in two years I don't have a specific\nA strategy for you that you should sell now rent a home for a while then look for a home when you get to Tennessee because who knows what's going to happen with economic conditions and prices a couple of years from now the house market has slowed down\nAnd people are not able to sell houses in most markets would the ease they were before so what would you do today different than just no you're planning to move in a couple of years and you're going to have the benefit of that low\nInterest rate for at least the next couple of years\nBut ... pretty much I'm looking to utilize the V. A. L. O. and when we get up the policy and similar that after\nSomebody biggest issue with the ... in the house and renting it out the most companies require two years of rental income or else they count against me as far as that ... Ciau right\nUm so that's kind of where I Am if I Want to just take some laws if it might be worth it initially just to get that mortgage the tea I out of there\nAgain that is a fascinating scenario you're painting to me and one that that no one has ever opposed to I mean like you did because you're talking about um your family having to uproot twice\nAnd a couple of years but if you wanted more certainty that is what you can do you could keep this property\nYou moved somewhere else as a renter you walk in that ultra low interest rate you have at three in a corner my only real concern with that scenario\nIs that you then are in a position where you're going to be living in Tennessee with a rental property in Texas and that is very difficult to manage from so many miles away\nOr you do you have any experience with dealing with butter on TALK of the agencies or whatever they might be called um of evil ...\nWith what was that expression use I'm Sorry\nA is a property management\nYeah property man I use a property manager to him manage a rental property for me that I have that's three hundred miles away that I just could not adequately properly manage it and so it depends on local conditions but in my case I pay half\nOf the first month's rent is commission and then after that I pay a much lower commission re moving forward so I tend to attract long term tenants and so I've got a big hit up front and then small were after that the disadvantage to me is\nIn time something breaks when I'm build for it for repair maintenance something like that seems like it's not the most generous bill ever\nBefore a Senate does tend to be fairly high because I mean they are providing a service to me overseeing the property and managing it so you have a significant rake off in your net revenue for cause of the commission's you're having to pay and the ongoing expenses you pay\nSo I I don't know even with that very attractive mortgage rate\nI don't know that you fit the scenario of somebody who would keep that\nProperty as a rental going forward and so in that case I Would say why don't you keep it simple for you and your family lived there until a it looks like you're ready to move to Tennessee\nAnd then put it on the market at that time you'll have the benefit of maybe a couple more years of your mortgage based on that three in a corner\nAnd then at that time you sell it and you move on there are no perfect crystal balls but that's what I Would do\nJudy joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Judy\nClarke how you doing I'm good I've\nBeen a big fan of your show for so

[noise]\nThere is a shift going on in the vehicle market that I Want to make sure you're attuned to several factors coming together all at once it mean that if you were interested in a vehicle [noise] your timing\nRight now is very favorable [noise] so let me hit you with the factors affecting the marketplace [noise]\nNumber one\nWe've got a situation where we've had record or near record vehicle sales for the last half dozen years\nWe've reached a point where we're way past people who needed new wheels and we've covered a lot of people who wanted new wheels and so now the dealers the manufacturers are running out of the people need and want\nSo we're playing much harder to get\nBecause their replacement market for old worn out vehicles is not that large right now and the number of people who have vehicles that are older not as many because so many people have gotten newer vehicles of light\nAnd then you add in higher interest rates interest rates on car loans has gone up quite a bit as interest rates in the general economy have risen car loans reflect the increases immediately\nSo now people are looking at higher monthly payments\nThe third factor is something I shared with you about six weeks ago and that is that after years of an under supply of SUVs and crossover utility vehicles why things we call SEVs are actually see UV is just you know what the differences\nAre true SUV is built on a truck platform\nVery few in the United states are built on a truck platform almost all of them are built on a car platform just with the body put on top of them that looks like and so it's a little higher like you think of as an SUB\nSo manufacturers were caught flat footed\nSeveral years ago when people shifted from wanting passenger cars to warning these crossovers so there was a continual shortage\nBelow what demand was now a vehicle makers of caught up the auto makers are making plenty of those SUVs and crossovers so now we've got supply and demand imbalance at a time that the market soften dealers all over the country reporting\nA more or fewer and fewer people coming into showrooms fewer and fewer deals closing and\nDepending on where you are in the country a lot are noticing a double digit declines in sales so this is a great opportunity for you\nIf you were actually someone who's in the market for vehicle it means that you're in a position to have far more negotiating power especially if you're interested in their crossover or an SUV you're much more negotiating power then you've had in recent years\nSo yeah you will face potentially higher interest rates but you can dial back the clock if you historically have gotten your vehicle alone at the car dealer\nAnd instead this time you get it at a credit union you will likely drive the interest straight back to below what it would have been at a car dealer before interest rates rose cause the interest rate differences so gigantic\nBetween a credit union and a car dealer and significant between a credit union and the bank\nThe other thing is as you are\nShopping around for a vehicle I Want you to use the online methods to shop for a vehicle if you're a member of one of the big warehouse cubs Costco and Sam's they both have car buying programs no negotiation and the marketplace\nSoftness is directly reflected in the pricing you'll see from those programs superior usa
