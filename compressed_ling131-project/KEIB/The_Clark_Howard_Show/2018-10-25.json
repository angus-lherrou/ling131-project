I'm going to give you some crazy suggestions okay\nOklahoma you're ready for crazy ...\nBecause I'm always nervous about putting money in a kid's name because as precious as our kids are when they're young we don't know exactly how mature they're going to be and responsible once legally they have access to money\nSo now is a Thirteen year old seven year old and one is going to be one soon you are in a position now with the custodial accounts you get to make all decisions\nBut once said she was considered to be adulthood which is actually often before kids mature enough to make good decisions with money\nIf they find out the money's there they have the ability to take control of it and spend it on things that you've worked hard to save you might not be able to control so\nWhy you're ready for my weird suggestion I recommend\nYeah\nYou've heard me talk about Ross IRAs\nAnd found\nIs that something that you and your husband do\nWe go out right now on the lookout he didn't have any\nAny

a decent amount of money to each of your children are sounds like and maybe mid twenties\nLead over a lot right ball um well I feel like they're ready for it\nSo you maintain a hundred percent control

way enough money over these years moving forward\nThat you can fully put money aside they will meet what your goal our goals are for these three kids but see here's the beauty\nYou can only give them what you've contributed to the earnings stay behind with you\nAnd stay there although now till you would need the money in retirement\nSo it becomes like a partial retirement account for you with completely tax free growth you maintain complete control the money\nAnd when you're ready for them to have the money you've contributed on their behalf you can give it to your Thirteen year old ten or so years from now and have it be a completely tax free event\nIf you don't think you're a Thirteen year olds maturing\nAnd I was at that point you want to wait a couple more years you wait a couple more years but you completely are in charge because it's your account your money sort\nOf the loop hole with a raw is the money that is earning a Roth has to be left decide to wage you're fifty nine

traffic on the patriots am eleven fifty and Kathy exams out of the ... and the ad council\n[noise]\n\n\nGlad you're with hair on the Clark Howard show where his about learning ways to keep more of what you make a big push coming out of Washington\nTo require drug manufacturers than these crazy TV ads they do for drugs to disclose in the ads what prescription actually costs\nFor the drugs and the pharmaceutical companies are going crazy like what in the world are you thinking why would we ever want to tell anybody\nThat those beautiful models running through a beautiful setting with the backdrop of magnificent mountains are lakes or oceans or whatever they're smiling year to year well the commentator says\nMay cause your right arm to fall off or may cause you to have really sad suicidal thoughts or whatever\nDavid Lazarus of the Los Angeles times\nHas written recently about the proposal from Washington vet pharmaceutical companies post prices and what's your perspective on this\nAbout having to disclose that those smiling people are taking a drug that would cost you two thousand dollars a month or whatever\nWell first cargo let's get a little credit to the president for at least\nLighting drug prices as something that he's concerned about and indeed since the campaign he has repeatedly return to this and even the drug companies are getting away with murder when it comes to pricing but that said he has offered no\nSignificant maneuver or rule whatsoever to lean in drug pricing and what we got out of the administration last week was simply a proposal that along with all those crazy side effects that get listed what we see ads for prescription Mets on TV\nThe drug company also has to include the list price of the drug in the intent here the administration says is to shame of the companies to bring these prices down because so many of these places are in fact\nIndefensible oh there's a bunch of problems to this first of all what price would they put it in the list price which nobody pays the actual price of the wholesale price\nThat clear but the bigger problem is the drug industry to look at that said we don't think\nSo and then they turned out the first amendment and said you can't compel us to say things we don't want and I put out so called to some constitutional lawyers to say what was that true I mean they've got a list all the side effects cat they also be\nForced to list the price and the lawyer said you know it looks like you can make a case\nFrom the government's point of view to Cold War speech if they were the public interest or public health or safety involved and that's why you do get the requirement for all the side effects but it would be very difficult for the government to argue that there is a public interest in simply shaming these guys with the scarlet letter of having to publicize their\nPrices and so the lawyers are saying you know what the drug industry is going to take this all the way to the Supreme Court where they will probably win in Citizens United environment where the oil\nBusiness has never had more rights and more power and the upshot of this is first of all this is a fight there for the government is the way to win and second of all if the drug industry has forced to litigate guess what they'll just pass those costs on us\nAll right so let's go to the core or something and this is something I've heard from several doctors but this is very frustrating to them with the with the ads for these pharmaceuticals on TV because they all have patients come in\nAnd they're already pre sold doc\nI Want you to write me a script for blah blah blah because I saw it it's going to do all these miraculous things and suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and addition to curing white males me and so their perspective I've gotten from physicians is that we're the problem\nMore than anything else and that we're allowing ourselves to be to influence by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point\nIn the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic Haitian in healthcare terms which means they got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer",
