[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWhen you were in DC we're in the ...\n\nAnd ... with us but I don't understand there's a well I Know there are consequences jumped because I Know Richard ... lawyer at the time of really good guy by the name of Lin wood\nUh he got after a lot of media companies I Know the Duke lacrosse kids oh they went after a lot of people after that smear job\nUh I Know what's happening to UBA rape case I guess that's that's following through\nEvery one of these cases though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence and they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get sued and lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes\nI guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's writer and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh I Believe the same reason he's the public figure uh so I don't believe it's going to be able to legally\nDown that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job pointing out the hypocrisy here\nUh I mean if if we're going to have a serious conversation about breaking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you have incumbent democratic members of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss\nUh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down a road here that they are going to regret long term because every\nDemocrat I I don't I don't think so because it sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney out and pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means but I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system they've given\nPossibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote now the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and wears Jeff snowflake gonna vote\nEtcetera and it comes down to three I mean Mitch McConnell has been a real warrior and pushing for actual churning Grassley knocked on the Internet and takes up a Democrat you're exactly right it then it gets a week ago if we would have had\nLike Harvard or calcium or San I think he here that we might not next heroin and eat and I think that not because I had any faith and Democrat\nBut because they have political calculation didn't mind you have your mansion looking at it gate or\nThirty percent margin that people want to see how often from five thirty percent margin that people have North Dakota once the Kavanaugh confirmed it would be political suicide\nOr hike camp or mansion or don't you're not vote for the nominee don't ever get people to get their humor lapdog but they might get out of their own political south actress\nWho factory right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and mentioned but I think I don't think they go that way a less Collins\nAnd Murkowski or a combination of of Collins an end flake or or Murkowski in like once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri because\nIf they did they would say vote your conscience I mean\nJeff Flake the hero with the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters again I mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah and I I mean [laughter] don't\nGet real does wrong principle is man that stands on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's conscious of the conservative ham and it you know if he is then now we have a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first of all just like Jeff delusion [laughter]\nYou are delusional you will never be the president of the United states not in my lifetime\nAll right out of your thank you both for being with us he couldn't get their teen votes I mean he's like at nine percent of his own state race it off to the northeast New Hampshire's not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI mean so out of touch and its own nobody's interested in the guy that says no I'm only voting this way 'cause I don't have to face the voters again also every other

Cathy\nClark how's it going\nTo get ... how are you doing\nWonderful thank you which is very important that we are both doing well when you want to ask me about long term care insurance right\nExactly so what's your scoop\nWell I'm I Am sixty five my fiance is sixty seven we're both retired and we're getting married and congratulations\nThinking and we had a meeting last its financial planners to get health planning for our financial need during our retirement and to um [noise]\nWell looking at it as in any state planning tax planning and that sort of thing and we want to make sure that you know either one of us and that can have our debts and we don't want to be charged families and so\nOn and what are they for if you're not going to be a burden on your family is\nActually right [laughter] [noise] so in that way you know we didn't take it with\nUm [noise] you know the issue of long term care and insurance and it's it's really expensive um and so we were just wondering if he might have any suggestions or you\nKnow this is this a real problem because generally you have a segment of the population that doesn't need long term care and that's people who have a very large number of assets generally north of three million dollars okay\nAnd then people who don't need a long term care because they got nothing they don't own a home you know they're renters they have a very little money saved they've got no investments so there's this group of people in the middle that don't have millions of dollars and assets\nAnd do have some things like maybe owning a home and other accounts they don't want to be impoverished by long term care and you mentioned not a burden on the family so if you're in that middle section and would you say that you and your fiance are in that middle\nI Would say that we're in that middle\nYou you do have to think through what in the world are you going to do if one of you ended up needing assistance with what's known as life's daily activities needed long term care needed a assisted living for nurses skilled nursing home what do you do and [noise]\nThe market offers am perfect answers instead of the long term care insurance will generally pay for a three to five year period depending on what you buy\nIt will have an inflation adjustment to deal with medical cost inflation over the years the premiums are not guaranteed they can go up\nAnd even initially you're looking at several thousand dollars a year aren't you\nYes so it is one of those\nThings there is no good answer\nA there are strategies people do where they go see an elder law attorney and title assets in a way that the assets are not at risk it's considered to be a um a a strategy that some people don't like the ethics of others are happy with\nOr you are you by the long term care insurance\nOkay um I read online ad out an option regarding in ... in community care\nI'm ... I get the idea that it's basically investing in you know community care facility where\nThe the life stages ones yeah you go in and independent living\nAnd then as your needs change you move from place to place but they they don't provide the care for free I mean you go into a state a facility that deals with the stages of aging you're still gonna have to pay\nFor the care right so it doesn't relieve the the cost burden so if you if the two of you want to make sure that you're not a burden to each other and you're not a burden to your kids and you're both healthy now\nAs much as it hurts to write a several thousand dollar check a year\nI Believe it or not I recommend it\nOkay\nBut I Want you to get a five year benefit if you can afford it and a decent inflation adjustment which are usually be minimum three percent per year\nCovering inflation over the years 'cause a benefit to you today is sixty five\nLet's say you wouldn't need any kind of assistance to your eighty five right if you don't if you don't have inflation adjustment a benefit looks good today will be useless Twenty years now but I Do have one other alternative\nOkay going back to age eighty five you can buy something known as longevity insurance is anybody mentioned is not at all generally nobody mentions it because the commissions on it or not very good okay\nSo you can buy a policy that only pays a benefit if you make it to age eighty five and then at age eighty five it pays a very generous monthly benefit for the rest of your life\nAnd so it's money you can live on in the event you need any kind of long term care is therefore you die before age eighty five ... if it goes up in smoke okay but it's a very affordable way for you to find much later in life\nWhen the odds would be higher but you would need care\nAnd so I'm like the longevity policies as an alternative you'll have to work around on your own you probably want to look for a fee only financial planner\nBecause commission oriented sales people won't want to talk to you about it\nAngel is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Angela how are you good thank you you want to make sure that your kid knows how to handle a huge amount of money some day is that\nRight [laughter] I Do what's the story parents' dream right right\nOur daughter is nine and we had a thirty year old and we just want to figure out a way that we can help her chart shady now so that would get a you know twenty Twenty one that she felt she has enough money to do is she wants\nAnd I teach remember listening to you and watching you\nUm several years ago talk about um lays out the children can start shaving at an early age and he said if certain amount each year and then by the time they were in the early twenties they could come to an air Toby good I'm a refresh my memory is so\nWell actually I'm going to burst your bubble that they can contribute what I talked about is that they have a young kid starting at age Fifteen certain squinting aside two thousand dollars each year they can do that until they're in their early twenties\nAnd never put in another penny and by old age there'll be a millionaire\nOkay okay well I Can't you can't side money for a nine year old a little bit each year and then by early twenties that child's a millionaire that's not going to happen but the idea is that if you start saving young\nThat ultimately it makes later in life much easier\nSo or financial he thought that they should be\nYeah I like I like are you\nIf it's if it's for a nine year old putting money in a regular investment account to go in something really simple like an index fund where your own little pieces of thousands of companies\n[noise]\nWatch the news the\nVideo\nThis audio is for your review and now for ...

just in the United states is a worldwide problem but I most focused on how we're going to address in the United states and that is our food supplies come from everywhere\nThere's something out given eggs example when I'm Talking to a school group something like that\nIs a way to really get their attention I say you know it was really easy when I was a kid not to have to eat vegetables all the time or eat fruit all the time because we only had rude or vegetables when it was in season\nNow and they got really interested in that now because we live in a worldwide food market\nIt seems that things are in season all the time that whatever fruit or vegetable you want is pretty much available twelve months a year but that food chain we now have has come with the addict complexity that people can get sick\nWho source of the illness hard to track\nAnd keeping people safe has become so much more difficult so we'll have these outbreaks of of foodborne illness\nAnd you can have fatalities you can have illnesses that can go on for a significant period of time before the CDC or whoever else suffer sleuth on the case can track down the source and shut it off\nYou'll hear from time to time happened with lettuce or spinach or whatever well\nThe nation's largest grocer Walmart\nIt will have a new system fully implemented in less than a year where with any food item sold in the store there will be full\nFarm to store tracking real time so if there's ever anything identified as a potential source of illness it will be able to be tracked down a whole lot quicker\nAnd the recall will happen a whole lot faster and the danger to people will be greatly reduced we cannot make a food supply a hundred percent safe\nBut what Wal Mart is doing is great and any number of large players\nIn the food industry\nBoth manufacturers 'cause it can also be I mean people get sick from things other than produce you know give me actual um\nCanned food or a processed food that can make people sick as well and so food manufacturers are part of this process also and John who\nIs part of our Clark dot com crew recently was in a store with what were\nA frozen shrimp frozen shrimp and it

[laughter] a\nThat is a definite a cow poop alert there [laughter] hey I'm going to show that I Would hate being this really clean as I Am I yeah I agree so when you get a\nPet is right after you buy a home and start getting the pitchers for the mortgage life insurance it's total trash insurance\nSee again I was listening to your podcast and it was saying too good to be true and you had back to back people and they happened to be positive and I was like well I have to give it as have to give it a go I had to ask Clark\nSo better than I did let me tell you what's much more important than and I kind of cut you off there and I apologize you're getting the pitchers for the mortgage life you mentioned in mortgage disability policy is that right that's correct and those are the two main areas that you've been getting the pitchers\nAbsolutely the thing is with that stuff\nIs that where the anybody's pitch for a mortgage life mortgages ability one of the real guy chose is who you're insuring is the bank\nThe bank is essentially the beneficiary or maybe the name beneficiary of the policies so the bank with the mortgage life\nIt pays off the mortgage\nWith a disability it pays the monthly mortgage payment until and unless you're able to work again and so that is the idea of both of them is that you are in fact insuring the bank but they're ready for the punchline of that\nI Am the premiums\nTypically are as much as ten times what the premiums would be for the right kind of insurance which has insurance that you buy that is for the benefit of your survivors who how many of you are there who is there that makes up your family group\nA total three\nOkay so do you have life insurance yet I Do All right so you're doing the right thing there and do you have disability insurance\nI Do through my do my work\nOkay and how long do you think you're going to stay at that employer hopefully they're not listening to hear the answer\n[laughter] um I I plan to stay for for for some time\nOkay then it's All right to have your disability insurance from your employer theory doing the right things and don't worry so much about the mortgage your survivors in the event of your untimely demise\nWill decide whether it makes sense to pay off the mortgage whether it makes sense to sell the house or whatever but it makes sense to do with the proceeds from the life insurance mortgage life insurance on top of everything else is a straight jacket because\nIt's already decided who benefits the bank\nAnd it makes the decision for your survivors and that's a bad idea\nWell I I I thank you very much for your time I got the sense that it was this case and I just I had asked you thank you very\nMuch sure have a great day you too and ... with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Cody\nStay clerk a I wanted to start off by saying they knew about seven months ago called you and ah you coach ... secured credit card and since then my credit score has raised for like five fifty to

up a raw style\nWith one ear Gulf ... and ah I check it every week and I was looking at it recently and it said I guess I misread something when I set it up it says that it's um federal money market

difference I thought\nThat are like at all because I'm which are my girl friends did you go open an account with\nWhere and guard right so vanguard is kind of like the granddaddy of a target

think you might want to retire how how old are you Cody\nKill twenty eight so twenty eight let's say oh let's go uh we could go either to where he says the when you go to a twenty\nSixty or we could go to twenty fifty five either those would probably make sense\nIs the target year and okay so how much money do you have in the Roth right now\nI've only had it open for six or seven long it's like not about Twenty one dollars\nOh yeah you're fine once you have a thousand you can go in the target retirement fund so just call them up and ah at vanguard and tell them you don't know exactly how to make this change what you want the money to go and the target retirement fund a twenty sixty\nOr going to have you back and they can just get rid of this federal money market right open my own and\nIf you've got the Roth open or if they won't do it for you over the phone they'll walk you through how to do it on line\nOkay and you are you able to get the money in the right place and then going forward you just keep putting the money into the target retirement fund as you continue to contribute to the raw and that's great that you've gotten it open and you're getting it done in your

show where its value and learning ways to keep more of what you may there's been a big shift\nIn how the second tier of the cell phone industry is pricing its product and if you're not familiar with how the second tier words each of the major cell phone carriers all four of them have a junior brand\nBecause there are people who are ultra price says it was kind of like if you go to Costco and they have the name brand wine and right next to it they have the Kirkland Signature which is actually the identical wind but the ... say that you're is always a dollar cheaper than the brand name wine\nBut there are people who want the brand name there are other people want the cheaper price even though it's done a couple product well in the cell phone business the cell phone carriers each have their captive discount brands\nAT and T. has cricket team mobile has metro a sprint as long as they continue to exist has boost and varieties and has won that their extra hush hush about cold visible\nThat they want to be invisible but anyway there's miserable and these second tier brands are geared towards the more price sensitive among us\nAnd Michael from Clark dot com\nIs an expert at what goes on in the cell phone industry the price saying how the plans change and zeroes in on what's best for you\nAnd Michael's here with us and let's start with the changes that happened AT Metro PCS that really set off a new wave of changes\nThroughout the industry with the second tier players\nSure had clerk or so what's happening in metro PCS first is they're getting a brand new name and you're going to see it starting October eight now metro PCS his metro buy T Mobile and with that name change comes to brand new and limited plans and for sixty dollars a month\nYou can now get unlimited plan that has Amazon Prime included and Fifteen gigabytes of mobile hotspot coverage that's really it's a that's really unusual for such a low price point\nAnd you can add additional users to it for thirty dollars a month the\nJets so family for what's that it's a ... a month ago\nBut what's what's good about what they do versus the the parent companies and this is true with several of the second tier is that you still get a real good deal for the second user were often you have to have for to get a deal so\nThe second person's thirty bucks third person thirty bucks force versus thirty bucks\nAnd so it not everybody has for people for a cell\nPhone plan right and this land really doesn't seem it it has all these extra features that the big four but going after we for the big for unlimited plants we're talking sixty dollars to Ninety five dollars a month most of the time that's before taxes and fees\nHere you're getting all the features of some of those higher and plans for sixty dollars a month and taxes and fees are included the one compromise really is that if the network get super congested\nAs a metro customer you might get slow down your your priority is lower than it is the mobile customer\nWhich brings us to the most interesting to me of what's happening with the second tier and that's what ... is doing with visible at\nHow much a month for I'm already dollars a month now and that's ... a little bit of plants are Seventy five to Ninety five dollars a month so visible is only forty dollars a month taxes and fees included again\nOnly for iPhones right now they say they're going to bring availability for androids but only for iPhones ... name has not anywhere to be found\nAround visible they don't want anybody to know that it's not it is that is that it's their network and so it's at forty the one guy show with their forty a month\nIs that the speeds that you'll have when you're on high speed data will not be as fast as they are on parent ...\nThat's
