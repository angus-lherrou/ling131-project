[laughter] a\nThat is a definite a cow poop alert their [laughter] they on Showtime and I think that's really clean as I Am I yeah I agree so when you get a pet\nIs right after you buy a home and start getting the pitchers for the mortgage life insurance it's total trash insurance\nSee again I was listening to your podcast and he was saying too good to be true and you get back to back people and they happened to be positive and I was like well I have to give it as have to give it a go I had to ask Clark\nSo better I allowed I did let me tell you what's much more important than and I kind of cut you off there and I apologize you're getting the pitchers for the mortgage life you mentioned in mortgage disability policy is that right that's correct and those are the two main areas that have been getting the pitchers\nAbsolutely the thing is with that stuff\nIs that where the anybody's pitch for a mortgage my mortgage disability one of the real guy chose is who you're insuring is the bank\nThe bank is essentially the beneficiary or maybe the name beneficiary of the policies so the bank with the mortgage life\nIt pays off the mortgage\nWith a disability it pays the monthly mortgage payment until and unless you're able to work again and so that is the idea of both of them is that you are in fact insuring the bank but they're ready for the punch line of that\nI Am\nThe premiums typically are as much as ten times what the premiums would be for the right kind of insurance which has insurance that you buy that is for the benefit of your survivors\nWho how many of you are there who is there makes up your family group\nA total three\nOkay so do you have life insurance yet I Do All right so you're doing the right thing there and do you have disability insurance\nI Do through my do my work\nOkay and how long do you think you're going to stay at that employer hopefully they're not listening to hear the answer\n[laughter] um I I plan to stay for for for some time\nOkay then it's All right to have your disability insurance from your employer fury doing the right things and don't worry so much about the mortgage here survivors in the event of your untimely demise\nWill decide whether it makes sense to pay off their mortgage whether it makes sense to sell the house or whatever that make sense to do with the proceeds from the life insurance mortgage life insurance on top of everything else is a straight jacket because\nIt's already decided who benefits the bank\nAnd it makes the decision for your survivors and that's a bad idea\nWell I I I thank you very much for your time I got the sense that it was this case and I just I had Afghan thank you very much\nSure have a great day you too\nAnd ... with us on the car coward show Hi Cody\nStay clerk a I wanted to start off by saying about seven months ago called you and uh you coach ... secure credit card and since then my credit score has raised for like five fifty to six Seventy\nBut oh wait a minute and a half a year or so you're up a hundred and twenty\nPoints yes oh that's fantastic\nYeah so it worked out well in or around the same time I did that I opened up a raw style\nWith one ear Gulf ... and ah I check it every week and I was looking at it recently and it said I guess I misread something when I set it up it says that it's um federal money market fund\nOh you don't want to be and that\nThere is no place for me to set up for retirement say like a day so it wants me to like diversify the stocks and bonds by percentages and I I don't know the difference I thought\nThat are like that at all because I'm which are my girl friends did you go open an account with\nMan guard right so vanguard is kind of like the granddaddy of a target retirement fund\nOkay or you can call in if you're confused how to move the money across but you want to go in the vanguard target retirement funds for the year ... kinda fits the window when you think you might want to retire how how old are you Cody\nI'm twenty eight so twenty I Would say oh let's go or we could go either to raise the way to go to a twenty\nSixty or we could go to twenty fifty five either those would probably make sense\nIs the target year and okay so how much money do you have in the Roth right now\nIt open for six or seven long it's loud about twenty or thirty dollars\nOh yeah you're fine once you have a thousand you can go when the target retirement fund\nSo just call them up and ah at vanguard and tell them you don't know exactly how to make this change but you want the money to go and the target retirement fund a twenty sixty or Tony ... and not have you back\nAnd they can just get rid of this federal money market\nRight as a model and if you've got the Roth open or if they won't do it for you over the phone that walk you through how to do it on line\nOkay and you're able to get the money into the right place and then going forward\nYou just keep putting the money into the target retirement fund as you continue to contribute to the raw and that's great that you've gotten it open and you're getting it done in your twenties and by the way that thing with your credit score I Can't thank you enough for telling me\nHow many points you've gone up and less than a year's time that's really important information for me to be\n[noise]\nJust a moment [noise]\nI have always despised ticket master\nBecause you go to buy a ticket to something and there's this out rages fee added to it if you're not aware how that all came about ticket master a very cleverly but very diabolical he\nWent to promoters and Venus around the country and offered them\nPretty much whatever they wanted to become the exclusive seller of tickets\nAnd hit a point of critical mass where when you wanted to buy tickets to most anything in the United states you have to go through the ticket master monopoly and with the added on has no relationship at all so the cost of the infrastructure\nIs all a basically a monopoly passed through and it's why I despise monopoly so much and you think that that would be enough\nFor ticket master to rake off out of your wallet but there's a long form story in Rolling Stone you may have heard about the insiders\n... ticket master have\nSpill the beans that ticket master has a system operating where they manipulate the sale of tickets to get them into the hands of their own scalpers\nSo that they're making money both on the fees up front bend the fees when the tickets resold plus the profits now ticket master denies it we'll see what goes on with that but I Want to tell you the whole system is rotten\nWe're getting rocked and it stinks\nAnd when there's a time that I can go to a box office and buy tickets direct and not pay the fee I Do that but there are times I Will not go to an event because I Will not pay the ticket master rip off the\nThe good news for you and me is that a lot of events don't\nSell out anymore that used to people or so distracted there's so much going on in our lives sports events or even if they are nominally a sellout they're soft sell out there are so many empty seats\nAt sports events now you can buy tickets if you're willing to\nAt the last minute often\nFor much less\nThan you would pay if you just gotta gotta gotta be there in addition if you're willing to ... like I Do and the crummy seats\nYou're going to find that you're going to pay for so many events now less than face that you will get an incredible deal\nBy waiting and not being choosy [noise] you'll save a whole lot of money [noise] you're listening to the

been a big shift\nAnd how the second tier of the cell phone industry is pricing its\nAnd if you're not familiar with how the second tier works H\nOf the major cell phone carriers all four of them have a junior brand\nBecause there are people who are ultra price says it was kind of like if you go to Costco and they have the name brand wind and right next to it they have the Kirkland Signature which is actually the identical wind but the ... signature is always a dollar cheaper than the brand name wine\nBut there are people who want the brand name there are other people want the cheaper price even though it's a dental product well and the cell phone business the cell phone carriers each have their captive discount brands\nA TNT has cricket team mobile has metro a sprint as long as they continue to exist has boost and varieties and has won that their extra hush hush about cold visible\nThat they want to be invisible but anyway there's miserable and these second tier brands are geared towards the more price sensitive among us\nAnd Michael from ... dot com is an expert at what goes on in the cell phone industry the price saying how the plans change and zeroes in on what's best for you\nAnd Michael's here with us and let's start with the changes that happened AT Metro PCS that really set off a new wave of changes\nThroughout the industry with the second tier players\nSure have Clark or it was so what's happening in metro PCS first is they're getting a brand new name and you're going to see it starting October eight now metro PCS his metro buy T Mobile and with that name change comes to brand new unlimited plans\nAnd for sixty dollars a month you can now get unlimited plan that has Amazon Prime included and Fifteen gigabytes of mobile hotspot coverage that's really it's a that's really unusual for such a low price point\nAnd you can add additional users to it for thirty dollars a month\nEach yeah so family for what's that it's a hundred and fifty a month ago\nBut what's what's good about what they do versus the the parent companies and this is true with several of the second tier is that\nYou still get a real good deal for the second user were often you have to have for to get a deal so the second person's thirty bucks third person thirty bucks force versus thirty bucks\nAnd so it not everybody has for people for a cell phone\nPlan right and this land really doesn't seem it it has all these extra features that\nThe big for going after we for the big for unlimited plants we're talking sixty dollars to Ninety five dollars a month most of the time that's before taxes and fees\nHere you're getting all the features of some of those higher and plans for sixty dollars a month and taxes and fees are included the one compromise really is that if the network get super congested\nAs a metro customer you might get slow down your your priority is lower than a T Mobile customer ...\nWhich brings us to the most interesting to me of what's happening with the second tier and that's what ... is doing with visible at how much a month for I'm already\nDollars a month now and that's rising some limited plans are Seventy five ten Ninety five dollars a month so visible is only forty dollars a month of taxes and fees included again\nOnly for iPhones right now they say they're going to bring availability for androids but only for iPhones ... name has not anywhere to be found\nAround visible they don't want anybody to know that it's them not it is that is that it's their network and so it's at forty the one guy show with their forty a month\nIs
