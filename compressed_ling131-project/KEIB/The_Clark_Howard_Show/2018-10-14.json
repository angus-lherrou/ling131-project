also stopped short about cutting off business with the Saudis saying the U.S would punish itself if it stops arms sales\nBut what they did in their case is why John wanted me to share the story he said it was brutally tough but they chose not to file bankruptcy\nHe said he'd heard me talk about going to the national foundation for credit counseling\nAnd they contacted them and they directed them to a local accredited counselor and they went on a payment plan with all these credit card companies I'm sure none of which I thought they were ever going to see all their money\nBecause once your debt goes credit card debt goes above fifty percent of your annual income odds are very low you're ever going to be able to pay off the debt with their credit card debt was way past a hundred percent of income\nSo they sacrificed everything they could in their lives\nAnd made it work\nAnd in just under eight years John and his wife\nMade their last payment and paid off the entire hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in credit card debt today other than their mortgage which they are very little one versus the value of their house at this point\nYou know now it's been eleven years later\nThey are almost at free\nAnd living a life of frugality they were able to make it all happened the irony and I didn't say this to John and John if you are listening and hear this if you would call me eleven years ago\nI Would have told you that you had too much debt\nTo be able to pay it all off\nBut you had more faith in yourself and your wife and I would have in a situation where the debt total was so enormous\nAnd you made it happen and so\nIn the spirit of what John and his wife accomplish I Want you to know that if you find yourself because credit card debt levels are rising again at a very rapid rate you find yourself facing\nA lot of debt know that you don't give up that morning better ways to handle your money\nIf it's because you lost your job or whatever you ended up

thank you Michael you need a a magnifying glass to see the interest\nYou're earning on your savings right now is that accurate\nThat's absolutely right I'm looking at it what we get from our our credit union ah it's in some tests civil\nWhat's your credit union paying on savings a point two five\nOkay but still [laughter] still like five times with the big banks are paying on savings but it's pitiful compared to what you can earn now in the marketplace\n... I wanted to know what what we should do with a with the ... we have a we have two accounts both of them are administered by a financial planner or on a ...\nAnd uh but we have some money that we want to have on hand that we can get a hold yet not yet we we well we don't want to just let it sit there at less\nYeah so in my day to day savings rates are steadily rising\nAnd the rates you can earn in the country now are pretty much a at or above two percent\nAnd they're headed steadily higher towards three percent so versus one quarter of one percent what I Would do is average link your checking account at the credit union to a savings account at one of the online banks and start earning two percent or so\nAnd there there are now a bunch of FDIC insured account you're covered up to a quarter million dollars that you can open with one of the online banks\nAnd I'm looking right now like one that have all the advertisers right now Marcus it's paying one point nine percent American Express paying one point nine capital one one point eight five percent I'm One that I'm not familiar with is\nCalled I I go banking is paying two and a quarter\nAnother one called bank purely is paying two hundred quarter so you got the idea that it's pretty easy you just go if you want to see a list of all these different people\nGo to bank radio dot com click on savings rates and then with a lot of these you can just click and open an account right they're\nAll right and Lincoln your existing account fund it right away and bam your days of order earning a quarter percent are over and earning round two percent or so we'll get\nAnd John is with us on the Clark Howard show John you got a question about your mortgage let's see if I can be of help\nYes my wife and I will be set free probably within the next\nSix to twelve months and I didn't know what to do with some of that extra money that will have [noise] and our our dilemma this or the fork in the road is is should we poor as much as we can extra into our mortgage or knowing that we may move and the next\nFive years or so I'm staying a little to make some simple home improvements that allow our house to sell either quickly or for what it should be worth\nSo let me understand you're going to be that free except for the mortgage that if he wants right what's your mortgage interest rate\nIt is three point six\n... don't know in a rush to pay on the mortgage and having some rainy day money is always good\nTo be a hole in the case you mentioned to be able to do repairs or improvements to the home when you're going to market it or just for who knows what unexpected things happen in life but then I have a different question for you\nOr do you do when you're married\nYes are you and your wife both funding Ross IRAs\nUm I currently am um she is she's not she has maxed out her um T. S. H. or work\nWell good for her so yeah so I Would say that I Would take the surplus money when you have alone is inexpensive as you do and I would uh put your efforts into both Mac sitting out Roth IRAs\nOkay because what you want to do when you when you start having the good problem you're having where you have access money as you want to create steadily more cushion for the future\nMhm\nAnd she's already doing max into the threat of savings plan was just the best retirement plan anybody's got in the country\n\nAnd then a refresh my memory how're you saving\nA lot so on a ... eleven is so present in that I got a rock highway and uh hopefully a pension or even though it's\nFantastic I thank you for your ... thank you for your service to our country so you could each increase the tea SPs up to the max permitted or you could keep putting more money into the Ross either would be a great path\nAnd with you on a trend line of such an inexpensive mortgage there's no priority for you to rush on that three point six\nTo ...\nSo continued success to you and again thank you for your service which branch are you with\nUS Army reserves\nRight well I appreciate what you do for us thank you so much you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nNow she's in the midst of [laughter] [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nWash the new season of the man\nTo the [noise]\nOne of the most difficult questions ever asked\nKen it's been true since I went on the air in the mid eighties\nThat's last century Nineteen eighties is what do you do with a timeshare you're stuck with and it's today's Clark rages moment [noise]\n\n... just a moment [noise]\nTime shares or defective product whenever you have anything that you can buy but you can't sell\nIts a defect to product it is not a normal function of capitalism time shares don't work time shares really were okay\nGood companies a push so hard to sell them would be willing to buy them back from you they're not because they know they're selling you something uh basically no value\nI hear from people all the time desperate download a timeshare and over the last four years I've had an increasing number of questions from people who are being pitched by lawyers that the warriors are going to get them out a bit in return for paying a big retainer upfront to the lawyer\nOften to retain or will be five or ... thousand dollars\nWell now around the country according to the Orlando Sentinel a number of lawyers are facing fraud complaints including one of the biggest operators of this guy I've had questions about in the past named judges and Philips who has now been disbarred\nFor\nA committing fraud against people telling them they were going to be relieved of their obligation for time shares\nNow these legal action is going on against the lawyers around the country are all being spurred by the big time share developers so let's bring this full circle timeshare developers if you're so busy trying to get people\nTaken away from their profession or get people charged with the actions of fraud because they're trying to help people get out of the time shares don't you think the real thing here\nIs that you need to come up with the system where when people want to dump a timeshare you're there for them to dump it too\nBecause obviously a product that people buy bay cannot later cell is something people shouldn't buy from Hugh in the first place you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\n[laughter]\nJust may apply\nI'm like the opposite the devastation from hurricane Michael still being assessed\nYou have to search and rescue teams that had been out and the debris field what they're looking for is any kind of avoid space where a person could be trapped they've had the dogs out there as well or they're trying to account for raw or what could be between fifty and one hundred people who have gone missing a since the storm\nFox is my job and recovery efforts continuing in Virginia Georgia and Mexico Beach

here on the Clark Howard show where it's about you learning ways to keep more of what you may you may or may not have heard the news reports that a number of the nation's\nLargest banks are facing a very heavy barrage of cyber attacks right now attempts to hack into\nThe bank operating systems way beyond just trying to take over an individual account at the bank but in fact to disable\nTheir computer systems at the bank\n... nobody's saying but you can just assume that it's a state\nActor who would try to completely disabled or computer operation at a bank even according to federal officials maybe even two white the data clean on all account holders\nThese warnings coming from his office there is and the federal government I saw this on a Wall Street journal dispatch about this there's an office of critical infrastructure protection and compliance policy\nThat the Treasury Department that's a mouthful isn't it\nIt's very very freaked out about what's going on right now you know certainly assume it's the Russians or another foreign power or trying to mess with us Russians always the first suspect because\nThe evil ... and in charge but anyway banned the pass things the Russians have been up to I don't understand the Americans who don't\nGet how rotten terrible the Russians are under ... anyway I digress\nSo think of two things one\nIf a bank's database gets completely wiped out it is long term no real problem short term there are potential hassles so it's still a long term one of the things that has been implemented I don't remember how many years ago this was\nBanks and credit unions work under a buddy system where they all have and nobody really talks about this because it's doomed to the doomsday scenario what kinds of stuff but there is a\nCompanion bank or competitor that has a database backup that's never more\nThan twenty four hours old from their\nAnd in the event that something happened\nIt's where foreign actors able to completely disable the computer operations at a bank or credit union\nPeople will still be able to use their accounts with the other financial institution acting is host\nAnd for you and me after a cut over\nIt should be somewhat pretty much business as usual I guess records would be there'd be like a twenty four hour window of a missing data potentially\nSo which again is not normally the end of the world but two things come to mind with us if we were to receive a serious attack\nFrom the Russians the Chinese another foreign actor\nIran look at our list of potential enemies that would do this\nCould be North Korea I mean we got a lot of such potential suspects\nWind a lot of people never have any cash anymore cash for a very short window would become valuable having a small amount of cash available stored in a place in your home\nSmall I mean for a lot of people just for walking around money under a hundred dollars let's say\nHaving that prevail herbal particularly if you're somebody who never carries any cash at all you should have it when I travel you know I travel a roughly thirty weeks a year\nI carry even though I never use it I have a supply of cash with me not a huge amount but I have some cash that if ever I had a serious problem where I could not access accounts that I still have some cash to function with\nThe show [noise]\n\n\nMy name is Preston James I'd

have a an craving and or store or in Florida\nOkay well how can I Am service with your business\nWell I have a potential new customers is a a very large entity and the suit my contact with a company they had they had requested that I still in a an authorization slip so they could direct deposit me\nUm and what kind of threw me off was they're asking for my checking account or saving ... lover boats routing numbers and Social Security number and I just it alarm bells went off and and it's a pretty legitimate organization but\nBoy you're ... you're sure it's actually them like who like their car bottom call again here's sure it really is the um the company you're agency you're dealing\nWith it is the lady is the contact person that I met in person in my store I'm a set of you know it's a it's a new lender package with a W night at the direct deposit of treatment\nSo with large organizations is normal and routine now\nThat they pay electronically I can tell you it with my Web sites bit advertisers in a overwhelmingly have the exact same way that you're being asked to receive payment and that the only way they pay [noise] gotcha\nSo it is it is normal course of business with large companies and with a lot of government agencies that they're going to say you were like trying to tell you the advantage to you\nYou're likely to get paid quicker right and there's not going to be saying well well you were set up for payment you not get that payment you will know that right ah clearly\nAnd so the real test is as long as you are comfortable and confident that you're dealing with the actual real\nOrganization then I Would be comfortable doing the electronic payment\nDelta yeah just the alarm built up in a long time listener to claw in Lauderdale went off and I thought I'm going to check this out\nAnd you're doing the right thing by asking the question right so it's like with anything else where I talk about you know don't do this don't do that in this case I don't say don't do it but it's a matter of being really really careful who you are doing business with\nThat for individuals\nWhere you're asked to permit a C H where you pay somebody\nIn this method that has very high risk for you as an individual and I urge extreme caution\nAnd with any health club or a technology bill you don't want to allow people to come in and sweep into your bank account and take money from you or the services they supposedly rendered to you this is the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\nNo I'm portrait Jones junior and I like\nOn the attack in Kentucky I'm Jerry Thomas Fox News President Trump on the campaign trail again this time in Richmond, Kentucky to campaign for congressman Andy bars reelection as he has done in other rallies he went after the Democratic challenger in this case military veteran Amy McGrath\nIf you are and individual buying health coverage on your own\nFor the first time since the Obamacare exchanges started premiums on average around the country are going down for next year not up\nYou know during open enrollment you can shop around\nAnd see what's available but now insurers more coming back into the marketplace\nAfter a number of years of having less and less competition on the exchanges there are more insurers offering plans and that creates competition not everywhere in the country are prices going down but the general trend around the country\nIs prices are actually declining\nAnd you ... if you do buy your own individual plan the next open enrollment period starts November first and you have only a six week window to sign up for individual coverage for twenty Nineteen and\nThat's great news about premiums having not just moderated but started a trend line of declining we don't know if this is a one year thing who knows because nobody expected\nThis to be a release when the rates were released by the department of health and Human Services nobody expected their premiums around the country would decline and these are for a full\nUh Obamacare compliant plants meaning no exclusion for pre existing coverage for a all illnesses coverage for pregnancies all that so it is\nAnother bit of good news on the health care front where the news historically has not been so good Andrew is with us on the Clark Howard\nShow hello Andrew [noise] hey how are you great thank you Andrew you are moving towards the end up paying off your student loans is that right that is correct well what kind of journey if you've been on with that how ... then\nUm I Would I Would say it's been pretty rough of but I just try to focus pretty heavily on trying to get those paid off as soon as possible um but it has taken a lot of um a lot of work to do so and I had to make sacrifices but we're nearing the end so I'm pretty excited about it\nWell that is great news how much do you have left burdening you\n[noise] I got just over sixty one hundred at the moment [noise]\nOh that's fantastic because you know when I hear from people calling me about student loans usually it will be in the tens of thousands or probably one in five times there will be more than a hundred thousand dollars in student loans that someone's asking me about\nYeah I started at the right at about thirty two I'm a couple of years ago and so I've I'm nearing the end so it's a very great showing that\nWonderful well how can I be of service in this quest to be done with the student loan lenders\nSo the question I have is so I got just over the sixty one hundred and student loans and it's a right at four percent four point zero one percent interest on that [noise]\nI have a a little bit over seven thousand built up and just individual savings and so I'm I'm just I'm questioning do I just go ahead and erase the student loan it'd be done with it\nOr just continue it out and I'm looking at potentially make it easier last payment and march or April next year\nSo that it even if you did not um kill off your savings you'd still be done and another half here yes that's correct\nRight so that means you're a very determined savor your very careful with your money I Would go ahead and blow out the student loans and extend in early Christmas gift to yourself [laughter] okay\nBecause you're on that kind of trend line where you're paying five hundred or so a month towards this balance you're going to replenish her savings pretty quickly\nAnd getting to that goal line of getting rid of the student loans is so worth it with the slog you've been through reward yourself and wipe it out\nOkay [noise] yeah I appreciate that because I was the kind of the same thing same thought process I had as if I go at it and remove this now that just affects me in the long term so I could put all that extra money back into savings and the Cornish that and build it back up\nAnd pretty quickly to one thing though that I Want to make sure you're aware that record keeping by the student loan servicers is pitiful and you need to keep the documents showing that you have successfully paid off your student loans for guess how\nLong [noise] forever that is right for the rest of your life\nYou need to keep the proof because over the years it's been so disturbing to me when I hear from someone who's being hassled by a student loan collector on loans thing long since paid off even decades before\nAnd they have no way of proving they actually pay them off and Congress in its wisdom gave student loan collectors extreme powers where they don't even have to prove the validity of a debt\nAnd that's why having your proof of pay off is so key\n[noise] yeah I I I appreciate you reminded me on that I'll definitely make sure I I get that um when I Do get a clear it out\nAnd congratulations to you and your early Christmas gift to yourself\nThank you very much I appreciate the advice\nCertainly and Sam is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Sam yes Hi how are you wonderful Sam how can I be of service to you\nI'm lost I had a question for you or about a situation I have I'm a I have a nine month old baby and uh\nI Am a I have some money that he had received some monetary gift from family and friends and deaths have close to a thousand dollars for him and uh I'm considering either starting um yeah five twenty nine\nOr ... or for him or a loss I write for my wife uh and just use that money to fund that and hopefully find it in the future is that money that I would've looked at it the five twenty nine and then engage in Egypt for college we can go ahead and make that what draws for it and I\nCan only would draw your contributions you can't withdraw any earnings from the raw without causing problems for yourself or or your wife for herself but yes that's actually a very smart strategy and less anybody who gave gifts\nTo your young baby would really be mad at you for doing this I'm like what you're thinking of doing that you take the money to open a raw for your wife is the money's never needed\nFor your ah newborns college than the money continues to grow for your wife's retirement and so I think that's a great when it's the rock is tax free growth all through the years it's tax free and retirement but if\nYou're um infant and I didn't even ask you what's your infants name\nOr his name is Adam\nWell for Adam if Adam needs money for college\nThen at least that are nearly a thousand

coaster ride it's always tough ride when\nThe scary ride is down\nBut this is there's no way of predicting if this is the start of\nA bear market bear market is when the value of stocks overall drops twenty percent or more or even something was known as mild thing called a correction which has declined to ten percent or more but we've had\nA nearly unprecedented run that started in late winter\nOf two thousand and no early spring two thousand nine and it's gone on pretty much with just a few hiccups overt\nAlmost ten years nine and a half years this is extremely unusual and values of a lot of stocks by historical measurements are too high nothing like a\nFoolish bubble territory anything like that but stocks do over shoot on the upside and over shoot\nAs they come down it's just part of the emotional\nFactor involved with stocks plus a lot of trading now is computer based and so the moves in stocks can be a lot sharper in short periods of time just in the training session today stocks moved up and down up and down up and down\nAnd uh\nIf you look day by day who knows\nJust know that do\nNot panic about what you might hear reported or whatever the stock market was given artificial care for years\nAfter the banking scandals\nAnd the federal government did everything it could to reflect the economy so a certain amount of the value in stocks is fake value because if you think about it if you try to open a savings account for years and years you would earn nothing on your savings\nThis was all part of the process\nOf trying to keep capitalism functioning in the U.S\nAnd so now is interest rates\nSteadily climbed towards real levels stocks don't look quite as good and that's part of the fact of getting back to a more normal\nEconomic environment and so as a stock investor I'm changing nothing because I Know this is part of the game as it goes through cycles if there was money that I had an stocks that I knew I was going to need to use\nAnd the next few years I Would be nervous because that money shouldn't be in stocks\nBut everything in life is about knowing the risk based on the time that you can afford to take risk\nSo money that you are putting in let's say is most people do most people's involvement with the stock market is through a four one K. or raw data IRA\nAnd through a plan where you're invested in fines\nAnd if you're putting in each pay period or putting in regularly each month let's say in a Roth IRA\nDon't even Fred about any of this just remember that what happens today is pretty much irrelevant if you're ten or more years away from when you're going to need any of the money\nAnd you just keep going studies you go as long as the money you're putting aside in a retirement plan is well diversified well diversified what that means in simple English\nIs that having money in a variety of stocks not your employer zone fact the percentage like for you to have an employer's own stock in a four O. one K. is zero percent\nThat your money should be well spread out the easiest choice of investing boards you confuses she were intimidates you is going to target retirement fund the you're offered where you work for
