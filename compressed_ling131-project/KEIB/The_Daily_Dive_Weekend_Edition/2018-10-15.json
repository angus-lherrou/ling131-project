Southern California you live with Wendell it's seven fifty to wear sizes and everything it's not important [noise]\nUh joining us is Johnny venom for these last glorious\nSeven minutes on the radios are Johan us money yes he is a economics professor at red lens ... and he says\nThe sixty three percent of the tasks performed by workers in Redlands in riverside San Bernardino in Ontario areas could be automated in the near future too out of three working people inland\nCould be losing their jobs the automation and the next five to ten years sir this is a serious serious situation now it's interesting mo was talking about this\nIt's on his show and we'll bring that up after the top of the hour but uh LA Times or Melanie Mason wrote this piece on on the University of Redlands says this is the scenario for the next governor has got to address um we know that in the two thousand sixteen presidential election\nHillary Clinton brought this up as well that an awful lot of jobs are going to disappear from automation is going to be a serious problem in America and the rest of the world you when I have discussed this before\nWhat is the solution\nI wouldn't worry too much about this oh you don't start or shall I that thing will happen right I I don't\nThink the implementation won't be as universal and as fast you know the the way they're taping this overnight it's going to happen even\nThough we know we know that you know true but it but it is imminent it's calming\nIt is um yeah but it won't be coming at the same that green like you saw a piece that were placed the coolest secretary right you have to understand these things cost money yes yes it is not a nation of what we're finding out and it's not cheap right\nIt is and so that I think it'll be by the greed\nSecondly um [noise] I I looked at it this way as well they don't want it in your article you've sent to me was one of the biggest myth or waiter or waitress and I I Would say I would be skeptical and I for one reason [noise]\n'cause I look at the fast food place in which where the minimum wage goes above the level\nRight and make a a more affordable right where the business and so what you're going out with your date right aptly that with your day to deal with a robot want want that personal experience\nThat you know unless it's like some exaggerated Lee robotic thing yes\nNo I mean you're not that I Want to go any even at even at a at a ... they just say Chili's court right God awful lot of corporate ... they're not going to replace the whole thing like care right because they sort of like with how\nRetailers are fighting back with Amazon with a more personal experience I think what's going to happen in the future when you go to a grocery store instead of the person being at the cashier you could have people who are going to be to help you you know you know their personal shopper\nAlthough all over Southern California people are reaching for their heart meds from that that statement but okay go ahead\nWell I I was getting at is that what they're going to be paying more to the experience I think that um H. and it just going to change the whole dynamic will be more capitalism the concept the work or even companies you know what the previous segment we talked about lowering the barrier event tree\nRight hey pretty industry music is going to do the same thing I think were smaller businesses that it's going to be a tool and a large company and what you can smaller competitors anymore\nRight [laughter] okay okay I I mean I'm Still\nLaughing at the idea of walking into Ralph ... having super helpful color X. like feel your basketball every every one of those rubbers cracking up going man this guy's never been to a supermarket now but\nI don't I have to end up telling yeah they're going to have to change the way the story design\nIt oh I I I think in ... you want to know what I think the the future of shopping is going to be is that you send in your order over the Internet and they deliver it to you\nI I mean I think I think that's you know it's interesting that it it too and to make to further this point of view let's assume that what the Ford Motor company believes is gonna happen\nHappens in the private ownership of automobile starts to dwindle that nobody really wants the aggravation of car insurance or upkeep\nSo everything gets delivered where you ... and lift everywhere you go where you take public transportation Walker you ride a bicycle that nobody wants to own a car any more if they can afford it sectors of the matter is Johnny sick about this\nIn by the year two thousand thirty nearly three quarters of Americans are going to live in cities All right so\nWe we may not need a lot of the stuff that we have now especially in in Los Angeles we become more neighborhoods centric more neighborhood friendly\nI I Would look at it this way yeah\nDemographics are changing them are getting older the workforce is shrinking the AI and automation is going to replace those who are retiring cannot be replaced yeah it's happening in Japan right it's going to happen here\nOf course yeah no they pre say just in pretty much every way cage included so that's\nHow it is I wouldn't say that let's say with the cheating I G H go ahead right I Would say\nCompany I was a war that requires a lot of stuff you yeah you know concentrate a critical thinking yeah a computer can spit out data\nSure but a ... a computer can't make a connection between two disparate points if it's not inside the wild I I Know that\nI got a chuckle when they said that robots are we doing surgery\nAnd I'm going to tell you right now I wouldn't want to rely on a low but they may know how hard they function and everything sort right by your doctor knows how to marry you operate they've opened your either your heart surgeon cardiologist array\nRight you know what to do this is true no I mean you know you're you're talking to someone who's married to a birth nurse\nYou know and and you figure like well no yeah no I mean there are lots and lots of a coup for months that exist in the birth of a child that didn't exist exist when I was born All right if you look it but but the fact of the matter is\nGrandma and grandpa are going to have to sell their house 'cause they can't afford property taxes anymore fright oh if they could have seen two thousand and Eighteen and\nWhy grandma and grandpa are living in California now it is not property that not just about everything\nOut here but the fact\nIs is that commercial property should have never been part of this but it is okay so how you get around\nWhat how commercial entities get around this is that they don't appear to sell to one another they sell shares of stock\nIntra company wise in other words I'm not selling use a property you were buying fifty one percent of my corporations value in oh was part is that you end up with my ... yes that's how I could be it's very clever [laughter] so\nThat being said um\nHow ... what's your take on proposition ten on the repeal of Costa hawk\nI [noise] that is something I've stayed away from completely why because I have enough to worry about elsewhere [laughter]\nIt's one of those things where I don't have the motion all uh well yeah that's what it comes down to be there there are certain things I can care about the other things I just can't the gas tax I barely care about rioters did it but I barely care about\nOne thing that bugs me about the gas tax okay ... or not not the gas tax but the argument against it as people are ranting and raving look at what a gallon of gas costs now it's like yes it's gone up thirty more cents a gallon\nIn the last couple of months yes it has that has nothing to do with the gas tax us to do with an idiotic foreign policy aimed at Iran okay that's why gasoline is going up but not the gas tax and they're not even\nSaying how the whole Saudi Arabian issue going on right now\nWhich could start which could impact what are the Saudis threatening now well there were basically threatening to take us back to Nineteen Seventy three they're saying\nIf you keep pursuing this a ... thing the moon burger Jamal ... thing we're going to raise the price of a barrel of oil to two hundred dollars a barrel my and I got to tell you something if you made me Donald Trump for a day series of wherever the president of the United states but Sam Donald Trump\nIf I were trumped by say go do it\nDo it at all for it you know all that blow you you're so keen to do this do it I'm not going to stand in your way you want to commit economic suicide by all means you do that because you know it ends up happening is every other oil producer in the world quadruple production and your crap out of luck pal\nAnd our oil reserves here in the United states are not in the same position we can position as the word Nineteen\nSalary billions and billions and billions of gallons of gasoline yes oil here you know I Do not understand why Mr Trump doesn't call their bluff he\nMay but I think this is where we talk to our country a conflict of interest because he has personal economic\nInterests which are tied up yeah no son in laws is in the pocket of the Saudis we understand is\nThat being said I don't think that that should not make any difference to him from President of the United states you're going to raise it to two hundred dollars a barrel Gulf\nWar nobody's going to buy your product that you know you'll be going broke real soon it you know we don't with Saudi Arabia is balance sheets look like they are drowning in debt in that country but let me ask a hypothetical question why is that Trump won't treat\nThe Saudis in the same way that he was treating China were basically say why do we go ahead and have this trade war here\nOr or I'm gonna rename NAFTA and I'm going to go to war with Canada and Mexico it's not like they're our neighbors or anything you know it's because there are no financial conflicts of interest that does is if he stood up to the Saudis they would for like a card table and he would probably have ... support chiefly certainly have mine okay\nYou know and he certainly of yours you certainly have it if every Democrat Republican America it'd be like finally high time in American presidents ... told the Saudis where they could shove it\n... that's a great point if only because this goes back many administrations either ... or say yeah I Know that goes back most of my lifetime goes back\nTo the Carter doctrine Jimmy Carter said nothing can interfere with the supply of oil ever again after we sat through the the gas lines of Nineteen Seventy four which is when you were what three [laughter] it was\nI was four but I Do remember it oh not quite as vividly as I Do [laughter]\nI remember the gas lines I remember the rationing I remember the cars lined up almost down the street oh yeah no it was ... you had to get gas on certain days depending on your license plate others correct yes I remember\nEven odd days but we're not like that now you know we have reserves we have ... and ... and we can adjust accordingly if we have to you know plus two hundred dollar rebel or a two hundred dollar for a barrel of oil hey that's only going to have some more electric cars getting built by all means right what's\nRight and yeah a lot of diminishing returns I mean you know we're all going to be on fossil fuels\n... they were so unique and ... and so unusual and so on and also they do albums no members aid for I only had four um St consequential\nTwo albums are three consequential the last one did nothing for them but that's that's not the issue the issue with them as they are the first musical act in which videos were absolutely integrated in what they did agree okay so for that and for nothing else you can make the case that well yeah DeVos\nThird Janet Jackson yes yeah ... John Prine no okay cross divert\n[noise] ball [laughter] I Know you're out of your mind [laughter] you have no validity\nWhy ... one of the most influential actually the last fifty years how can you say they don't go I don't know if they're the most ... one of the most in I'm Sorry electronic pop yeah I I get that\nI Know but you know to ... know humane league know Africa bombarded halo I disagree with that\nThey were part of hip hop was already there because we're already break dance world planet rock okay that broke all kinds of grounds that is based on robot spy craft work rock rock to the planet rock okay yeah don't stop\nI Lived in the east coast I heard it before you did oh I'm not so sure about that alright LL Cool J yes\nYes I Do know yes career wasn't that long are we supposed to be starting to sixteen years old Oh yes I I like some of his stuff he might be arguably one of the greatest solo rap artist of all time\nHowever however we must show props to our ill Conrad Mr toilet sharp who's not with us tonight yeah most of the L.
