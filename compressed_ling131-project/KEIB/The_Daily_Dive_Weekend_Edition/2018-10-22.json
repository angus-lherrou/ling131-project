if you would do to more segments because we're only halfway through our stuff\nOh I can do one more thing than that then I got to help pops what is medically\nI see okay so after the top of the hour we'll do one or to try to get my apologies\nAlright yeah I I Know it's from the sun you out of nowhere but we got an awful lot of stuff to cover [noise] um we've talked to a blouse many of the propositions over the last few weeks or so\nAnd probably next week we'll go over all of them and be comprehensively because the elections of the six then that's the last show before the election is next week right I think so\nI'm at any rate uh no actually it isn't it is not correct we've won more so with ... next week will be normal but then after that we'll do a a\nAn entire hour to the propositions one of the more interesting propositions John his proposition twelve which is to decide whether or not or the laws on cages for farm animals are acceptable or are you aware of this\nYeah ... you had a similar one a couple years prior right ... pilot that right well we'll be an interesting uh\nBecause they'll call me ... you you had to jump in the price of a fight\nDepending where you were to thirty created Seventy one percent\nOh was that was an astronomical ... settled out it it yeah what\nDoes that proposition twelve would tighten the laws in cages for farm animals requiring more space\nBans to seal beach California from cabs raised reveal are breeding pigs unless the farms that raised them the minimum standards for Kansas eyes banned the sale of eggs from hands that are kept in cages don't meet similar standards\nI mean I understand that this is\nA very well meaning act and in some ways\nMakes a lot of sense but I also I always when whenever propositions like just come up I realize there are an awful lot of people in California that will go to the ends of the earth to circumvent the ... are they enforceable and therefore are they sensible\nWell a lot of major stores and restaurants\nAre going towards that I think mainly for ... typically speaking for marketing\nWe sure looks good yeah\nYou know because I think at the end of the day I don't think that the McDonald's given them at the chicken is in a small box or they you know it ranged free\nNo idea what they care about is what their shareholders thing\nRight sure um [noise] you know it's an animal

three square feet of space for each calf race reveal okay\nIt's going to happen\nYou already have farms that are already doing this show they'll they'll be okay and they'll continue to share the California are you going to have farms that will meet that date right but probably like fate that decade after you get you get that get that for\nSome farm that is that possible right by that time so they're going to curtail or they can get away with it and then they go through a third party\nAnd and also I mean it'll take a look at at at at states that are far more lax on stuff like this like in North Carolina where they're barely any regulations whatsoever in the rivers are just completely filed with the runoff from these massive factory pig farms to me that is\nA really really compelling issue\nWith it you know we we California should start looking at what is the environmental impact of all the stuff you know are if if our fellow Americans in other states aren't going to pay attention and we're just going to end up driving our farms out of business you know no\nNo no you you have a limited if if your population was half the size would say a possibly not okay but you have such a large market right at you and there are enough farms that will make\nThe ... but you will see it in the media and the short term price of exit other me actually\nGo up right or wrong term but I Know it given the cost of housing and other item to the average American or California goes through the last thing they want you know California\nCould be the one extreme layer is what you just mentioned in North\nCarolina that that the middle but I I Would say there's a fight twenty twenty to\nA lot of these farms do reach that there has to be an extension because you are having a lot of farm or even gets enough they could find them but be prepared for a trial in shipments look at your last one\nRight they didn't even specified for education right and you add a thirty five percent dry either look this up out of curiosity right\nOr the universe for producing university did a study on this and and and they said it was a thirty five percent drop in the amount of eggs and during the state [noise]\nSure I mean okay can happen it's possible and also\nYou know we pride ourselves on being somewhat conscientious on this on these matters and it's good and I also suspect that given the habits and the taste of younger Americans I think the ... the entire market for view is simply going to age itself out anyway\nJohnny can you hang on through the top of the hour for one final right okay that
