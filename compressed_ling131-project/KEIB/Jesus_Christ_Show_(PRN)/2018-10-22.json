every single Sunday no problem same time same place\nAnd you can follow us on Twitter at Jesus' show at Jesus' show\nWe were talking with Jeanie Jeanie there are now your husband or as is having issues with the fact that the babies are born with with disabilities and this and Pete's on his face\nThis in ... in faith for food but does he have faith is there a okay so he wrestles with it doesn't keep them from having face but it it he wrestles with it right\nIn it for very far from ... somehow I don't know well a lot of health I I've got a cat\nIt is normal and it is healthy for him to question these things because it shows compassion on his part and and that's a good thing um so the question becomes you know I guess academically it becomes will you know why does God allow these things right and not just reach in well it sounds simple\nUm but it's kind of like when you start looking at things that you don't like in the United states and you start going I you know I don't like the way that person thinks oh I don't like the way they act I wish we could just bands that then\nWhat ends up happening is what in the United states or the constitution says that once you start banning that than\nThe things you can build you believe in can be banned as well and it starts this whole cycle right that breaks down the entirety of the system so you have to let people be who they are within reason as long as it doesn't cause danger harm to anyone else if you allow people to be who they are even if you disagree now you stretch that\nOr to God looking over the universe and everything in it and saying what I Want are creatures that can love and the only way creatures can truly love is to allow them the option not to love\nSo are the only way you can allow creatures truly to love God or anything else the the only reason your husband knows that you love him is because you come home to him every night by choice\nThat you ... if you had a gun to your head it wouldn't be love right you'd just be doing it because he was forcing you so God force people to do right it's no longer doing right it's like the uh\nUh you know putting a murderer in solitary confinement he doesn't murder anymore right he's not good because if you had the opportunity you would murder right so just because uh you know just because you took\nA the morality out of it or you assume that you you know uh keep a this prisoner I'm so we can't kill that he now he's a better person no it just means he doesn't have the opportunity or the choice that's not better that's without any morality so\nGod in order to to create a a creature that has that can truly love has to give them an option not to love so what these creatures do some of them go towards gone\nSeeking God seeking God's will and God's love and loving God and therefore trying to abide by the rules of God which are the rules of the universe truly\nAnd I'm a when it comes to pollution or drugs or things like that um they would uh shun them but then there are those that look to cut corners to make more money to build a their empire to do all kinds of things are to get high to do whatever that\nAh pollutes the genetic line\nAnd then what ends up happening is you have mutations now not seeing the parents of some of a of a disabled child have done something there's themselves you're talking about it could be generations and generations generations of a a a go of people that they don't know\nI'm the purpose of that is to understand that everybody is responsible for one another and in in doing that you know it keeping in mind that there is the percentage\nOf of Americans that are disabled is approximately about Seventeen percent and of that percentage of disabled people about fifty percent of them are born that way so it it it it makes you one say does it is a disabled person worth less than you\nOf course not no of course not so what he looks at is the quality well why does this happen at all and and why would you know why would allow this it has to be allowed in the process of things because in order to eliminate that I'm very boy that possibility would be to have to take away\nThe consequences of anything that people did wrong and you have to allow consequences in life 'cause that that helps build character it's like um if you think about all the wonderful things in life that you know ability courage all these things\nDo you need those don't exist without adversity do they uh you know a fireman or a firefighter cannot be a hero without a fire or some sort of adversity same with a law enforcement or anything like that so the balance of adversity\nAnd faith in strength and ability and all these things love versus a indifference or even hate that these things only exist in this world in this way because this is not the best world Jeannie it's the best way to the best world which is heaven\nHome in lines are helped me find them back home in my area and the handle any

have a feel are they called quest okay and it's a reference to first Corinthians ...\nAnd a verse Nineteen and twenty um and the reason I'm Wondering about if I have a very fundamentalist Christian family\nWho are sometimes they just drives me crazy\nWait whoa this is hard to believe are you saying that there's sometimes there's fundamental Christians that can be oh I don't know pushy ad is really hard to believe that a ... a little I have to say okay well\nAh some of some of the fate of the things that I've overheard them directed me for example is a uh uh the the Hurricane Katrina was God's wrath ... people in the world\nOh boy uh the earth is only five thousand years old\nOverlooking dating is the devil cool oh boy\nOh but I Will agree that carbon fourteen dating not the best way to do anymore it's gotten better um we have a much better tools to to date scientifically than carbon fourteen but go ahead\nYeah I'm I have one cousin though I Love the early uh who has made state with regard it became very demeaning faith um and to quote a all the tea too and go above it varies\nUm it's all about some garbage oh said that in front of his uh his entire folding\nLaid off of like school and we were on the you know or or educational my wife lived a very important for a life of ritual\nSure experiences are alive and I have\nA written a ham regarding matter of his response\nOf um uh the wife of the education of garbage and I really mean if he's stuck on the hill and he froze back out of the first ... of of a chapter one where a verse vie to\nUh I Will destroy the wisdom otherwise and the clever enough of a clever I Will have a five and ... twenty of ends up with has a God they fully the was the love of the world\nIn other words uh educational of a equivalent to a clever though and I would like to\nKnow what a better of her case of that is and is there a I Am a figure of truth okay as a Christian and I\nI feel that my uh you never stop earning a ... sixty seven years old retired and I never thought of software to 'em but is there any place or elsewhere in the Bible that promotes educational her say oh\nAbsolutely but let's look at this and let's look at this is a is big as we possibly can a first\nUm I joked with you a about a fundamentalist because\nThe truth of the matter is they're all all kinds of people involved in the body of Christ yeah and I came in I died for every single one of them and there's going to be those that have different hang ups those have different desires of the way they worship\nAnd I poked fun because I think the importance of the ... of Christ and not take themselves seriously but the word of God seriously\nSo I'm saying that I Want Christians to look at themselves and go am I being closed minded to not receive or I'm standing firm on a principle that is important because there's a difference you can be ... bull headed\nAnd not receive in that I don't want I don't I don't want that near my name at all I don't want people are associating with me\nBut what I Do want is somebody who is confident or in their world view and will stand upon that and defend it\nAnd I don't feel no they're not here to defend themselves you know fairness and to ah make their case\nBut in just in the context in which you're telling me I don't feel they're being fair no I I agree with you that's not very fair and there are a lot of Christians that do that that's my hope for this program is to shed light on things and help people reason three things strangely enough\nThat's directly from scripture scripture says come let us reason together it says to worship God with all of your heart all of your soul and all of your mind a Christian should not have to leave their brain at the door\nOr when they come into the kingdom of God now diverse in which you're referring to is although your um this is a family member\nYeah I'm more than a lot of the three people we don't live near the I'm there all the all of a of a and another state okay well the way I Do love your statement earlier that we are truth seekers absolutely that\nThat really uh uh uh if I let them go out there that have made an impact\nOtherwise who cares then the new ones right now you can you can both be wrong but you can't be right the purpose of truth the scripture throughout you see things where people say God is love absolutely but God is truth yeah\nAnd it's not some false truth it's not you know the truth is relatives all of that is garbage truth is not relative truth is truth\nThey that statement doesn't even make any sense\nSo there if there is truth it's absolute truth if there's absolute truth you know it and you can learn it and you can live at so\nWhen you're talking about um first Corinthians chapter one versus
