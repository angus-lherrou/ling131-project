ago and now at twenty three years old\nIt has grown to quite a large position I'd been investing for a few years now with my own money\nBut I've never known what to do with this massive position because that has a very low cost basis do I sell some of it down and put it to work somewhere else do I let it sit and continue to reinvest there's not a ton of growth opportunity but Coca Cola pays a

think part of it is how confident are you and Coca Cola shares five plus years from now but in the meantime I agree is rotted can't hurt to sell bits and pieces selling stages as you have other ideas

'cause everybody knew how old they were you know in the Bible\nI won't tell you this there's nothing wrong with holidays are they the holy days of the past no hum are a lot of them\nA ... at ... at bare minimum embellished by the greeting card companies absolutely but that doesn't mean that you can't celebrate a mother or someone's burst or any of these things I think\nThat uh there are some groups or some may consider them fringe groups or that or take this to a degree where they don't celebrate anything and it's a it's to me that is more militant and on Christian\nIn the the attitude of celebrating all things I mean for this one ... uh five sixteen Eighteen rejoice always\nPray without ceasing give things and all circumstance where this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you there's there's ... ... do you need a special day no but then you could say the same about the Sabbath you don't need a special day for that either it's just a matter of taking the time and\nAnd rejoicing and celebrating people and sometimes you\nIt's easier to put something on the calendar\nOr than it is because people put it off all the time\nYou do it with relationships of any kind you do it with friendships with getting together for coffee or tea or lunch or dinner or whatever it might be you put them off constantly\nAnd sometimes it's easier just to get something on the calendar and said this is the day that we're going to celebrate mothers or fathers or family or friends or whatever it might be\nAnd some of them may feel silly and you don't have to celebrate them and yes you can go back to the origins of Christmas and Easter and you can look that they weren't celebrated by the early church and of course I wasn't born in December\nUm it wouldn't make sense biblical e based on what was taking place during the time on my birth all those things absolutely true however there's nothing wrong with taking a time\nPutting it on the calendar and the case of things like Christmas and Easter they were pagan holidays during that time\nOr the early church wanted to try and root those big and holidays out so they kinda plopped\nMy birth and my resurrection into those slots to try and squelch or squash the pagan a religious ceremonies or uh festivals for things like that and that was the way of the early church trying to\nKind of get their way I get all that but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't even matter there's pagan uh ties in uh when it comes to\nChristmas and it comes to Easter the the bunny rabbits the eggs all that stuff comes from pagan roots are big Christmas tree itself I'm is tied to pagan roots but it doesn't matter because that's not what people are celebrating\nAnd so to take a time of celebration to enjoy any more than people are

gods and\nThere are theories are based on similar notions the problem is that\nUh the timeline is based on the timeline is when it becomes difficult when you're dealing with fallen angels\nAnd the concept of fallen angels are you talking about revelation twelve step in through nine talking about the battle with Michael in his angels fighting against the dragon or\nSatan there's no specific time as a matter of fact when something's happening in heaven and that concept it's really outside of time so if you're using that as a\nBasis to say okay well it started here and there are similarities no doubt similarities may point to a\nStandards through point where you have a belief system starting here moving through here some parts are taken some parts are removed some some of its polluted some of it's added to what have you I get that and that has most certainly taken place but to try and track trace it back entirely\nTo the fallen angels might be a little difficult from a historical or timeline perspective\nBut absolutely no doubt\nThat with the falling of the angels and the angels coming to earth as it says in scripture says in that very scripture revelation twelve seven through nine talks about or that he was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him\nThat in that process that there there wasn't counterfeit and destruction and things that went along with it so I get the big picture of where you're going and how you look at it looks like\nHere you had a face and then how you have those\nThat would be motivated to destroy that face\nCausing pollution and\nCounter fits in all these things that would twist it around and that you say that you can kind of traced that back but I think there's you're dealing with other things that are outside the timeline of history\nAnd then within the timeline of history and that poses kind of a problem to figure out as to what took place when and where man stands in in that whole\nAs well

them about a ... in Corinthians about a is there to be up for the bodies ... present when lord but it also says in Hebrew is that\nYour um it's appointed for men to die once and then the judgment so there is no there is no place for what is referred to as to some sorrow that cycle of life there is no\nPlace for reincarnation reincarnation was never in scripture uh there's no place for it it doesn't fit and uh and and so that doesn't make sense with Christianity or\nEven within the church you know I I Know so little not out there but he does in order to keep\nAll that stuff you'll never know so it's basically this is one toward that on that uh\nGeorge ... a lovely man a very smart man and he does have very interesting I guess on coast to coast I Am a but but his his job and his focus is not the same as the focus on the show so so ... he's looking at things from a broader\nSpectrum then this this program is we're very focused on the Christian Judeo Christian precept position and the Christian theology and specific so uh we obviously have a different point in and when it comes to that so in this particular case\nThere is nothing in scripture that allows for that reincarnation and there's no need for it now there can be those that argue or Catholic brothers and sisters\nArgue that there is a purgatory but there are different but there's different beliefs in that that has changed throughout the years as well as to what that means what's taking place\nUm but as far as mainstream Christianity or Protestantism um they differ so mainstream Christianity deeper Catholicism in ... in that same basket they're going to get run to defer\nI'm Still keep that in mind there's differences are very quickly so we can make sure that we're shared everyone else you had one more question you want to do a ask\nJust quick uh own events are Katherine calling probably the most probably no other local evangelists ... yelling powers I went to Catholic Church going up on stage for everything in ... in college\nWell my wife or something you know I mean I [laughter] I Know this is why when actually\nIt's just I mean it's like why does that manifest and it's really true I don't want to present only under ... here I\nDon't get I mean I get it out [noise] Mike\nIt depends because and this is nuts or specifically speaking about anyone who refers to himself as a faith healer a lot of that is garbage a lot of it ties in to the tricks and whatnot and psychology that takes place during\nA a group experience like that that doesn't mean that it can't take place of course there are gifts to the spirit that do take place never ceilings that could take place\nTo this day but that is God's will ... will up an individual or um their ability God will speak through somebody like a profit and got ... through somebody like a healer\nBut it's not done in the the ethical way the way it often is portrayed in Christianity across the board there are many of those that um you know act as if they are faith healers and really it's amount of the tricks and people get caught up\nIn something the same way you can watch a movie that you know was absolutely fake that it is actors that you've seen many times before you could start to cry or get angry or a beef thrilled by the outcome\nBecause emotionally you're having experience with those uh other people in the theater while watching something so you have to be careful as to what your experience is your experience should always be lining up with scripture and things of God and it should never be to the glory of an individual other than God\nI'm you shouldn't have to pay for such a thing these types of things\nI should be thought of a before you you go and experience and things because they can be a quite emotional\nAnd um\nYeah you\nCan catch you up in that kind of overall attitude and and excitement and you can think that it's spiritual when it's just psychological something to think about a brother and not be lost in that\nObviously a Christ is talking there about the children being in heaven um and this is an argument that goes back and forth this is a place where really safe comes in and you have to trust that when uh the ugliness of something like a child dying takes place that a God\nA God has a way of balancing these things out that really accountability and salvation is based on

after all\nWell I'll tell you the guard Ken's first I'm very proud of you because you push through the enemy had you at every turn on that one he would have loved nothing more than you to turn that car around and not have your daughter baptized\nIt would've been a huge victory in his eyes\nAnd you push through it there were a lot of things that are going to take place you drive on roads every day that people have lost loved ones on every day\nYou've gone to hospitals where people have died you've gone to restaurants where people have been a it's gotten sick or might have choked on something\nDeath is a part of life it's everywhere but you need\nTo see the significance of the instance and what's taking place rather than the fact that there's a history of something you know if that child died because there was something in that water\nI wouldn't blame you but because of a freak accident or someone dying\nOr to not use you know there's a reason that it's the same place this particular church or churches in general in that area may use this for you said it was a Christian camp or a a and now it's a Christian baptism\nThat they're just you know it's a body of water in the area it's it's normal for it to be used in different purposes but what I Want you to take from this is the fact\nThat things aren't evil unto themselves\nThere isn't an evil thing in the world evil is when morally neutral things uh have bad relationships\nSo for instance when a child is in a unattended or doesn't swim well water can be evil in the relationship between that person in the water and they can drown\nBut in a baptism that's controlled and uh there are people around to watch and it's done structurally um it can be a beautiful thing about the awakening of someone's spirit yeah\nThe acknowledgement of their face so likewise if someone broke into your house heaven forbid with a gun that's a bad thing but if right behind them law enforcement broke into your house with a gun that's a good thing\nAnd so I Want you to stop you know not to see this lake is something good or bad\nIt was depending on how was experienced that was good or bad but the lake itself is not evil and it isn't cursed\nUh-huh or anything like that situation and ... it's very sad that you had to witness that is such a young age or at all and it's going to be a you know an indelible mark on your life forever\nBut I Hope that it will be equally as indelible the moment and the beauty of watching your daughter being baptized and confirmed her place uh in our heart for God in front of all those people\nThat you should have power wouldn't you say\nYeah that that I just couldn't believe it\nOr you know some good has come of it because I just thought it would be a paramedic after that extra mile ... three of\n'em so it did change my life forever but it also you know after hanging out at about ... ... I'll never forget that day in my life that was a day that just stood out to me and I felt that\nYou know God was talking I mean I think it just was really strange thing to go through what\nWas he saying um [noise] he was saying to let this go you were saying don't harbour any guilt it wasn't my fault you know I was a child and I didn't rescue him I I panic\nBut you know you didn't have the ability to rescue him\nRight again\nSo it can't be your fault\nRight and I and I took a long time to to realize that it wasn't my fault and you know just to let it go I mean just to say goodbye to him or to pray for him and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jesus Christ Show (PRN)", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "15"}
