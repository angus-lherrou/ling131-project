the label pushed it as hard as they could\nIt just had no uptake no one wanted to hear the song I'm One of the few thousand people who bought the vinyl record um was a fifth grader named Peter forward and Peter Ford was the son of a Hollywood actor named Glenn Ford who was in a movie called black or jungle\nAnd I'm One a day or Richard Brooks the director of this movie visited the forwards house in ... in um uh I think it was Malibu\nI'm Beverly Hills and a said I Need a jumped jive tune to kick off a this movie it's a movie that juvenile delinquency it's a bit like a rebel without a cause\nUm and uh I Need I Need a a age assigned a kickoff this movie um and Glenda father says I only like a Hawaiian folk music to this is not going to work out for you my son however is really into like this weird new loud music\nI'm the son Peter ... director Richard Brooks a stack of vinyl one of the vinyl records in that stack or had other word bill Haley on it\nUm and and rock on the clock ended up playing at the beginning of black or jungle in the middle of black or jungle at the end of backward jungle in Nineteen fifty five and it does only then three weeks after the movie came out the song became the number one song in the country the first rock and roll song to ever hit number one and billboard and\nThe second best selling song in American history after white Christmas by Bing

biggest hit of the century so yes luck\nPlays a role timing plays a role no world\nIn which the biggest hit at the century in which that song outcome rests on the\nLittle shoulders of a ... year old a fifth grader boy named Peter forward in Nineteen\nFifty five you can only discussed that world through the lens of probabilities\nAnd likelihood Z and not formulas and inevitability is let's go back to Facebook because\nTime is short amount of time as a company I'm certainly when it went public and uh it grew in popularity to the point where people's grandparents were getting on Facebook and there were plenty of smart people at the time say well that's a it's over now for Facebook because\nNo longer the cool place for younger people it's no longer the popular players is only continue to rise in popularity when you looked at Facebook today\nUh what do you see in terms of\nA company that is not only one of the biggest public companies in the world it is one of the most popular stocks it's one of the most popular businesses um how is it able to maintain the popularity is that the biggest challenge they face or when I when I look at Facebook\nI see one of the most impressive companies in American history that is going through a very serious existential crisis at the moment that doesn't really understand what it is\nAnd what it's built it knows that what it's built is valuable but it doesn't know what it's capable of it doesn't yet understand how to talk about it so\nThe the best way to understand Facebook briefly to me\nUm is as a piece of information infrastructure the same way and a national highway system is a piece of transportation and infrastructure Facebook owns\nPractically no content it owns the proverbial roads on which the content reaches consumers Senate magnificent job of stitching together just proverbial nation which is actually\nInternational this international policy\nI'm an ... but in doing so\nIt's not only created an incredible place for advertisers to reach people and people to reach people\nBut it hasn't understood that other equivalent with roads which is that when a state builds roads ... also hires police officers to make sure the roads are safe\nAnd erect signs to make sure the cars don't hit each other and paint lines and do the decades of thinking required to build the a safe and truly effective national highway system\nAnd Facebook right now has become profitable for it's become self aware in a weird way um and what you're seeing right now with the fake news crisis from the twenty sixteen election\nAnother fake news crisis with yesterday's or Las Vegas shooting where it turned out that Facebook was heavily promoting um I Believe it was either\nA right wing American propaganda and or Russian propaganda toward I mean it's a and it's trending new section um\nAnd is now buying advertisements are in Burma\nTo in newspapers to teach 'em Burmese people how to read Facebook soy joke today on Twitter I was like this is a grotesquely ironic version of Amazon getting back into brick and mortar like Facebook buying advertising in print to teach print readers how to read\nOr a Facebook I'm\nSo this ...\nAnd then and then on top of that you have sort of Mark Zuckerberg's sound like semi political semi presidential I'm tour around the country to like talk to farmers in Iowa about like who they are and how they live um\nI think I think you you put this all together and you you have an incredible\nAmazingly successful company I'm at the crossroads of an existential crisis not understanding exactly what it's built and how to control what it's built um because ... founded this company thinking I'm that connecting the world which would would simultaneously serve a dual purpose it would um\nOr be good for humankind as ... as the connections between individuals have have always been according to his philosophy and it would be insanely\nA profitable because connecting people tend to be profitable\nUm intends to to uh grow um GDP\nI'm ... but I think he's not realizing that there's lots of people um who are are not good\nAnd they according to Facebook's algorithms are just as valuable as the people who just want to talk to their uncle and on and share CNN story um so I think that for inclusion I Would say that Facebook's biggest problem going forward is not economics\nIt's politics I'm no company that has so quickly achieved what is essentially ... monopolistic power industry\nNo company like that wants to be on a one of the New York times Washington Post\nEvery single time there's a national news story and it turns out that they've given enormous backing to some piece of fake news um I don't the Trump Administration is going to be the one ah to regulate them [noise] um [noise] but you look at some of the people who wanted to be the next president United States they're Democrats and a lot of them um are kicking as there\nBoogie Man not least

controversy this particular days particular celebration is it in fact necessary\n\nOr the roots of Halloween found in paganism [noise] yep absolutely no doubt about it does this automatically mean Christian that a Christian camp partake in any part of a Halloween celebration of course not\nI Know there will continue to be disagreements but what is based on fear of and ignorance\nVersus the reality\n\nThat's what's important because the more you do something just based on fear and ignorance\nThe the less substantive your face looks like to others\nAnd you may feel well I don't care what it looks like to them\n\nAnd if so you should be ashamed of yourself it's him important for those around you that are non believers to it for you when they are around you to give them the best idea you can of what you believe in white believe it\n\nTo give them that hope or maybe understanding in a way that they all want to ask questions or investigate on their own\n\nMost historians believe Halloween originated with the ancient Celtic festival\nOf selling its also pronounce saw van or champagne and it means the end of summer\nDuring this festival people would like these huge communal bonfires and yeah they were costumes mostly comprised of animal heads and for hours and they did this to ward off roaming spirits and goes that's kind of the basic element\nOf what Halloween was in one sense or another it's kind of the ...\n\nWhen the when the ... century finally rolled around pope Gregory this third designated November first as something called all saints day\nThis was a was a time to\nHonor saints and martyrs that had passed on\nYou can't look at that as a bad thing centrally honoring those in the Christian family that had done good and we're no longer on this earth\nWell is often is the case this particular this new holiday incorporated many of the traditions of the ... festival so a lot of the things\nThe kind of the ... that were already are being used to celebrate in sound when\n\nWe're now kind of attached to this all saints day you can kind of think of it this way it's much easier to paint an old building and put up a new sign in the news to to\nTear down the whole building and start from scratch right and this was nothing new and have been done many times before for instance many pagan customs were combined with Christianity wouldn't Constantine\nWent through the big conversion his was a slow conversion but when he latched onto it sometime around his forties\n\nHe converted the official pagan religion of the Roman empire to Christianity as it was between three twenty and three three eighty so little things came in and found their way home to Christianity that had a beginning in paganism\n\nSo back to a all saints day the evening before all saints day was a known is all Hallows eve\nAnd this is you can figure out later became Halloween\n\nTrees\nJust this data's Halloween has evolved and continues to evolve and can she needs to change and now it's moved into this as secular and randomly commercial\nI mean right behind Christmas commercial\nGo go out to a market or something today and you'll see just how commercial it is and it continues to get larger and larger each year and this Halloween becomes massive so over the centuries it continues to evolve it becomes secular\nIncredibly commercial and really it's the celebration that is embraced by communities many communities as more of a you know child centric holiday because of its activities like trick or treating or decorating your home to look spooky really\nFocuses on children and their desire to be creative or play make believe we're dress up for these types of things\n\nAnd I know that this becomes controversial because of its origin and there was a battle within the church as to what to do now first and foremost thing that should be thought of is safety always\nIf you're if you don't feel safe in your neighborhood or you don't feel safe certain things there's all kinds of alternative things to do your human community does other things that are are more controlled that's great even churches do\n\nBut just shy away from it because of its origins doesn't necessarily um [noise]\nA point to balance thinking in the church and it's not that your children should be running around I'm dressed as mayhem and the devil and all these things there there are middle grounds that you could do where you can partake in certain aspects of it\nAnd it can be enjoyed\nNot abused in any way because the truth of the matter is with healthy parent parental involvement Halloween can be fun\nAnd creative time for children\nI assure you and if you're worried about their involvement kids aren't parsing the\nMultifaceted theological underpinnings of the possibility of an antecedent pagan genesis I assure you\nThey just want to play dress up and get free sweets\nThat's it Mm\n\n\nYour yeah\nYarn Jesus Christ church will return in a moment to be a part

that surround you in this life you are in this world\nYou were in it by choice of God\nAnd there is a lot a lot of Christians who run from every thing because of origins and I'm going to show you why that might not be as easy as you think\nAnd every year I get calls in tweets and emails about Halloween and yes it is Halloween is rooted in paganism but that doesn't automatically mean that a Christian camp partake in it in some way or some fashion\n\nSo this Celtic festival of Sao in a later\nOr through a pope Gregory the third designated November first is all saints day\nSo it's all around the same time this is to honor a saints and martyrs but a lot of the traditions and ideas and certain other practices in from the ... festival made its way into that as well\nThe evening before\nOr this became known as a all Hallows eve that became Halloween now you've got this great commercial secular\nNon pagan religiously anyways event and\nIt's important to just realized that God's problem\nWith paganism or other belief systems is not necessarily their practices but that they do those practices while worshipping another got altogether exodus twenty first three you shall have no other guards performing\nLet's say if the lord that is God's word that's the concern\nWants you to celebrate in glorify him and every thing you do\nAnd\nAnd as to understand this little better just keep in mind two thousand years ago pagan sacrificed animals\nBut so did our Jewish brothers and sisters under God's command the same act with different intent was now a pleasing aroma to God as it says in genesis eight twenty and Twenty one and I'll read that the NOAA built an altered to the lord\nAnd taking some of the clean animals including birds he sacrificed burnt offerings on it the lord smelled the pleasing aroma and set in his heart never again like crushed the ground because humans even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from\nChildhood and never again will lie destroy all living creatures as I have done\nSo it's not just the act itself is being tempted is the purpose of that act that matters to God sacrifice to idols or a false God not good sacrifice to the one true holy\nAnd right just God good he pleasing aroma\nDiscarding something just because ... or any other faith did it at one time or does it\nNow really isn't isn't balance and it isn't thoughtful\nIt's the\nIt's like the the you know vegetarianism is bad because Hitler adhered to uh primarily vegetarian diet just seems like a weird way to go about life rather than seeing things for what they are and using them to glorify God\nOr its fallacious to think that because something had origins here\nOrange origins over here that it's good or bad really it's the application you probably don't even know how many things already in your life come from pagan origins\nGuess what you can look down at your a left hand there if you're wearing a wedding ring you're wearing something with ... in paganism in ancient magic\nAnd the concept of the circle as it is seen as this andel lesson timeless\n\nThing that you can wear and it suggests a kind of repetitive are unbroken time and space and you can see it in many pagan uses a such a Stonehenge\nAnd others that predate Christianity\nAnd even in Christianity itself there are symbols and practices that come from or were used by pagan the

going to be here I don't think at any level as Christians celebrate it okay why so\nWe'll just knowing the root of it and practices that went together those pagan rituals mhm it was really really anti Christian\nDo you ... do you ah refrain from celebrating anything do you celebrate any festivals at all you celebrate your birthday or anything like that\nUh yeah so that birthday\nOkay a lot of those have a pagan roots as well the celebration of life and fertility 'em all goes back are you married\nYet you were reading wedding ring yeah are you going to get rid of that belt\nOkay but that ... that has its background in both paganism a pre dating Christianity and also witchcraft\nSo\nAre you going to get rid of those symbols because of where they came or you going to uh bring them into your face and sanctify them set them apart from where they started just like you were sanctify\nBut by the blood products but gee a man\nI mean the the son who came back to his father the first thing all the ... yes\nBut the but but pre dating that very story yes that's that's my point that you have feasts that are Jewish and brother are brothers and sisters part took in around the same times as they were\nPagan fees and the Jews did not want to appear to be pagan elliptical laws as a matter of fact uh the majority of them or to a a separate themselves from the even the appearance of being pagan yet they did things that pagan did as well so it wasn't about the thing that they did it was about how they applied that\nRight and I understand\nI understand but the difference between what I'm Talking about the the ringer that situation is that Jesus or the latter yeah the thing to find out what Wayne\n... there are things that are being sent to fight every day by the use of a Christianity I mean do you celebrate Christmas or the or okay right yeah but that's not sink defied by God in any stretch any way shape or form and scripture there's never a celebration about that nor is there a celebration of Easter or those were the\nThat was ... ... ...\nNo that's not the day of his birth that's about two years later the purpose of all of this is that those things that you're talking about have become comfortable to you because they've been passed down do you not because of their origins\nThere is not a matter of fact the early church didn't celebrate it in that sense and those are in those land on pagan holidays and were\nYou served in both Easter and Christmas\nAnd a lot the ties into those things and the things that you celebrate really tightened up pagan beliefs the tree in the house the eggs and the bunny all of those things but it's what you do with him that matters not with from where they came from you came\nFrom a dark place in God's sake defied you and through the

this ... you'd be surprised how much\nIt is it has infiltrated not on its own but willingly by different groups or a leaders like Constantine in the like um that had\nShaved off as much of it as they could and then apply the others so that there was comfort level in its growth as a matter of fact Christianity can be argued by historians at least\nUm I might have a different talk but um that a lot of that is what propelled Christianity you know Rome\nConstantine changing Roman and their national religion and belief system at first it was opening it up to all beliefs and it was more ... okay listen you're not going to be persecuted for being Christian anymore that's the first day\nAnd then slowly\nOr he started opening that up and then he started saying well no paganism problem or going to start not just allowing everything but now putting paganism down and through the process the years and so on chained to a point where he says no Christianity is mandatory\nIn ways and then you've got people going okay\nWell then I'm just can take this with me or this with me or this with me does it always work absolutely not or their systems that how our polluted in perverted because they brought things into Christianity absolutely\nBut that's where discernment comes from and my purpose for bringing these things up and pointing them out is or even the word holy day I'm as been muted to holiday and their or things like blessings and the term holy itself that really ... very far back\nPre dating Christianity and the if you start just throwing the baby out with the bath water you have

these things from thousands of years of filtering\nHave become benign you\nKnow uh you know the the the practices that these things once held have nothing to do with it a child is not running around

it says in scripture that you were created in the image of God some argue that that is uh that you have intellect will and emotion others would say that you're very creativity of a desire to be creative or create and build any way shape or form is antithetical to the devil himself who wishes to destroy\nSo when you find children having a desire to create or be creative is something that should be encouraged\nOthers will look at Halloween and the concept of death and mayhem and say oh well it deals with the death or death or a skeletons and I've always appreciated the the the look of our brothers and sisters that have cultures rooted in a in Mexico\nAnd their uh their understanding or they're at peace\nWith the concept of death and they celebrate the day of the dead not it's something that worships the dead\nBut as something it's kind of like all saints day where it's a time to look back on the those from your family that have passed on and to celebrate their life\nBut it's done with him injuries are the imagery is goals and you know people get confused what is this about and it's it looks I'm dark and sinister and really it's not it's a it's about life\nThe place where I died ... is the place of the skull Christians are taught not just here she who can kill the flesh but he can kill the spirit or both\nAnd so that the the concept of combating a the fear of death is a scriptural one\n\nThough I Walk through the valley of the shadow of death I sure fear no evil\n\nAnd that kind of attitude is can be healthy and productive now as an adult and you need to have discernment in all things and apply it to your life in the life of your children absolutely\nAnd find where that line is for you and how you would want to practice or something like this but I Will tell you that when you\nWhen you kind of sequester a child from something that's going on in the world and it's not explained properly or just well that has demonic roots a kid doesn't even know what a pagan is or any of those things\nThen you end up cutting off a much more than you think you are because an environmentalist I'm yes on one side you can say I'm being a good Stuart with the world that God has given but on the other side\nEarly penguins\nWorshipping and taking care of the world\nSo is it about taking care of the world that's good or bad or is it about while you're taking care of the world and to who that Laura goes these are the things that I think our last in these battles of well it's just bad or it's just good God is just as good\nAnd there are a lot of Christian liberties and a lot of battling that went on and and the church of ... and ... should I eat this if it was the given the idols or a\nSacrifice to idle should do this and in many cases it's like eat what you want if a glorified God you're fine and then on some cases if there's somebody who's going to stumble by the very fact that you're doing that you don't want to cause the less reminded as scripture says are those that no less um to fall\nBut you also want to educate them in educating them then they won't stumble on the smaller stones\nThey'll see the bigger picture\nAnd that's my only hope here it's not to champion a particular holiday or to tear another holiday down it's to be reasonable\nA partially because if when you're reasonable others will see you're reasonable and they'll believe what you say about your faith and about God if they're non believers if you're unreasonable they will reject what you say and what you do in your belief in God [noise]\n[noise] Mm\n[noise]

callers there about the way in there Yes sir I wouldn't\nThink that anybody would really sick of it as evil but let's say warship it the way I look at it as fictional\nA fictional characters just like anything else it fun for the kids I mean unless you're warship them and people if they think they're evil the mask and whatever that with a\nGhost in golf is I don't believe which is good stuff like that anyway um I don't know\nShip them and put them before God it's just a holiday for the kids\nI think that as well said I think there's a lot of people that are see it for something that it's not or that it was once\nUm but it doesn't involve those things in truly it lands on the parents to make the decision in the life or their child a but they'd be careful you there are things you know we see on the program off and that their wounds you bandage and wounds you amputate so it doesn't pervert the rest of the body\nAnd there are some things you want to cut from your life possibly and say well I we don't want this we don't want that but there's also things that you can um re brand restructuring away um that are fun and healthy and I can have a good time and I speak to many many Christians\nAnd inevitably you ask them and they say well I just don't want to do on a child and well where you are brought up in a Christian household yes but my parents let us celebrate it and how long have you been worshipping the devil now\nIt it's it's not necessarily the way the path goes and you want to protect your children to the best of your ability but also keep in mind that if you're over sensitive on things that are benign or neutral or that you can um [noise]\nUh you can put an understanding of Christianity on it\nThen sometimes it confuses me causes great rebellion and that's not to say to be a lukewarm and wishy washy upbringing 'cause you don't want the kids rebel it's not my point\nPoint is that uh make sure that the things that you're trying to cut from their life that you make a good case for it and then it's understood across the board otherwise truly is they\nGet older and start doing their own research search and seeing that there's all kinds of things in your home that have a pagan origin and customs and things like that\nThen and then they'll start turning it back on you and of course that will be a problem\nCharlie welcome to the Jesus Christ show\nHi Charlie how can I help you [noise]\nI um I just had a question about I'm like how do I give 'em glory to God and the um like everyday simple things in life like going to a movie with friends or mowing the grass or anything like that you know\nWell there's it really comes down to if you if you're a child talk about their parents and you asked that child will you know would you give your life or your parents they\nSo yes but you asked that same child\nIf they'll mow the lawn or do the dishes and they'll go oh I don't want\nTo and Christians do this sometimes too it's like they ... you would lie lay down your life for your God if necessary but you won't live your life for God and that means every little boring thing\nYour parents don't want to be a you know you to be at their foot every ten seconds going gosh you're the greatest parents and the whole wide world ... they want you expressing that in the things that you do showing them that the life\nThey've given you will be a life that's productive\nAnd righteous and uh with filled with purpose and God wants the same thing yes God wants you to worshipping God once you in church God wants you to pray God wants you to do all those things that have become religious in nature but truly\nGod wants you to live a life I'm\nA vet is filled every single day we'd creativity with exploration with curiosity and um for instance it says in scripture to pray without ceasing and truly it's it's it doesn't mean nonstop like a ...\nUm it it means kind of like an incessant cough\nIt means always be in that state of knowing that God is there and that you're thinking about God and that's kind of what you do with everything and uh\nAnd if you partake in something Charlie where you feel like how can I bring got into this and it doesn't quite work then maybe that's something that you want to not do in your life yeah um yes I had a question\nAbout like what about like uh gone to the like scary movies like me it it doesn't affect me like I don't think it's bad but like ... ... not giving already God like if I were to go to the movie\nWell it's what the purpose is there are many scary parts to scripture and I know that movies to picked a
