I Divide the world into cheap fare and rich and I would say today that most assets are on the high side affair or into rich territory\nAnd I think that's where we are that now that said that things are highly prized\nIs very different from saying this kind of go down tomorrow you know\nThings have been highly price for a good period of time and they have to continue to rise I I'm not saying that people shouldn't be in the market\nI'm not saying there's going to be a downturn that starts tomorrow a merely saying that when you are in the elevated portion of the cycle as I Believe we are\nThat the odds are not so much in your favor or they're more against you and yet the outlook is not so bad and prices are not so high that this is the time to go to cash\nSo I don't treat we've had this mantra move forward but with caution and we still do we're investing every day you know we're trying to be fully invested bought with caution then we're cautious from with caution means even more cautious than usual so\nMost investors would benefit if they could think of the world the way I I Do which is to say that investors face every day two twin risks\nThe first is obvious it's the risk of losing money nobody wants to do that the second is more subtle it's the risk of missing opportunities you know and you if you say I don't want to lose any money then you have to forego all the opportunities if you say I don't want to miss any opportunities then you have to expose yourself to losing money\nJust are Jews won for balance the two yeah and\nMost people say well I don't want to lose a lot of money but on the other hand I don't want to miss all the opportunities and so they balance the two and that leads to the next question how how should you balance them for yourself given who you are and your financial situation and your age and your emotions in your independence and your needs\nWhat should be your normal\nManner of balancing the twin risks and then\nWhat about today\nShould your balance of the twin risks emphasize risk last avoidance\nOr opportunity maximus Asian\nToday more often or more defense and that's really the key question and I think that question has to be based on where the market is in that cycle and I think that that's the key skill that investors\nShould develop and that's what the book aims to do wonderful\n... new book mastering the markets cycle getting the odds on your son coming up you got a few socks on our radar cigarettes here this is my ...\n[laughter] there's always people on the program events sucks they talk about a month for me the formal recommendations for again nobody sauce based solely on when you hear welcome economical money ... here in Studio once again with the air and Bush ... or the singers\nEnron those guys are five hundred the episode was leave we've been doing it this law awesome it's amazing it's incredible Erin Bush I think was in middle school [laughter]\nI was I was like twelve years old in her though I was listening that's awesome [laughter] or is it an equal incidents that Tom Brady happen if there was five hundred TD pass last night I I don't know it seems so it's perfect I think it is a let's go to our men\nThe glass the broader he's going to do with the question or as we get the stocks on our radar and run a gross Europe first what are you looking at this week suggest a\nRadar stock for me it's a recent recommendation by fool analyst Mike Olson it's K.

have already so real I I like I\nHear everything they say and how they work and I'm just wondering is there any place in the Bible where I can go to get some guy tried to kill\nWell sure specifically no there's nothing specific about pi TST now I Would say what what is it that you're a physician or why do these things that you have this because this was because of an illness\nOh I yeah because I was like I Am\nA good lord only through [laughter] I Know for me I'm just waiting for him to tell me what that is [noise] I don't know I guess I feel I don't know why am I think that dreams and why it would be my she'll go\nWell dreams ah dreams play many parts in scripture and sometimes a dream is a dream and most\nOften people trains the dreams of liberal but the most common theory and and one of the best theory is if you imagined a mirror the big mirrors that uh was reflecting one of your bedrooms let's say in your home\nAnd you could see everything to you know let's say it's your bedroom it's got the clock on the table lamp that beautiful lamp you love so much you can see your bed the window and\nAh kids playing on the outside in the tree and the birds and all these things in the mirror and then if you went and you broke that mirror\nAnd the twisted pieces now would shift their perspective\nAnd now a there'd be a maybe you would just see the bird instead of the kids playing outside the window\nAnd now the lamp would be just above the bird so it would look as if the the lamp was on top of the bird's head and all these things are a distorted view of something that you already know or things that are in your life on a day to day basis or or in your heart or your head so I have a dream\nOften is is very disjointed and that's why when you wake up and you try to piece it together\nUm you're saying while I was in my house but it wasn't my house but I knew it was my house but it didn't look anything like my house and you start doing those things 'cause you're starting to try and reconstruct something that is torn apart that is all piecemeal and and it can be confusing\nSo I wouldn't take that that dream per se\nUm as liberal as much as it is that yes you had a traumatic experience and you thought probably a lot about death and what that would have been like\nAnd what being absent from the body or being absent from this world would be like it also made you think about those that you cared about to end or knew that had moved on before you and that comes together in a dream um that can be a little creepy\nAnd sad and those types of things so I don't know that you're going to pull direct meaning out of it but I Will see this throughout scriptural though it doesn't speak specifically\nTo pee TST and keep in mind PATS used to run around a lot there's very different forms and for different reasons um there's those that come back from combat in the military and that's a very specific and different kinds but there's those that that get it from watching someone they care about passing away or\nIn your case you going through something physically\nUm draining that was scary and potentially life threatening\nAnd you go through all those things and they cause you to wonder about your stability it's like\nYou live every day with the stability it's it's like if you could feel the urge to move how unsettling that would be um you don't think about it solid it's not it's moving all the time and there's things like that that you\nKind of ignore to get through life and when you're faced with them it can shake your foundation and make you quite nervous I Will say that there are scriptures that talk about comfort\nAnd talk about the process of comfort second Corinthians won three through five and it's a little interesting the way it's worded so I ask you to hear it and its fullness it says\nPraise be to God and filed and father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of compassion and the God of all comfort comforts us in our troubles so that we can come for those in any trouble with the comfort we're\nOr self receive from God for justice we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ so also our comfort of bounds through Christ now the word comfort\nYou so much there it gets kinda tied up in all of it but when you see it laid out it's talking about the compassion of the father and the the God of all comfort every comfort comes from God\nThe piece of life that you enjoy the things the stability in your life Debbie come from God\nSo it talks about God being the author of all of that comfort\nGoes on to say not only has got the author of comfort but God actively comfort you and your troubles why so that you also need comfort others in trouble with what with the comfort\nThat you received from God\nBut first five is interesting because it doesn't say if there's no ifs here there's no maybe it says for just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ\nNot if you have sufferings like rice or any of that it's for just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ so also our comfort of bounds through Christ\nAnd really focusing on God and letting God you're stability because the world is not stable\nThere are sharp corners to it there are scary things that happen they're scary people scary circumstances and they're ugly things are accidents ugly things that happen and if you focus on those things if you define yourself by that moment\nIf you define yourself by the things that have happened to you\nThen yes that will build up\nInside you and that will become your focus if you focus on God the unchanging creator of all creation and the author and distributor of comfort and you use what comfort you received the comfort of others to the best of your ability\nThat's what you are called to do right now that's what God wants you to do\nIt just about every day I woke up out of um like apart and it\nWill be such a joy when I get that if one I bite my stopped falling back\nWhen I start off again\nAt a girl that's exactly right so is there a way for you to donate your time or to spend time with others that might be in pain or going there's times\nThat I've um I've been down to her and I walked to the park down on Skid Row their ... and I've never been able to talk about God or anything like that on my life on a couple of years ago and\nAnd things happen and if you bank on the world always being okay\nAnd if you expected there's never going to be any problems you're going to be surprised and your world will get rocked but if you trust in God that does not move that is always the same that is where the true stability in life comes from\n\n\nI'm\nNot a mom and my mom\nDied when\nSure will return in a moment\nOf a show called the holy [noise]\n\nEat\nMocks News I'm

I see them happy successful I I Try to read Bible verses which is really really hard for me\nTo to have faith and let everything go and I'm just so\nI'm so nervous and I'm so scared like I just bought a burden on me I Want to believe but it's truly are well\nFirst of all I Do want to point out that not every Christian is happy and certainly not every Christian and successful but I Know what you're saying that you see that that that it does work for some people and working quotes and that there's there might be something to it but what do you what do you think is keeping what are you afraid of\nUm\nI don't know I I don't know I don't know what it is I don't know if it's fresh and I'm just I guess that a lot of pain that happened in my life where\n... I Want to know why why did it happen I don't want to blame or something or playing got ... I like to think that maybe it happen for a reason but it it just after time after time again when something bad and I don't know why it happened I Want to know and I want to believe\nMaybe maybe it's happening for a reason\nI ask you you know that people that you asked a question that people have to go to church ask them you know why why what God or how\nHow how to get out of out of it where it how do you how do you believe in it so so faithfully how do you believe that he can you trust [noise] well\nIt's interesting that you talk about bad things happening and you also talked about good things happening there's people that have good things happen to them and you point out the bad things happen\nWhat's a what's a bad thing how could you describe what a good thing was or a bad thing was if there wasn't some rulers some judge something above it all\nThat gives you that understanding in your heart and your head as to what's good and bad\n\nThere is no God good and bad doesn't mean anything is a society that decides well that's good or that's bad because there's different societies that believe different things there's can of ballistic societies you wouldn't think it was good to eat people\nSo why why do you think things are are good and bad and then question the the concept of God\nI guess um [noise]\nWell I guess what I feel in my heart out I guess that's where I'd been hot ... well just what I Know I've never really been the church and I haven't really uh you know steady the I edited vibe on my own ... versus lost\nAbout ... about the learning part 'cause there's a lot of people in this world that so they use the Bible to\nTo be bigoted I'm sure and not love and hate and that stuff like that I chose\nMe away from it one of the people are like just turns me away\nSo I was just confused I don't I don't know and I want this I Want this bird in this hole in my heart to stop I Want\nI Want to be okay and I'm looking for it but no one's ever really out of the answers and I didn't do it on my own so\nWell what are your questions\nHow do I believe how do I go to eat it like throughout the wait for AmeriCorps to ask you just keep studying to just fake it till I make it [noise] I don't know\nBut you have every day out every day you experienced things you use face every day", "show_name": "Jesus Christ Show (PRN)", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "08"}
