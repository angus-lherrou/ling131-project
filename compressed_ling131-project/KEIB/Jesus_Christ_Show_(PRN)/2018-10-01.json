progress help inspire\nAll these things in life that's what being human is but if you don't practice that daily if you don't find ways\nDaily\nTo participate in life to help someone to care for someone to share in sight\nThere's no guarantee you'll be able to do it tomorrow if you get in a mindset and always says well ah you know what I can do that tomorrow\nYou may never get the opportunity\nAnd that's what really births regret regret is truly not getting done today what should be done today\n\nStepping out of those comfort zone stepping out of a your the schedule that you've built that is really just\nA schedule of protection for laziness oftentimes there are those your schedule their day so that they can get as much done as they possibly can and there are those that go forth and schedule their day to kind of protect their downtime\nAnd everyone needs downtime but if that becomes the predominant part of your day\n\nYou're missing out on a huge portion of who you are and what I was assigned you for\nThem\nTo interact with one another and to inspire\nAnd scripture as quick to point out that you don't know how long you're going to be here there's this assumption that are there is a guarantee on a certain amount of years\n\nAnd there's just not\nThere for those things that often are uncomfortable telling someone you love them and how many times have you been to a funeral\n\nUsually when someone dies young and inevitably someone will stand up and go you know what I tell people you care about that you love them do it today because I never told\nSo and so I never really let them know how I felt\n\nThe reason why that's echoed all the time is because people hear it and don't do it and without the application of that it's for not in means nothing\nWhat James is reminding you hear in chapter ... for for ... fourteen is that life will go by quickly that you don't know how long you're going to be here for\nBecause you don't even know what will happen tomorrow you have no idea to so to set your to set your sights only on tomorrow makes you missed a day\n\nIn a very clever way it's been said that today\nIs a gift from God the future you don't know what's gonna happen in the past started taking place but today is a gift from God which is why it's called the present little corny maybe\nBut an easy way to remember that the now is what's important how you apply that that's what's important\nAnd James doesn't want you to forget that\nYou go on diverse Seventeen says therefore to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it to him it is a sin how interesting that it goes from letting you know\nThat time goes by quickly that there is no guarantee\nMoving on from fourteen all the way down diverse Seventeen than it reminds you that if you know the right thing to do and you don't do it it's a sin\n\nThat if you have opportunity\nIf you know what needs to be said or needs to be done and you don't do it it's a sin and I know that the hearing that word saying just sounds religious and the it doesn't pertain to me or what have you with us in just means missing the mark\nAnd when you miss your mark you miss the will of God\nThere's so much that needs to be done there's so much that you want to do\nBut I simply encourage you to do it today don't\nWait\nPut it off and hope that you'll get the opportunity\nBecause you never know\n\nWhen this message to you today is not a message of\nSadness or guilt or any of those things\n\nIt so that you appreciate the now\n\nThat you apply in a way that you're productive it's for you it's not just for me to to get you in a headlock and just say hey\nDo this it's that it's the way you are designed\nNo time limit on your physical your outer shell\nThey talked about in scripture your body the time limit is with great purpose you get in your experience this life\nYou learn the tools to understanding goodness and godly this through example through trials\nAnd then one day when the father says you go home\nFor the time you are here is to be spent your productivity and I encourage you not to waste a moment of it\n\nSpend the time with your family with your friends\nDo that

show in the work that you do think you um Jesus\nI er overcame a when I accepted are you into my heart I overcame an addiction that was terrifying to me uh in the twinkling of an eye and I'm so grateful for that\nIt's been three and a half months now and I don't even think about it anymore but now it's the new year and I'd like to overcome another addiction in that cigarette smoking and I am more afraid of it\nOvercoming this one then I was a overcoming the other addiction I was wondering if you had any advice for me\nWell the addictions are going to be similar as far as the emotional aspects um the physical acts aspects can be different depending on how they interact with your body\nSo that the needs may be very different um the fact that you're just getting over one addiction in three months I'm\nI'm all for you clipping these things out of your life as they are anchors are weights and keeping you from doing things that you want to do um but that seems like a very quick transition\nTo go from one and then jump into an ... or another so I'm I'm hopeful that you kind of looked waited everything and said okay this is the time so that it doesn't become so burdensome that you throw up your hands and go okay see I couldn't do it now now they're both back\nBut I've seen so much evidence in my life over the last six months and particularly the last three and a half months that I'm just you know by a concerted effort on my part I can I can handle it but\nI just want this but cigarette smoking bothers me because\nYou know it seems like such a temptation to pick it up again and and you know I have already lost so far [laughter] [noise]\nWell they there's a and I'm not saying that you can't do it\nI Believe you can what I don't want you to get to as a place of discouragement 'cause it's it's you know there's so many um outside elements as it is and the enemy loves to sit there and tell you how much you can't do\nAnd uh so going and moving forward and going into it I Want you to look at it realistically and say okay well this is what I Want to do I want to um yeah if you want to cut it off completely that's a pretty difficult thing to do\nAnd sometimes too slowly weeded out of your life because you've got a lot going on uh with that type of addiction when you're talking about smoking um you have a physical\nAddiction and a chemical addiction that's attached to the physical habitual addiction so you sit there and this is not a show about uh you know medical procedures or medicine in any way shape or form but\nUh even spiritually and your life you'll see how if you make something a habit\nThat habit becomes difficult to break\nCreating a new habit now is just going to ... be a level consistent it's a matter of one breaking that that physical desire and that's something that you may want to talk to your physician about\nAnd then the the habit that the actual physical habit of picking something up and putting in your mouth or taking the time a out of the work day or whatever you might be doing to to go outside to smoke becomes part of your habit\nSo depending on how you used it a ... and how many cigarettes would you say you smoke\nA about a pack and a half day okay that's quite a bit of cigarettes yeah it is so that's a lot of your\nDay that is separated by by those little cigarettes like they they come they they're um a visitor of sorts that you're used to\nAnd that that absence a lotta people um the sounds strange but will feel loneliness when they're not smoking because it's almost like they have a visitor\nThat comes every so often once an hour once every couple of hours whatever it might be yeah so really it you're tackling it and in parts and you're going to have to find something to um accommodate that physical need to hold something or um\nAnd a lot of ... that's why a lot of people get heavy when they're not smoking because they start eating and that kind of ... that first part\nUm but it's a matter of of doing the exact same thing you did with the other addiction that is applying it to your life just doing it\nYeah and the other one Jesus\nOr with the other addiction I literally just put it down and uh I've never picked it up again and it's just gone from my art now\nI hear stories like that every day and a lot of people say it's not possible honor code but it can be done and I ... as we talked about earlier I'm being with you always and if you put me first and seek the things have God I'm going to be with you throughout the entirety it's not just on\nYou um but\nThen I'll lean on you when I Need a cigarette how 'bout that\nThat's always a good thing to do it's just a matter of understanding the process and knowing that every moment you stop or every moment you're not doing any of this moment closer to your body accepting that new habit you created this happen it's not it's not like you went to a pack and a half a day immediately\nYou you would have a ... often hacked and vomited\nIt was a process that you talk to your body to accept and to consume and do enjoy and now you're going to have to rethink this and this goes for all kinds of things and people get caught up in in addictions saying oh well how can I Do this but you train into your body\nInto accepting these things that are foreign how much how much more difficult to think that is have you ever tried to feed a child something that they don't want to eat you ... your training your body to accept something that we're pulses it\n\n[noise] [noise]\nThe time\n\nA dollar

you can follow us on Twitter at Jesus' show\n\nBrenda welcome to the Jesus Christ show some hybrid now [noise] I read like five o'clock alarm not\nSure the deck a log a that is the big fancy word for the ten commandments um now the ten commandments or are they can be found in a couple of places in scripture but primarily when people a reference or quote and they're looking at exodus twenty versus two through Seventeen so that's what we'll look at a today\nUm is there a particular reason you want to hear the ten commandments\nGr well\nAre you you just want to hear them [noise]\nOkay um well they're broken down differently depending on the group uh uh the Jewish breakdown of the ten\nOr the Anglican uh orthodox Catholic Lutheran they tend to break them off differently so I'm just going to go down them for you is that you can hear them I'm usually have a new or the gods before me\nAh you shall not to uh make for yourself an idle you shall not make one full use of the name of your God I'm don't take a God's name in vain remember the Sabbath and keep\nIt wholly honor your father and mother you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witnessing into your neighbor you\nShall not covet your neighbors wife you shall not cover covet anything that belongs to your neighbor so depending on on\nHow you break them up some people will combine some of those or separate other parts of them and make them into the tens sometimes you you might read a if you read the ten commandments and a Catholic Bible it would be a different from other Christian bibles\nI'm so those types of things can get a mixed up but really it's not about\nThe labeling them as ten because that's not how it's a\nIt's not how it comes out I Know a lot of ... you get caught up in scripture now when you see the chapters in versus and you say oh well they labeled it differently but really there there was no chapter and verse\nNot in that context not in the same way in the same sense it was more about getting the entirety of scripture out and the purpose of scripture so the truth is regardless of how you label them one through ten or\nIf you don't label them one through ten that the importance lies and not having any other God's before God or not having any idols\nUm honoring your father or mother not murdering not committing adultery these things are what's important\n\nBenjamin welcome to the Jesus Christ show yes I'm a high Jesus thanks for taking my call my pleasure\nUm I I had a question in regards to ah wearing a\nCross mhm oh I Am a member my church who who love the way the cross I mean where's the cross with the the image of yourself okay on across a nail to across in the whole\nWhole thing and I and I told him I said I said do you feel comfortable I honestly I'm aware lacrosse he said well yeah this is a Christian image I said well think of it like this said your relatives murdered by a group of those like the woman\nAnd it got murdered you know pretty much for preaching the gospel which which which is a great in crime outside of the woman law now would you feel comfortable putting your relative that was murder on the cross\nAnd eat and he got silent he moved to LA but if you look like one of the\nWell it's a it's an ugly image the the image or there were two thieves that died on either side of me that day and on by the very same method and there were many thousands and thousands of people who were uh killed by way of execution by way of\nCrucifixion so it takes place what ... what I'd like you to see is that the expression of faith in that and the reason why something that so horrific becomes a appointed glory demanding\nAnd ah you know a lot of our Catholic brothers and sisters work crews fixes and there's a lot of a of our past and brothers and sisters that prefer not to that that don't they if they were across the blink crossed it's not a crucifix with the actual\nAh Corpus Christi the body of Christ on it so\nUh it's personal taste but really the the belief is is things some people say the empty cross is where is is where the glory is ultimately if you want to wear something that shows the glory would be the empty to not cross it all but the process the bloodshed on the cross and the death on that cross\nIs what brought that glory that you've experienced today via salvation and if somebody wants to\nWear a cross with uh the crucifixion on it I'm so be\n\nJesus Christ and show will return in a moment to be a part of a show called the seven seven radios [noise]\nYour own\nPerson

tough time to go back into real estate I'm\n... now as far as being a contractor and you called and you'd be read oblique brave and honest and uh I appreciate that mark and I know that it's it's hard for you and uh men tend to tie a lot of value in worse\nOff a into their job and how they're providing for their family and I realize you're being hit on many different levels of physically the stress of it emotionally\nUm that though those battles that you go on with yourself about oh gosh I'm On western but man to them not providing any of these things then and that's of the devil by the way I'm were\nCredible right now sure ... and all those things are going to beat on a you know you come at you from different sides in addition to um you know really\nThe the the finances um being a falling out from underneath you but\nYou you build that for nothing yeah okay so you've been at nothing before this is probably the first time with a wife and kids\nTo be in a situation where you're going oh my goodness I'm In a lot of times when people get to that that does that dire place of having to make such a a decision\nAs bankruptcy and I know that there's Christians to go back and forth whether it's a Christian option some people argue or you know bankruptcy is a legal option not a moral option all of these things was pushed that aside to look at um what what's going on in your life and uh the fact that you own it\nUm to look around at ... the best thing is you you there's only so much more you can lose a and also how you're going to rebuild this and what you're going to do different way\nBecause that's where you're at you're at a rebuilding stage on it you can't really salvage you continue to hemorrhaging and all these things money and you're you're saying you can't pull a paycheck\nUm this is the time to look at what you do for a living and whether you want to do something else or whether you're just going to do a whole me over and jump into any job in ...\nFast food that anything um to be in the workplace again and I'm also a what method you you used that didn't work as far as putting money aside\nUm I ... we have many different friends\nOf the Jesus Christ show and they have are from many different walks of life and I talk to them all about things they do or whether it's saving money or I'm investing or whatever they they do and why they do it and we have a friend of the shows that are\nAre are that are actors and that's not a very sturdy\nA line of work uh and uh you know some athletes and these types where you look gosh that's a very temporal that's very limited as to how long you're going to be able to work and I fear that sometimes\nAlthough the mindset of those types of jobs is hey we have to save now we have to work as much we can we have to do what we can now because it's not always going to be there whereas somebody you're more traditional jobs tend to think oh well the work's always going to be there or the money's the incomes always going to be there and that's not necessarily the case either\nDid you build a plan did you have a savings account did you have things that uh uh um as far as a safety net\nI'm no I'll Wait for a new region where it was coming with construction\nAnd prominent we bought up they could not afford 'em you know when I bought grade teacher [noise] you know create was first starting a bankruptcy and I did not have a plan her future like that um [noise]\nYou know I'd go well let's get asked that was started I didn't know where I Am\nWell buying a house is a strange thing as you'll find a lot of people say listen you won that stretch your your comfort zone and buying a home but um as we've seen the evidence of in the past um that a lot of people did that when they couldn't they stretch themselves to be on a normal limit and went to a limit that\nNot practical you point that out yourself and that's a that's a healthy statement for you to make say hey this is where I think we went wrong\nSo now you have a better outline of how to do it right this time and then that's kind of where your mindset has to be you have to switch from the mindset of gosh I Need to make money as a a masonry\nAnd uh and\nAnd say okay it's amazing I'm not bringing in this this money now I Need to look and find out any kind of work I can do anything you're you're looking at getting work I've even talked to people on the on the program that um are out of work and I tell them to do voluntary work because you shouldn't be\nYou shouldn't be stagnant you need to be up and around and you need to be interacting with people and you need to be meeting them and they need to be meeting you and you need to be using skills and uh you need to find ways to do that now otherwise you're going to continue to weather as far as being a punishment it's not a punishment it's a consequence\nIt's a consequence to the things that you did there was some things that you did that weren't very smart\nYou you said okay we're going to put him going to put us in the house that that's a a overextending us\nAnd um you're not going to save and you put yourself in a situation where if there was a problem it took ... is that you can't a staff the the firehouse as if there is never going to be a fire and that's that's the problem but the best thing I hear mark\nIs that you are in charge of this you and your wife are partners\nAnd the the you are already make note of the things that you did wrong so it's a matter of jumping back in just differently you're if people try and jump back in where they where they stopped and that's not what you're doing you have to jump back in at the beginning and you've got to kind of start over again\nBut better it's like the old saying oh going back I wishing you a now what I ... wish I knew then what I Know now well now you do to start over clean but started were smart\n[noise]\nAnd um\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nJesus Christ church will return in a

Begg knows his or agnostics means without knowledge that's that means that they were they don't necessarily believe in God or don't believe in God they're not sure that's not really a sect that's that's just a a it's a world view\nUm but the uh the scenes there there's a difference in the this is why a lot of these books and unfortunate Dan Brown and and a and a lot of keep in mind they're they're fiction and a lot of that the stuff that's taught in them is\nIs not historic and I I Know a lot of people think that it is and they get confused because there's a little bit of history here a little bit of history there and they're using you know actual street names and actual museums and all these things and ah and then they kind of compiled them but it's for entertainment\nPurposes and unfortunately people start to consume those things are they here certain words or certain names being thrown around and they feel they have an understanding but uh as we stay on the show over and over time there's a major difference between good sound reasoning and reasons that sound good\nAnd so people get those two confused I'm not sure what you're asking\nWell my question is basically okay the gods were according to a saint Thomas saint Philip\nIn case those were apocryphal though\nThat that's a whole different word apocryphal means a hidden or in this case these were works that did not cut the mustard as far as a candidate position meaning that there was something wrong either with the way they were written or with the author ship\nOr the the timeline or something wrong with them that\nPointed to them most likely not being scripture doesn't mean that they're bad they're bad or or writings or ... you know they ... they wouldn't be of interest to read um however they don't fit\nWith scripture meaning there was some problem with them the same way you look at any work of antiquity this isn't just the Bible but you look any work of antiquity if you were to make claim that this was written by so and so or it was written about such and such that they have to kind of drive with other big league rascal tests\nTo make them a considered part of a a ... or\nA you know a Herman outta work it's like well this all works and it all has the same thing in a minute and authorship can be pointed to there's things that\nThat uh would\nCast it out from a group and a lot of people assume that those things are mysterious or that the church did it because it said something about reincarnation or the church did it because it said something about women or men or whatever and really that's just not the case\nAnd then and then uh who who actually made that's termination well the actual Catholic Church\nWell no it's it's the ... it was a groups of bishops there's not really it's not as formal as people think that it is really it's a matter of um\nIt's it's more like it's more organic than that and a lot of people think oh well gosh the big league rascal tests yes they hold up on on their own but as far as the ... and yes we're there councils\nAbsolutely there there's many councils you've got the council nice the of the council of Trent council of Cal Saddam all these councils had a purpose to refine or to agree upon one thing but it was more a more like a group um\nI don't know a team of any kind of coming together and saying I'm this is the way we've been doing it for all these years is everybody in agreement that this is the way we're gonna continue to do it and everybody goes yes and then they move on it's not a ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jesus Christ Show (PRN)", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "01"}
