Catalina cruiser and our city of light in the dirt mile\nAnd a certainly enable I mean I I think almost half the single label and if you want to take a shot at some of the pictures and picked forest or the other room looking at it the sprint and uh I really think depending on where mind your biscuit plans you can probably narrow that went down to\nUm I think Roy H A is by far the fastest growing the west coast and imperial hand has been dominated on the east so I'll be working with narrow down to that one and the sprint depending on where my ... yeah\nOkay now I mean ... had just been tremendous he was he was great last year in rent huge and Breeders' Cup and he's been really solid this year um and uh yeah he's going to be very tough X Y jet I'm not sure he's going to run\nA he needs to show something in workout if he does he's awfully fast too and that changes that race a little bit so promises filled also going to be in there so you know you got to show up when a Breeders' Cup you gotta you gotta be bring your a game and the ... has been doing that so pretty tough so\nNice weekend to you last weekend couple wins a Saturday three when three try sectors in the early pick for on Sunday or a hundred and forty five and a four winds at Belmont so pretty nice uh last weekend the score yesterday so let's jump in the day in and make it happen\nLet's look at Belmont will look at one of the two feet races you're looking at race now and the empire just tap handicap\nAnd the favorites on the bottom that summer twelve Bonita Bianca and I believe the uncles favorite because a fine record over the over the over the track of three for two or three and two for three of the distance that were just buried outside on the twelve pose a last time at a church tribe's kind of non scripted mistakes\nAnd many Franco seen enough Manny advantage for another horse who I don't like that much and that was a nose apart from another wars in the field that I don't like either so we're going to definitely try to be ...\nAnd uh the skill of the card in my opinion is the worst I like it a number six frosty and generous nine to to process the ends reeled off six straight wins\nAnd up is a very very nice for for six or over the track here\nA junior Alvarado stays on board and a trained as a PR Rudy Rodriguez who uh is very very good and these are state bread steaks and hits hard uh this is a a price to almost too good to be true and I don't think they're going to get the Ninety two but hey if I get three to one I'll take it our number six in the empire just I've had a cap\nOkay again this they're going a mile and the sixteenth on the dirt here that is one turn at Belmont and frosty and could not be coming in and better form\nOr like you said winner of six in a row will spotted by Rudy Rodriguez and obviously they had this race in mine hasn't run since mid August so nice little break come back trying to make some big money here six frosty and in race nine straight wind better we playing around a little\nThree underneath and the trifecta and we're not going to use the favorite because we'll have an all wagon if the favorite hits the board there will be covered and they all like hope for the favorably off the board well he was number one ... who had a terrible race last time just kinda we kicked it away after a while the polling behind early\nAnd I'll I'll always give them one race like that because you know things can happen they can get sick and you know there's a very good chance of ... will cover and a bounce back from a at eight to ... we used ... now smile coming off a nice spring well who are tend to one\nAnd then when I was only a half away behind for us to add a couple of back\nIs also gender is eight to one so uh I think that favorite is a beautiful and hopefully will beat them completely and knock him off the ticket out of two hundred fifty cent trifecta a\nSix frosty on with the three I mentioned six would want to eat a level of all six with all would want to eleven a one eight eleven with sticks with all and the little saber won eight eleven with one eight eleven with number six cross the editor nice wouldn't bet on ...\nOkay and again that's race nine and a very nice card they know you're you're looking forward to plan today at Belmont Park like in those whole field says we'll\nYeah for sure I mean you get your price that's that's great and just a quick mentioned John gods and just did it again and ask that cracks men\nWho was the big horse last year a and is kind of the opposite a number of enable um he's the cold and he just won the champion stakes by bought five or six lengths which he did not see very often over in Europe he just destroyed that field so he's back they put blinders on today and um\nMaybe maybe they run him back here but I don't know that they're causing wants to run him against enabling the Breeders' Cup turf but they are different owners so we'll see but he could not have run better today are so craftsman is back for a for God's than in the big race over there All right let's go to Santa Anita and uh and and now something today\nRace ate a it's a optional Kramer slash allowing conditions race a sixteen thousand dollar optional claim or for some of these that for all of them the favorite or on the ... is on the real number one Ninety nine proof\nThat we were Ninety nine proof last time which was a time to be on um\nA one way or the score tonight for a while when ticket for us\nAnd uh this time oh he's on the rail and you'll notice is avoided claim last time a joke you know sometimes I felt that serious sometimes it'll be more serious but bill combined with Israel I think we got a Ninety nine proof for the right time not looking for that lightning to strike twice on a bottle and the horse I like here there's a number for fire to the wire\nOr Andrew learners are very uh uh underrated trader that's really coming along a he's a nice to for five at the made so far he's thirty percent wins or when he's had a last right whether he claimed\nOr be fired or sixteen thousand dollar climber that are that run to back earned him a hundred or risk bigger speed figure filly triple digits vigorously in the field\nEither fire the lawyer a drawn Welna for post a isn't the right spot or to take on a the a real horse Ninety nine proof\nAnd we'll use to other horses will play this of the trek factory is Jason and will use a number six K Abner who has a right behind a nine to improve that will use the bottom for some very tough but lives but underneath only says he finished mine both of those\nThose are the three in the trifecta and as I Know we're short on time but we'll play it like a so we'll play a video or solve your thyroid ... will play for one fixate with all will twelve for with all at once excited and then we'll just he was the one six on top one six\nOne four six eight with all we won't ... on the winter and\nOkay and again the key here and we're talking about race uh eight at Santa Anita the key the for fire to the wire dragging Van Dyke for Andrew learner good young up and coming trainer people need to take notice of doing a very nice job and like you said just claimed the source of interesting to see how that plays out for\nWith the one six eight in race ate at Santa Anita Jake nice weekend last weekend do it again this

talk about the federal deficit has been in the news but then to figure out how and why it's affecting you and your interest [noise]\nBuses and you'll spend now obviously debt and deficit together if you're in huge amounts of debt\nAnd you have a deficit how are you going to clear your debt so they tied together but they're certainly different now a lot of talk about the deficit this week because of the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell at brought it up and he pinned the rising budget on the ... federal spending programs\nAnd he said very clearly this isn't a policy issue this is a bipartisan issue this is something we all need to look at ...\nAnd this problem is obviously very disturbing we're we're spending more than we're taking\nAn at the bottom line is exactly right and funnily enough Mitch McConnell described it in exactly the same way very ... maybe I should run for Senate I think that's a good idea you know my vote okay thank you\nHow does this affect investment opportunities\nLooking it has a ... I mean this is a nation US government if the U.S government has a huge amount of debt they don't have the money to pay it\nCreates can son in the ... the markets and then you have that ripple effect on deficit right now are\nFor the for the fiscal year ending September the ... was seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars on spending has been growing aggressively waltz tax revenue stayed flat it's it's a big problem\nSo where do you think our deficit is heading in the wrong direction we so we sort of Seventeen percent deficit increase from from the one year period prior to that so the trend is out and all the deficit is projected to be over trillion dollars within the next couple of years\nOn my how does how is that going to affect individual Americans I it's pretty\nSimple really I mean more debt and higher deficits dip into the pocket of the individual seat debt and deficit tends to drive up interest rates as we've been seeing which leads to slow economic growth\nSlow economic growth in ... in turn leads to to lower wages which leads to an overall lower standard of living blouse you look at all call house you wishing payments everything starts to become more expensive\nI mean even in the grocery store you we've already seen you know pricing going\nThat's inflation mount and it's happening every single day and a funnily enough when the government calculate inflation today they tend to ignore things like food and energy and key metric so I think the real inflation rate is probably a little bit higher than the government said\nOr maybe even more than a little bit it seems that way I'm trying to be noisier gotcha\nWhat about investment opportunity is that slowed down also is the deficit goes up or or are there more opportunities such as precious metals their\nOwn way so that you no matter what the market is right there are times when there are ... and the stock market and there are times when there are huge opportunities elsewhere I think one

have been raising rates to aggressively and essentially stated that that was the reason we saw such a big drop in the markets um\nSo you know he's blaming the fed ultimately for last week's drop in the markets and he's been condemned from uh for that and quite frankly I see both sides to that argument so I understand where he's coming from but obviously I understand the Federal Reserve has a job to do as well so the balance like\nWell the raising the interest rates is too is is to keep inflation down right that's one mhm what other reasons are therefore raising that interest\nLook at the end of the day we have to have interest rates at a at a decent level we use a drop in interest rates as a tool to pull ourselves out of trouble right well the economy appears at least on the stuff is to be taking alone when else do you raise rates now Trump once rates low\nBecause he's really pushing the idea of a healthy economy on his presidency so the last thing he wants to see is a stock market crash before his second term or who then the next election ultimately\nUm but at the same time one of the Federal Reserve can do they need tools available to them a typically when we have a major correction the fed would drop rights as much as five percent to try and stimulate\nRates right merit to an ... we don't even have those tools available at some point they have to start raising to give us back the tools we need\nAnd those tools are used to keep the economy\nGoing yeah it's it's what we did in LA right everything's sort of grinds to a whole real estate's crumbling stocks are
