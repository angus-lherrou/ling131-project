{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "Doing it for third graph has only they can\nUm and I'm looking forward to a a big Breeders' Cup boy they've had some all it takes is one or two big scores and they're going to be taken swings to make that happen\nAll right we're going to take our ah our final break I got Jay free land or cheat up next he's ready to roll he's got some Breeders' Cup friday thoughts for you as well and of course he's got a place from Santa needed today and I believe in the final race a stick around you listen to inside racing on Saturday were here every seven ... seven to eight we'll be right there\n[noise]\nHis brain Jay on and make it happen right now let's go to go to [noise]\nAlmost\nMourning mourning Jason how are you I'm doing well other than the\nDisappointment of a thing that Belmont card washed out I had a play I\nLiked that that that's how it always works that's the frustrating part you put the work and you put the time and you find some things you get excited and then they\nYeah that's a I Know the ceiling and hurts but hey they did the right thing um you know safety is first but uh\nWell I Know you've got the other place before we go today let's let's talk a little Breeders' Cup and maybe Breeders' Cup friday since we're not going to have an opportunity to do that all all send an email out to everybody with some thoughts but a Breeders' Cup friday we Roger didn't just gave us very information good information on that first raised the Turks sprint I looked up soldiers call\nA trained by Archie Watson ran a bunch of times this year and got down to a very good number or against The Elders there so that's kind of interesting um well she got that right I\nKnow that that is a terrific angle by Roger and soldiers call was one of two or three I was looking at that race anyway and then to notice the ... race came against the older you know soldiers calls probably on the top of my list on that one let's look at the Breeders' Cup a juvenile turf which is the fourth race or on the Breeders' Cup card there\nAnd I think they know Brian as he often does has the top contenders in here\nAnd I think be a top contender of all of them is a uh the one that are listed as opposed to this is one way or the dry up their listed alphabetically\nAnd that's a Anthony Van Dyke ... and I ran a third and the ... do ... which is a six hundred thousand dollar raise and I know this is a million dollar race and it's you know promoted as the world championships\nAnd really for dirt races it is the world championships for for ... races you know you look at her is like the early do urged I'm Sorry but that dwarfs or you know the Breeders' Cup juvenile turf even though the person is much bigger on the juvenile turf rhetoric credible third in that race\nAnd then second before that it had been snow Brian ... so I I Do think is a deserving favored here and do they haven't set of mourning wine yet probably will be reflected in the favorite here but we'll\nSee you know maybe we have a chance to beat him will kind of key on him but the other horses I liken the race or the other you know Brian broom\nAnd it was kind of interesting is uh Ryan more is the first call a writer Britain O'Brian the second call writer if his son a donut shop and they've kind of alternate it uh you know mountains on those two are they both are the last two each of them have have written blow them they'd been bike and room\nAnd room just run a very nice struck in a in a very very good race in France it's a great one group one uh the the guitar present a little longer there so uh yeah broom would certainly be a top candidate to be very curious to see where I Am more of your wind up\nYeah I think that's kind of the key there I mean Donald Kobe Bryant is really good up and coming writer But Ryan more as the man so you know the horse he chooses I Believe he's choosing it and uh that I think you've got to give a big boost to whichever one\nOr Ryan more rides don't throw the other one out but uh you know depending on the draw a yeah he's he's held a very strong hand in most or for good reason a little more than eight and a writer absolutely loaded every year this is what they do and they do it better than anybody so\nYeah absolutely I I think are just on paper flag in the in the Van Dyke will be Ryan's choice we're going to find out the the other two horses that I think you need to look at the race our memories diamond\nWho is a a a group three winner and has also run alone group twos\nAnd the interesting horse to me that's going to be a price and that's a line of duty from Charlie Applebee for a good dolphins with William Buick aboard the actions that one and the Breeders' Cup last year they won in the Philly America here if I Believe that was will hater\nWho uh I gave out on my uh full Carter was a twenty four dollar winter up these guys are underrated all the time never get that they don't get no respect Jason and uh I Do think a line of duty is going to be a serious factor in here\nSo I Would key on Anthony Van Dyke and use the others rate uh put everything in the end of the first spot and then put the other three underneath and go all and then flip it around put those other three on top of Anthony Van Dyke\nAnd then go all in third spot as well and then I\nWent in place that line of duty with more to board a place where they'd be like a five dollar ten dollar ratio because line of duty will probably be Fifteen to what I mean yeah\nThat sounds about right something like that and he's got a shot in there for sure um yeah he's a very interesting or something like you said those could dolphin connections for some reason seem to fly a little bit under the radar these days and a boy they know what they're doing to and Charlie Applebee's very good with the young horses for good often really has kind of turn that around for them the last few years so\nThat's something for people to take note of and of course you're going to have your phone card both days friday and Saturday from Churchill ready to roll Breeders' Cup with some uh\n... you know obviously going deep or on the pick for ... cetera so that's all going to be there I Know you're excited for that and we're going to have good racing and Senate need as well they always do and they have a good car there today so let's quickly jumped to a Santa Anita you're going to look at the last race\nIt let's look at the last race you I like the later races on the card is more pliable I Will say that there's a nice trifecta opportunity and raise nine and I like the weight pick for but let's look at race eleven\nAnd a in raised eleven I think a number eleven limbo locks\nIs a very generous or you know seven to two I would've said limbo luck should maybe two to one or even nine to five and I think by about ... a winner of the last two as sort of had a career revival has really one more races at Santa and either were races the systems easily than anybody else in the field\nFive words at Santa Anita five wins a going out of this\nThe six for a long distance and drive outside of everybody where he can't get in trouble I don't mind the outside post at Santa needed at all and I think ... walks\nA well a very strong contender here to put together three straight dropping out of a twelve thousand five a starter allows company back the thousand dollar level but he just a fee to back a while but walks with a Giovanni Franco aboard\nA saved up to them like a glove and I think a wearable looks is a good one to close it out at a trifecta anchor as well\nOK potential single there may be in a play pick for pick three et cetera the eleven land Bullock's in race eleven or to close the show that than any of that race should go off around five o'clock how we play around the eleven\nAt will use two horses are key than there were two wars as it came out of the same key race a number eight St Reno kind of showed a resurgence last time a and a get a nice ride to upgrade the title or base today uh and uh uh the trader or the race has a very high percentage just on the spot\nOr add the horse that just finished like a net apart from epilepsy number one rubber do are also a kind of kicked it into gear last time\nAnd up boosted dispute figure by nearly ten points or whether it be remodeled board can't go wrong with a baby so we use those who was the key is with liable walks will play a fifty cent trifecta eleven would want to eat with ... with all with one eight\nWill play a one eight without whatever little and what's box of a fifty cent trifecta one eight eleven\nAlright again that is race eleven and a key the eleven land Bullock's with the one and ate\nA nice hit yesterday Markey's water Eighteen twenty is a nice score you had three wins last Saturday at Santa Anita two more on Sunday so what's a with Belmont out off let's focus on Saturday and make it happen over the course of the weekend and then we will jump in and the and go full Breeders' Cup\nA starting on friday and I know you're already having been a lot of the work already we can tell so Jay appreciate it\nHave yourself a great weekend and we'll talk to your next Saturday bar I think it is All right Jay free lander he's ready Steve politics ready Roger new Bowers ready\nBrent is back from Hawaii still smiling running the board and uh I'm Jason levine excited for Breeders' Cup friday and Saturday we will ah do as much as we can for you to help you out there but to have a great weekend knock 'em dead today and we will talk to you next week right here at seven go get a [noise]\n\n\n\nI'm so said festival let me make a distinction between debt and deficit because I think it's it's often confused so all federal debt is what we've been amassing over the years and it currently sets it above Twenty one trillion dollars\nIn deficit is something different that looks an annual revenue coming in tax revenue buses and you'll spend now with the debt and deficit together if you're in huge amounts of debt\nAnd you have a deficit how are you going to clear your debt so that tied together but artsy leader Mitch McConnell that\nBrought it up and he pinned the rising budget on the excessive federal spending programs and he said to very clearly this isn't a policy issue this is a bipartisan issue this is something we all need to look at ...\nAnd this problem is obviously very disturbing we're we're spending more than we're taking at the bottom line is exactly right and funnily enough Mitch McConnell described it in exactly the same way very ... maybe I should run for Senate I think that's a good on my vote okay thank you\nHow does this affect investment opportunities\nLooking it has a ... I mean this is a nation US government if the U.S government has a huge amount of debt they don't have the money to pay it it creates can son in the ... the markets and then you have that ripple effect on deficit right now are\nFor the for the fiscal year ending September the ... was seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars on spending has been growing aggressively whilst tax revenue stayed flat it it's a big problem\nSo where do you think our deficit is heading\nIn the wrong direction we so we use or Seventeen percent deficit increase from from the one year period prior to that so the trend is up and all the deficit is projected to be over trillion dollars within the next couple of years\nOn my how does how is that going to affect individual Americans I it's pretty\nSimple really I mean more debt and higher deficits dip into the pocket but on the individual she debt and deficit tends to drive up interest rates as we've been seeing which leads to slow economic growth\nSlow economic growth in ... in turn leads to to lower wages which leads to an overall lower standard of living plus you look at all call house tuition payments everything starts to become more expensive\nI mean even in the grocery store you we've already seen you know pricing going\nThat's inflation mark and it's happening every single day and funnily enough when the government calculate inflation today they tend to ignore things like food and energy and key metric so I think the real inflation rate is probably a little bit higher than the government said\nOr maybe even more than a little bit [laughter] it seems that way I'm trying to be noisier gotcha what about investment opportunity does that slowed down also is the deficit goes up or or are there more opportunities such as precious metals their\nOwn way so that you no matter what the market is right there are times when there are huge opportunities in the stock market there are times when there are a huge opportunities elsewhere I think one thing that he's he\nIs at this market to some degree reeks of manipulation whether it's the Federal Reserve manipulating vi our interest rates you know the\nQuantitative easing whatever it might be reeks of manipulation and I think this is always been my view manipulation is a bad thing if you know the winner of mine because if you're aware of it you can use it to your advantage it weighs creates opportunities and my son and we see that in precious metals right now\nFill up we're going to take some time out tell people how they can get some free information that could help them

rates to aggressively and essentially stated that that was the reason we saw such a big drop in the markets um\nSo you know he's blaming the fed ultimately for last week's drop in the markets and he's been condemned from uh for that and quite frankly I see both sides that at all given so I understand where he's coming from but obviously I understand the Federal Reserve has a job to do as well so the balance like\nWell the raising the interest rates is too is is to keep inflation down right that's one ... what other reasons are therefore raising that interest\nLook at the end of the day we have to have interest rates at a at a decent level we use a drop in interest rates as a tool to pull ourselves out of trouble right well the economy appears at least on the surface to be taking alone when else do you raise rates now Trump once rates low\nBecause he's really pushing the idea of a healthy economy on his presidency so the last thing he wants to see is a stock market crash before his second term or who then the next election ultimately\nUm but at the same time what the Federal Reserve can do they need tools available to them a typically when we have a major correction the federal
