{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "Non World Series playoff series ever\nOh I agree the four teams remaining or oh tremendous I really thought of Milwaukee went all them last night\nTo get to get\nSomething that they were supposed to do which is the winner at home I Know it was ... and everything but they may have won the battle and lose the war on that one because they just\nUh they emptied their bank they emptied the tank that's well so\nYeah it's a day you know it's going to be interesting to see how this philosophy plays out against the very tough Dodger team of very deep Dodger team that can handle the switch and yeah I don't know uh I I agree that was a while to go that strong in game ...\nIf the Dodgers can win one or two and make this six or seven game series wow you got to think they're going to have the advantage seeing all these pitchers a bunch of times\nAnd kind of a running through him so going to be a lot of fun and or the other side I think the Astros and Red Sox are probably the two best teams so one of them is out after this is going to be fun to see All right I think we should Roger as always great job and we will talk to you next week\nThank you\nAll right you got it Roger ... for the red hot thorough graft connections\nA they got Belmont England and Senate need are ready to roll and it's been quite a role so a good for them we got Jay free lander locked up on the other side waiting shopping at the bit awesome baseball teams as well and that definitely Belmont needed for you to listen to the inside racing on am eleven fifty may be right back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmission gates open it can dirty CNN eating racing in great value in a world class setting\nFor official rules and more information about contests on this station during a patriot donnelley slash rules this is the Patriot am eleven fifty\n[noise]\nHave free lander spring among\nFuture\nGoing forward so I'll be rooting for\nYeah that's a she'll be on friday there's a couple of other very strong belief that horse ... can harbor one back in New York the wrestlers writer and we'll we'll keep an eye on it for sure I'm All right let's jump into that you had a what four wins last Sunday that was nice to have the free place on moral\nWired wire yet again um and uh a nice big trifecta Belmont last Saturday and you want to start back there around here\nLet's start a Belmont I and I do want to say you want to work a strongly up the horizontal layers of Belmont today the pick threes fours and five I think that you know there's some shorter price horses and you can really key on some horses and you know maybe a spread a little bit of one like\nI'll look it up while feminine either the opposite normally you get the shorter present family but there's some big places out there with those big field today so let's let's start at Belmont will look at the uh\nYeah no question about it so the key here this three lady Alexandra at a distance and course that she loves how we planted\nOrgan apply a trifecta or going to throw one more in order to throw in a number six chilies Willie a who's a was poor for five before or just a you know getting over maps and fix competition I don't think she was a threat to win the race but I think maybe she could be the one that kind of squeezed as well out of all those runner best today\nAnd key allies trifecta Jonathan Thomas's just had a huge breakthrough year as a trader so a really liking that one underneath will play a track factors follows will play a three ten\nWith three six panel at all and then we'll play three ten with all with three six data and hopefully get low opt out of there and just in case a Chili's well it does show up for it enough to when latoya fifty cent trifecta box labor three six ten\nOkay again till easily would be the price of the three there are six but the the most likely winner your opinion I think probably in in a better opinion will be the three lady Alexandra we're talking about race ate\nAt Belmont Park on a pretty nice car back there and I know there's some races you like they're so we're looking at Belmont today and then we jumped out to the great race plays\nThat what could have raised ten and we'll have to see if there's one or stay on after\nA just a may not um but that's okay because of the worst I lecture do just fine or if it's a move through the dirt ah and ah last time out a ...\nA road or be a number of three or as a and that was a great return to a nice finished last time broke a broker made while and then came on and a finished well first time it was winters\nUp but they're kind of nice closing style and I don't really like that closing fell as much from the inside draw a and the other contender that's also inside number two well hello same thing kind of a an inside closer and when you have a lot of horses in a big field outside of you\nI'm not crazy about those one two three opposed to what I Do like ... is our number nine ... who are draws while outside a chatty came back from a long way off\nAnd uh what was the head of a a great return for a while and then almost kind of faded a little bit like\nA first try on purpose to be expected you know from a almost a year lay off after the war way up from that today\nA draws outside should with the tax will speed should have a clear advantage early over well hello and great return or it's dark and five and a if this comes off the great return might even come out so you might be down to just to conductors chatty over well hello so uh I I think China is going to get first run on those too and like\nCharlie to hold on a lot better today and I like Chinese chances regardless of the surface\nOkay very good and that is important this race probably fifty fifty to come off the grass with all the the rain and all that come across in the dirt there the nine chatty turf were dirt in race ten how do you play it\nAh it's a very attractive but again it's an easy one to remember will play out just those three horses we talked about two or three nine with two three nine with all and two or three nine with all with two or three nine and a it's still pliable up at three comes out\nYes it is absolutely and the key again being the nine Tyler base for like I said very hot trainer Mike mccarthy former assistant to top pleasure who's a really picked it up out here the last six months or so\nOr has the nine chatty in race tend to three nine to three nine with all and then slipping it to close the show at Santa Anita Jay as always appreciate it a good luck today Belmont and Santa Anita and I know you're you've got your Breeders' Cup\nA future hat on watching everything and starting to to analyze and it's going to be a lot of fun as we get down the closer to it for three weeks away and counting down\n... labor to have a great day and bring those relatives\nYeah there we go see what happens with the ah the weather out here but we can still play it's not like everything melts for good and uh so Jay appreciate it a on behalf of Jay and Roger and Steve and Brett running the board and may CEO Parker\nMaking us feel good I'm Jason living as always Saturdays and seven were here on the inside race and do all we can for you're trying to have some fun make some money so I have a great day wherever you play whatever you do be safe and go get them we'll talk to your next week right here at seven\n\nAnd\nNine [noise]\n\n\nBehind right what what is Trump showing to achieve with ... as well he's trying to plug the trade deficit I we import a lot more than we export so he's trying to clog math can't\nMind posing tariffs on foreign products coming into the United states you might did being mall that if we tax these products coming in to make more expensive\nAnd of course make house more competitive here in the U.S for all good no idea was to boost manufacturing homes and to create more Joe\n... how does this affect the the stock market and end goal and precious metal\nLooking has a significant effect on on those things but I think the important question is actually you know Don do these things work\nBecause it's not a question that I think I think dictates the ... to the others and\nYou know it's a mixed bag they're on opposite sides to it and sunsets and seem ready positive effect steel aluminum right and we have but heavy tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum making US Steel and aluminum more ... more attractive and of course you know we've seen a boom now\nWhat we sail I think to understand was the negative effect might many sent is affected negatively like these tumors we mentioned steel and aluminum right and saying hey\nYou manufacturers of steel and aluminum here in the United states ... benefits in that\nYou can turn that on its head what about companies that are currently relying on importing steel and aluminum from China that's become significant more interesting if you look at the food and beverage industry for example really struggling because ... increased prices them in a ...\nHappening and I'm I'm Sorry I interrupted which what's happening is that we raise the terrorists they put a terrorist and its back and forth and you know everything was all said and I think within the last week or ten days\nI'm from a recording and the president just said well let's go back and talk more about terrorists with China I mean it's going it's constant\n... you're exactly right and these these retaliate to retire is that are causing the problems as well because or do we ... we do a sport too and if we're hitting a tennis on them way getting it straight\nMakeup industry in the United states really struggling at the moment we export a lot of makeup to Europe they've imposed tariffs and we're seeing the same issues and reverse the reality is they're not really working in fact\nIt's hurting more sectors that means helping the next ... come for the U.S looks to be negative\nAnd there are significant trickle effect some experts believe J. P. Morgan being a good example global growth could slow by close to ... percent if countries targeted by the U.S respond with equivalent tariffs and that's been happening\nQuite frankly marked for me it's really counter intuitive it's almost anti capitalist right that the U.S economy as we know it today was built on the idea of laissez faire leave the economics it has worked for over a hundred years and we're going back home\nAnd buy laissez faire economics what you're saying is that we export to them they and we in for it to us and there are no tariffs that kinda thing\nYeah and leave the laissez faire means leave they let people trade freely a free market economy it was smoke\nIf why you're listening to our show and you have any questions you want to talk to a precious metals specialist at the bridge goal group directly all you have to do is call that number\nEight hundred or two two thirty three eighty eight that's eight hundred or two two thirty three eighty\nEight or go on line to birch gold dot com slash radio with the tariffs how will it affect jobs the the the the the market and precious metals\nLook I think what we established is is going to have a deal effect on jobs writes a new industries is triggering increase jobs but I think the overall effect is negative when losing jobs as well as gaining and I think the net effect is negative\nFill up what impact might the trade wars have on precious metals\nI mean I think they should have a positive effect on on on precious metal flood wall we've established is that you know most experts and we we spoke to bounce AP moving previously they think it will lead to a slowdown in global growth\nOkay now slow down and gross has very negative implications for many markets he doesn't bode well for the stock market it's thousands bode well for currency\nBut remember what we know about gold and silver in times of decline in times of currency declined the market that clean safe haven assets become incredibly a trend\nThey grow and they perform and again we look at that last market crashed to understand why the effect that can that\nFunction very well as a means of protecting and preserving wealth you see as currency declines\nGold prices move right it takes more of that we cut currency to buy gold hence being at a very effective means of preserving buying power and protecting against inflation\nAnd its that scale analogy review several times but it's the scales justice right there they tip one way and they took the other they tip one way they ... at the other\n... exactly you know the idea here is the head yourselves look at the end of the day more can you take every penny you haven't put it into gold the answer is no you need to go to the grocery store you have to buy groceries you need currency in order to do that well what about the currency that's going to be sitting in your bank account for a year or two or three\nWell what are you getting an interest mark on that\nVery liberal in this climate right\nRight well with inflation rising that currency loses money every single day as the dollar fools that currency loses money every single day by having a portion of your wealth and metals the idea is that it it goes off in the climate and it serves to protect a growing power\nIt protects the buying power of the money or the currency that you have on the other side of that scale exactly correct if why you're listening to our show and you have any questions and want to talk to a precious metals specialist at the bridge gold group directly all you have to do is call that number\nEight hundred or two two thirty three eighty eight that's eight hundred or two two thirty three eighty\nEight or go on line to birch gold dot com slash radio how easy is it to own precious metals it's very easy\nNow mount a officer off to the Nineteen seventies we're we're we're allowed to buy gold and silver again and I would say ... groups make it even easier and for our customers whether they are looking to purchase in cash or through a retirement account we have the expertise we have the structure to make that happen\nYou know the other day I was talking to a friend of mine who's a financial advisor he's my financially and and I asked him I said you know I'm thinking about owning goal what do you think you see already own goal I\nSaid what do you mean I don't go I didn't get a delivery I did see a truck come in with armed guards and he said no no no you own your own gold paper gold mhm tell us about pay for gold or I guess each he apps\nYour correct the T eh for uh otherwise known as exchange traded funds that would be the pay per equivalent of physical methods ... great it's a different sort of thing you know you buy a physical assets it holds in ... man right\nNot only that it is a currency in on itself sent me all skew the value of your E. T. F. it's denominated in in which currency dollars US dollars so it's a dollar denominated assets but more importantly than any of that is\nI Would say the overwhelming majority of vps are significantly over leverage them All right so the concept of an ATF is quite simple let's say I'm a bank\nAnd I put a hundred answers of gold enough votes right by selling shares in ... so you got a piece of paper says you are on three of ... is the problem is is most of the big ATM\nAre significantly over leverage they're selling anywhere from a thousand to three thousand announces on the back of the hundred that they have and the volt now I Would say the overwhelming majority of our customers are looking for preservation\nThey're looking for security in my mind it's counter intuitive to move into an\nThat that's so heavily ... doesn't make sense\nCan you explain or give us a definition of over leveraged I mean I think we have the idea and let me see if I have it right so I own I'm a bank and I own a hundred ounces of gold but I sell it to self three thousand ounces of goals is that basically it\nThat's basically it mark and the concept is very loosely if everybody goes to cash in these E. T. F. that one state I didn't have the the physical to to me that so it creates an issue\nWow that's a that's amazing so clearly having physical goal is the way to go the ATF labs just don't work out\nI mean they were count is is probably is from way to say that but what I Would say is that it depends on what you're trying to achieve right if you're looking to trade you buy sell by cell by cell by cell something like an ATF may work as a vehicle for you\nBut if you're looking to preserve you're looking to protect while you're looking for a tangible asset that's not exposed to balance sheet that's removed from the financial system to some degree the physical asset is far preferable for that sort of strategy\nAnd we've talked about this in the past but I Want to reiterate do I have to take physical possession because my house may not be protected against those who might want to take that\nThe new ... reason we suddenly know forcing miss on your side for cash the check is you have the choice I have some customers don't want to hold onto it I have others that done if you've done there are many options available you can store within a fully license insured depository bank safe deposit boxes work as well\nOn the IRA side it's a little bit different the IRA as a tax deferred vehicle these are ... they require a depository initially house those metals but should do you decide you want them at home you have the option um distribution\n... with an IRA can after it's been in the depository can I take possession of it or is that cashing out the IRA\nHideous cashing out so that ultimately you have all this you have stocks and an account you want to sell you got to sell and take the cash out because of the ... this account you have options you can sell the medals bank within the IRA and create cash take a test distribution all\nBecause of its physical made to the IRS allow you to take an income distribution which is the ability to take physical possession once you do it does become taxable like any of the IRA distribution\nLet's talk about your history for a couple of moments I mean you know Phillip Patrick's history you've been involved in the gold industry for how long\nI I've been in precious metals specifically for almost ten years so it it's been a long time prior to that I was a banker I was in the city ban covers of wealth manager for ... for many years prior so I've always been in this case the precious metal ... posted ten years now among\nUh this is the Bert gold report I'm Mark gallon along with Philip Patrick senior precious metal specialist at the ... group and they have some special information that's been designed to educate and inform you so that you can understand\nAll about precious metal and you can get this information very simply by calling eight hundred or two two thirty three eighty eight that's eight hundred or two two thirty three eighty eight\nI pick up the phone you get a free absolutely no obligation no obligation at all\n... get that will delineate how and why owning precious metals is important for you and I keep adding to your family because it's not just you it's your whole family give them a call right now speak to a precious metals specialist\nEight hundred or two to three three eighty eight get your information get now and by the way you can also go to bridge gold dot com slash radio that's B. I. R. C. H. goal dot com slash radio and Rick west you're bringing ... hit that way as well\nWe just have a ... a moment or two left in this segment\nBill of what is the number one reason you believe that somebody say in their sixties should take a look at owning precious metals specifically gold and maybe even adding it to their IRA\nI Would say that typically in one sixties you're either a retired or have at least one on my own time and then you know my argument is is really key you hate your sixties can you afford\nThat seven to ten year markets like you know we've talked a lot about where things set in terms of the numbers the stock market we understand the market's a cyclical we see correction and it takes us five to seven to ten years to come by\nSomebody in their sixties needs to be more cautious than somebody in their twenties for obvious reasons so I think you know we're Twenty years old the stock market crashes who says we're not going to be looking at this IRA for another forty years but when you're in your sixties it's\nTime to be more conservative it's time to hedge and to protect that's like\nYou know it's funny because I remember in two thousand and eight after the crash after the the market went\nCrazy ... people had to go back to work they ... they didn't know what to do they had planned for retirement and they couldn't I spoke to somebody today and as a badge gears is going back to work because you ran out of money right", "year": "2018", "show_name": "21st Century Pain Institute", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "13"}
