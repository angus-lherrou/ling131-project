I have no fear number ten micro rhythms are in the eighth of Santa Anita\nAll right there you go again a horse that we have not seen on the track since July of last year but uh there's I don't think anybody's ever been better and bringing horses off long lay offs and Bob effort it's ridiculous I mean he's just turned the game on its head\nAnd that this is actually one of the things he does best so again like you said new building or the ten micro rhythm seven to two in the morning ... Van Dyke\nAbout forty percent writing for ... uh and uh that's number ten in race eight straight up play\nCent trifecta Jason also wrote number twelve a jungle warfare and the try a let's play at ten micro those with for twelve that's the favorite on with jungle warfare with all ten with all with for twelve or for twelve with ten with all and the saber for twelve with ... with down\nThere we go to the cheap saver at the end for twelve for twelve with ten but the key here at the ten micro rhythms in race eight coming back often over a year layoffs Bob effort at Santa Anita and are really sneaky nice card at the great race plays but then we'll go where the the class erasing is Belmont working your\nCall let's go let's go to Belmont first we'll go to the champagne\nAnd the favorite here is our number for complexity there's a lot of well bred horses that have run well especially with the Saratoga me\nAnd I think you're going to see a number of future stinks stars come out of this race that's a very precocious race you've got complexity of five to to uh you've got endorsed on the route one nice which are a toga seven to two you've got a call\n... remember that one you've got called Paul who's the third choice in here just wanting to Saratoga special ed or four to one\nAnd we're gonna try to beat of all the day I was looking at number two trophy chaser\nTend to one a ... was racing that a gulfstream parking gulfstream parts racing in the in the summer in the fall is not up to what it is during the championship meet in the spring\nBut it's still quality racing and this one just a flood old has posed by Fifteen legs breaking is made her name the only triple digit a British figure in the field at one of two on the scale out of people watching this horse work after the rates were just raving about trophy chaser just looks like a million bucks\nHowdy and not take a shot with this guy attended one number two trophy chase her in the champagne\nOkay you get a junior Alvarado writing for one of the law and or like you said that last race is pretty off the charts has had six or seven weeks since working great down at ... and they obviously think a lot of the horse to ship 'em up and take on\nCalled the big boys and all the big barns her represented in here this is the champagne and every good two year old and New York is in this race so\nUh that that's something for them to ship up and say okay we want some of this [noise]\nUm the two trophy chaser and raised in a straight up it's going to be tied one and you'll get it\nYeah and I think it goes Seventy openly exotic side but we'll plan exact will play a a full grown apart we'll play a dollar exact or to at all and then we use the other six I think one of the race one four five six eight nine with the two trophy chaser\nOr some of the best forces in Europe at the time and I came out nicely to twelve horse field a rally by sort of finish third I think about for nowhere or is kind of the the class at this field at Fifteen on these steel liking number fourteen founded nowhere nice when in place bad about an hour\nAll right again this is the Chevy Volt turf mile a it is probably the best race of the day anywhere it's raised ten ... and it's going to have to work out a trip that is a tough post going a mile on the grass but a\nJulio Garcia knows the horses written him very well two for two key inland on this horse is going to take a shot here for some big money or what should be a pretty nice price the fourteen bound for nowhere\nAt ... this will be a trifecta as well will use the poor chamber with some of those horses we've already mentioned in the interest of the time I won't mention again fourteen with five seven channel eleven with all and then let's play a five seven title Evan with fourteen with five seven ten eleven and throw them in the third spot five seven eleven with five seven eleven with fourteen\nAll right there you go bomb that will pay a company come in very

pay down the reality is that the Basinger increasing the money supply devalued currency unavoidably\nIn your opinion is the UN is proceeding responsible\nOn frankly the answer is no and as we get deeper into this week in understanding how other nations are reacting to this policy it's starting to the question is how do you protect yourself in the meantime\nSo the question is obvious how do I protect myself how to our listeners protect themselves\nTheir families from the declining dollar\nLook gold has always been an incredibly effective means so now we talked about the Weimar Republic we had seen back then a currency but the last ... all of its than it was gold that allowed people to protect wealth\nYour friends kind of um they had to do so much that they have a breaking point when print takes over and then not just bring them back for a high tech kings dominion what books do you do the limits of fear\nComes to like nights through October twenty eight nine ... creatures ...

and how you can legally move your IRA or four oh one K. they do a ...\nThere is a an idea behind it like what what he's from going to achieve with ... as well he's trying to plug the trade deficit right we import a lot more than we export so he signed a plug Matt damp\nMind posing tariffs on foreign products coming into the United states you know idea being that if we tax these products coming into making more expensive and of course make us more competitive here in the U.S\nFor all good so you know ideas to boost manufacturing home and to create more Joe\n... how does this affect\nThe the stock market and uh and gold and precious metals\nLook he has a significant effect on on those things but I think the important question is actually you know Donald do these things work because it's not a question that I think I think dictates the on says to the others and\nYou know it's a mixed bag they're on opposite sides to it and sudden sexism and seem ready positive effect steel aluminum right and\nWe have but heavy tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum making US Steel and aluminum more ... more attractive and of course you know we've seen a boom now\nWhat we sail I think to understand was the negative effect might many sectors affected negatively by these tumors we mentioned steel and aluminum right in saying hey\nYou know manufacturers of steel and aluminum here in the United states ... benefits in but\nYou can turn that on its head what about companies that are currently relying on importing steel and aluminum from China that's become significant more expensive if you look at the food and beverage industry for example really struggling because ... increased prices for them and know what's happening\nI'm Sorry I interrupted with what's what's happening is that we've raised the terrorists they put a tariff and its back and forth ... you know everything was all said and\nI think within the last week or ten days of from our recording the president has said well let's go back and talk more about\nTerrorists with China I mean it's going it's constant\nYou're exactly right and these these retaliate to retire if that are causing the problems as well because or do we ... we do export too\nAnd if we're hitting a tariff on them way getting hit straight back the makeup industry in the United states really struggling at the moment we export a lot of makeup to Europe they've imposed tariffs and we're seeing the same issues in reverse the reality is they're not really working in fact\nIt's hurting more sectors that means helping the net outcome for the U.S looks to be negative\nAnd there are significant trickle effect some experts believe they pay more in being a good example global growth could slow by close to ... percent if countries targeted by the U.S respond with the quibbling tariffs and that's been happening\nQuite frankly marked for me it's really counter intuitive it's almost anti capitalist right that the U.S economy as we know today was bill on the idea of laissez faire leave the economics it has worked for over a hundred years and we're going back home\nAnd buy laissez faire economics what you're saying is that we export to them they and we import to us and there are no terrorists that kinda thing\nYeah and leave the laissez faire means leave they let people trade freely a free market economy it was small\nIf why you're listening to our show and you have any questions and want to talk to a precious metals specialist at the bridge gold group directly all you have to do is call that number\nEight hundred or two two thirty three eighty eight that's eight hundred or two two thirty three eighty eight\nOr go on line to birch gold dot com slash radio with the tariffs how will it affect jobs the the the the the market and precious metals\nLook I think what we established is is going to have a deal effect on jobs writes a new industries is increased jobs but I think the overall effect is negative when losing jobs as well as gaining and I think the net effect is negative\nFill up what impact might the trade wars have on precious metals\nI mean I think they should have a positive effect on on on precious metals look what we've established is that you know most experts and we we spoke about taping moving previously they think it will lead to a slowdown in global growth\nOkay now slow down and gross has very negative implications for many markets he doesn't bode well for the stock market it doesn't bode well for currency but remember what we know about gold and silver\nIn times of decline in times of currency declined the market that clean safe havens assets become incredibly attract\nThey grow and they perform and I again we look at that last market crashed to understand quite the effect that can that\nFunction very well as a means of protecting and preserving wealth you see as currency declines gold prices move\nRight it takes more of that week a currency to buy gold hence being a very effective means of preserving buying power and protecting against inflation\nAnd its that scale analogy we've used several times but it's the scales justice right there they tip one way and they ... the other tip one way they said the other\nExactly you know the idea here is the head yourself look at the end of the day more can you take every penny you haven't put it into gold\nThe altar is no you need to go to the grocery store you have to buy groceries you need currency in order to do that about what about the currency this going to be sitting in your bank account for a year or two or three well what are you getting an interest mark on that very liberal in this climate right\nRight well with inflation rising that currency loses money every single day as the dollar fools that currency loses money every single day by having a portion of your wealth and metals the idea is that it it goes off in the climate and it serves to protect a growing pound\nIt protects the buying power of the money the currency that you have on the other side of that scale exactly correct if why you're listening to our show and you have any questions and want to talk to a precious metals specialist at the bridge gold group directly all you have to do is call that number\nEight hundred or two two thirty three eighty eight that's eight hundred or two two thirty three eighty\nEight or go on line to birch gold dot com slash radio how easy is it to own precious metals\nIs very easy now mount a officer off to the Nineteen seventies we're we're we're allowed to buy gold and silver again and I would say ... groups make it even easier um for our customers whether they are looking to purchase in cash or through a retirement account we have the expertise we have the structure to make that happen\nYou know the other day I was talking to a friend of mine who's a financial advisor he's my financially and and I asked\nHim I said you know I'm thinking about owning goal what do you think you already own goal\nI said what do you mean I don't go I didn't get a delivery I did see a truck come in with armed guards and he said no no no you own your own gold paper gold ... tell us about pay for gold or I guess ATF ths\nYour correct the T eh for ah otherwise known as exchange traded funds that would be the pay per equivalent of physical methods ... great it's a different sort of thing you know you buy a physical assets it holds in ... man right\nNot only that it is a currency in on itself let me ask you the value of your E. T. F. it's denominated in in which currency dollars US dollars so it's a dollar denominated assets but more importantly\nThan any of that is\nI Would say the overwhelming majority of the ts significantly over leverage them All right so the concept of an ATF is quite simple let's say I'm a bank and I put a hundred ounces of gold enough votes right\nTell you she adds in ... so you got a piece of paper says you only three of ... is\nThe problem is is most of the big ATMs\nAre significantly over leverage they're selling anywhere from a thousand to three thousand announces on the back of the hundred that they have in their vote now I Would say the overwhelming majority of all customers\nAre looking for preservation they're looking for security in my mind it's counter intuitive\nTo move into an asset that's heavily young for that for two thousand make sense\nCan you explain or give us a definition of over leveraged I mean I think we have the idea and let me see if I have it right so I own I'm a bank and I own a hundred ounces of gold but I sell it to self three thousand ounces of goals is that basically it\nThat's basically it marketing the concept is very loosely if everybody goes to cash in these E. T. F. set one state I have the the physical to\nTo meet that so it creates an issue\nWow I mean that's a that's amazing\nSo clearly having physical goal is the way to go the ATF labs just don't work out\nI mean they were count is is probably is from way to say that but what I Would say is that it depends on what you're trying to achieve right if you are looking to trade by cell by cell by cell by cell something like an ATF may work as a vehicle for you\nBut if you're looking to preserve you're looking to protect while you're looking for a tangible asset that's not exposed to balance sheet that's removed from the financial system to some degree the physical asset is far preferable for that sort of strategy\nAnd we've talked about this in the past but I Want to reiterate do I have to take physical possession because my house may not be protected against those who might want to take that the\nYeah I mean ... reason we suddenly know forcing miss on your side for cash the check is you have the choice and I have some cost them is the one to hold on to it I have others that\nDone if you've done there are many options available you can store within a fully license insured depository bank safe deposit boxes work as well\nOn the IRA side it's a little bit different the IRA as a tax deferred vehicle these off pretense sons they require a depository initially house those levels but should do you decide you want 'em at home you have the option on distribution\nWithin IRA can after it's been in the depository can I take possession of it or is that cashing out the IRA\nHideous cashing out so that ultimately you have all you have stocks and an account you want to sell you got to sell and take the cash out because of the ... this account you have options you can sell the medals back within the IRA and create cash take a test distribution all\nBecause of its physical nature the IRS allow you to take an income distribution which is the ability to take physical possession once you do it does become taxable like any of the IRA distribution\nLet's talk about your history for a couple of moments I mean you know Phillip Patrick's history you've been involved in the gold industry for how long\nI I've been in precious metals specifically for almost ten years so it it's been a long time prior to that or he was a banker I worked for city ban covers of wealth manager for ... for\nMany years prior so I've always been in this space that precious metals ... close to ten years now among\nUh this is the Bert gold report I'm Mark gallon along with Philip Patrick senior precious metal specialist at the ... group and they have some special information that's been designed to educate and inform you that you can understand\nAll about precious metal and you can get this information very simply by calling eight hundred or two two thirty three eighty eight that's eight hundred or two two thirty three eighty eight I pick up the phone you get a free\nAbsolutely no obligation no obligation at all\n... get that will\nDelineate how and why owning precious metals is important for you and I keep adding to your family because it's not just you it's your whole family give them a call right now speak to a precious metals specialists\nEight hundred or two to three three eighty eight get your information get now and by the way you can also go to Bert gold dot com slash radio that's be IRC age goal dot com slash radio and Rick west you're bringing ... hit that way as well\nWe just have a ... a moment or two left in this segment\nBill of what is the number one reason you believe that somebody say in their sixties should take a look at owning precious metals specifically gold and maybe even adding it to their IRA\nI Would say that typically in one sixties you're either a retired or have at least one eye on time and then\nYou know my argument is is really key you hate your sixties\nCan you afford that seven to ten year markets like you know we've talked a lot about ... set in terms of the numbers the stock market we understand the market's a cyclical we see correction and it takes us five to seven to ten years to come by\nSomebody in their sixties needs to be more cautious than somebody in their twenties for obvious reasons so I think\nYou know we're Twenty years old the stock market crashes who cast we're not going to be looking at this IRA for another forty years but when you're in your sixties it's time to be more conservative it's time to hedge and to protect that's like\nYou know it's funny because I remember in two thousand and eight after the crash after the the market went crazy ... people had to go back to work they ...", "show_name": "21st Century Pain Institute", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "06"}
