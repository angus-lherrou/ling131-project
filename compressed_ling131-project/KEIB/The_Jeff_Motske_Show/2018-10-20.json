tribute 'cause you're like Mr trivial pursuit they're not going to give you [laughter]\nAlready that I I figured that you're walking encyclopedia why why are we going to\nDo that I'm not the sound of all knowledge but I'm constantly trying to improve my knowledge sometimes embellish on my knowledge\nAnd uh let's not go see of dollars from a ride in it and it's the facts ma'am yeah just the fact that if you want to participate in show a eight hundred three nine nine nine six three seven eight hundred three nine nine nine six or seven or you can write in and ask Jeff a trilogy fs dot com ask Jeff a trilogy\nYou know life spans now that's halfway their their their their their retirement is not the finish line that's the the midpoint of this journey and so to sit there and they talk about you know their income and they're expensive but they don't talk about what their quality of life is going to be during those times yeah we\nSpend a lot of time and this this entire month we're talking about finishing well and really when you look at retirement I think people would associate finishing wild and retirement we also talked about estate planning and finishing where mark Lewis on earlier talking about that but finishing while I'm finishing well is\nBeing able to do what you want and when you want and being able to enjoy your life and whatever that next purposes and a lot of times\nPeople just trying to get through the day they're just trying to get through the the week in the paper and putting a little bit of money aside um\nFrom my from my standpoint I've had the luxury of telling lots of people you've you've made your declared financial independence\nHowever five years in to that point a lotta times are asking me\nJeff ... am I still okay you know the words are we still okay we're still going to have enough money and they're still not super comfortable the fact that yeah you're in great shape um how do you convince people what do you do to help people understand that there there are over the hump so to speak when it comes to in that thriving space [noise]\nThat's a good question it's it really depends on\nWhere they're at a mentally I mean some folks they're just they they openly accepted\nUm other folks they they need to see it and and that's where I'm some services that I provide a along the side with my advisory team\nWhere we're able to illustrate a specifically a either it's specific scenario is that um they have questions about that that kind of have to do with a future values\nOr um it can be like you said currently where are you know here we still okay um\nSo we're able to provide them with the support that illustrates that um where they can actually see\nUh what their their current situation looks like and then we have tools that we can provide them or they will help to illustrate what things should continue to look like dependent on the the trend of whatever um they have in place as far as\nAnd they're playing yeah and I think you you mentioned something to cause retirement is more than just having the money and I think that we talked about in the show I by having a purpose I Want you talking about what you see it as in other words I've talked about what a purpose is what's the purpose to you what do you how do you talk to your clients in that area [noise]\nAs far as the purpose of that I provide for them yeah 'cause I mean they they've got the money let's just say they're in good shape and um you see it differently or you see this more than just the money aspect to how do you how do you look at it with them or how do you talk to them about it well\nWhat so what I Do is I I\nI we had a client meeting with my counterpart Nathan Brown I'm On our our wealth advisory team here some time ago and um this client he had a ... you know Nathan was the the servicing advisor in that meeting and he said that uh you know he was he was talking and communicating with with the client\nAnd the client interrupted him at one point and just said you know hold on a second here um you know you've got a lot of great things to say but you know this this person over here\nHad instead of words that anything what do you have to say and and I just looked at him and and I said well I said well what he asked was what would I get from a retaining\nYour services and so you know they can respond and then he turned to me and said so what do you think and I said look I'll be honest what you're basically doing is you're you would be a compensating us or to remain objective ah throughout your plan and and the wife of your plant\nA lot of folks they tend to make emotionally based decisions financially and that's that's on everything um and it's just natural but when you have a you know a financial coach financial advisor uh we help provide that objectivity in that context to keep your plan on task yeah and\nSo important and if you just tuned in and you're listening to the ... show I've got Matthew Philips
