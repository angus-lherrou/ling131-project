S. dot com where Paul the listener out there in Tucson, Arizona writes in Hi Justin mark I work with the young lady who seems to have very little control over her financial life\nWhen we first hired or she had to do for a lot of the questions concerning direct deposit and ten Ninety nine sir husbands she never seems to have cash or use credit cards while at work and I've heard her quite a few times arguing with her husband on the phone\nAs I'm In management I feel an obligation to address any abuse she may be experiencing but as you mentioned on your show there are plenty of couples who delegate financial matters to one spouse my question is who can how can you differentiate between delegation and financial abuse and if it's financial abuse\nWhat if anything can be done I Will say are out there listening posts\nI have a couple of households that are in the situation um I've taught my head\nAnd thinking about our our time together today um I've I've run into it a couple of times in the past ah with clients and and their parents having kids you know being stuck in the middle to and it gets really complicated especially if there's no long term care in place yeah so uh you know in particular I can think of a couple of scenarios\nUm probably about seven eight years ago I had a client whose mom was in her early nineties and it was a very wealthy a mom and dad and my client at the time was in her late fifties and there was never any long term care in place because it didn't occur to him they were so wealthy\nAnd over time mom went into a facility it was three thousand a month\nThen five and seven and by the time mom for her last twenty four months was in that facility was over ten thousand dollars a month because of the full time care and my client could not be they're providing the extra care said to pay for everything because she's working and taking her own kids\nAnd I think by the time that they were done and mom finally passed away they had blown through over four to four hundred thousand dollars\nAnd here's the thing four hundred thousand dollars in let's say it was in an Ira four one K. it's really I don't wanna say double that thing on tax brackets bright it says it's a much higher number\nBecause you've got to take out a lot more money to pay the tax and then pay for the cost to yeah um how do you rewind that scenario and let's say they came into your office and and mom wasn't end is near Washington facilities yet what what do you say to those parents that kind of inspire them to think differently than just sell funding\nWell ah so assuming that we're going back in time yeah with the ... Monday morning quarterback yeah OK so a mom is not Ninety mom sixty and we're going to talk about uh assuming a that it's still two thousand Nineteen\nAnd our two thousand Eighteen I should say time machine Jay's law yeah and uh we have access to decision coach decision center things like that we're going to do a detail financial plan for them and show them this is your forecast this is what it looks like it looks all rosy and great\nBut let me show you what it looks like if it gets a little rainy and we have some thunderstorm hurricanes things like that and I'm Talking about the hurricane thunderstorm of significant health care issues\nAnd let's look at the impact of your nest they should that happen now we're sixty years old here today and we're not Ninety we don't know Thirty years from now holds in store for us you could go quick you could have a prolonged health issue but\nIf you have that prolonged health issue your nest egg is going to get obliterated and now that you're armed with that information let's talk about the potential ways we can prevent this\nOkay cool and before you get into that I'm your tune into the ... show I've got David will it on right now a long time trilogy financial advisor in our Irvine location to connect with David\nOr go to Jeff ... dot com Jeff M. O. T. S. K. E. dot com and you click on the Irvine location hook on David ... his ... his background his team are working on one of his team members joined so that later ... joined us as well so what are the solutions they've\nUh a few different options of course you can sell fund and that's the scenario I just talked about a typical or long term care policy is out there and you have to be younger and healthy 'cause go figure insurance companies want to make a profit so if you're older and unhealthy they will not give you a policy\nUs a long term care is choice a universal life insurance policy is choice to be a and then there's hybrid a contracts things like that that you can get into and that's another option that people are looking at today\nAnd you then illustrate what that might look quite versus doing nothing and your plan gets obliterated deal then show them in the decision center what happens if you can act or what what my options are and what makes the most sense\nAbsolutely so we can run through a a typical long term care issue and see what the impact of those costs are a and then we can show the impact directly with how much we have to take out a savings and how much cash we're gonna blow through\nAnd and see now you're seeing the planning an action yeah now let's let's go back to the sandwich side of it okay and we had a call last week that the the daughter was going to move back into the house yeah you know just graduate from college got tons of debt going to go back into the house uh and and actually kind of in a passion type of profession\nWhich you know we all know how passionate professions usually pay\nUm how how do you handle that conversation if that ... that sandwich couple comes into your office\nFirst of all I I uh\nI offer him a glass of wine [laughter] uh to ease the stress and tension it they're they're experiencing but ah I've seen this a few times already so I've been doing this for a living out for fourteen years and I've seen generations evolve and grow um you know my my for one of my first house sold their kids are in college now it's crazy to see\nBut when I meet with people who are in this situation right now it's complicated it's really complicated and I tell them there's no scholarships for retirement\nSo when your kids are coming home in their late twenties early thirties and they are pursuing their passion rather than going out there and working hard\nI tell them you know what your kids are not going to take care of you when you are retired and that the rules of reverse so you need to make sure you're arming them not with money but with some intelligence to go out and say it's time to work hard and you can pursue your passion on the side\nAnd I think what David saying there is that you can use us a little bit to be the bad guy I've done it before right and and I say that a lot on the air is they use us to be the the voice of reason yeah those scenarios\nAnd get them to say look this this isn't going to work this this dog doesn't hunt so to speak to figure out how you're going to\nUm pursue that on the side but you need to start running an income if you want to move back in\nUm you know let's talk about rents and contracts and rules of what goes on in the house because these are really difficult topics and moms and dads a lotta times don't know how to deal with both ends of the spectrum because they're getting hit over here and they're getting hit down here and you said something I said this law to there's no scholarships for retirement mom and dad you need to make sure\nThat you're doing your plan um first and foremost so that you're not in that scenario because the number\nTwo problem with people in retirement is becoming a burden I loved ones number one is running out of money I think they kind of blend each other yeah too and and for this scenario you may have that where the\nTwenty eight year old daughter is you know causing all kinds of problems because you're supporting that particular person as well so you can be the bad guy there I have done it before and if you're listening out there give me a call do it for you [laughter]\nDavid will to connect with him again go to ... dot com Jeff M.
