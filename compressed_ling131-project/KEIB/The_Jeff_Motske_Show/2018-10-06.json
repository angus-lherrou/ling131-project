... in your Belinda a right to hide Jeff and Kimber I'm concerned about my cousin um she's been spending a lotta money lately it's not just that\nShe's spending but the behavior around that concerns me\nWhenever we're together launcher in the car she's constantly on her phone browsing retail side she seemed hyper focused on an gleeful about our purchases but if asked and the thing about our finances\nShe's affording off how she was forty ... purchased she gets defensive and really a key G and she says that her purchases make her feel happy her father recently passed away and that I should mind my own business and she's not hurting anyone\nI'm afraid she's hurting yourself do you have any suggestions on what I should do if anything impulsive are compulsive\nYes yes so listen a couple of things I'd like the listener to consider for she addresses her concern the first thing your cousin is grieving so you suspect that she's using compulsive shopping to fill a void\nSo you want an obvious they handled this with some kid class the next thing you notice things she's beaming rudely I mean when you're with somebody they shouldn't be surprising retail websites and hyper focused on spending that's not nice that's just simply not your cats and it's hurting you're feeling something else to consider before you approach this uh topic\nNext one she's defensive I always say about defense if people\nAsk yourself not does the comment hurt but is there any merit to it are there any truth to it that's really the question you should be asking yourself cousin um so now that I got out of the way how do you address or concern\nUm hey I've noticed you've been hyper focused on shopping and spending I'm really concerned that you're putting yourself in a bad financial situation pretty straightforward\nAnd it's very easy to get trapped in the retail side of things are the phrase I've heard a lot of times is retail therapy course offer things that obviously ... sounds like the father's passed away um and and they get into this mode\nAnd I'm screens are smart they're sending you stuff all the time if you're if you're in the social media space out there and you were just looking at shoes so to speak on by and large when you go to whatever I'm social media you're going to see those shoes pop up and so forth because they're going to be trying to suck you when to spend on top of that so you've got\nSomebody that's I don't want to say addictive\nThe scenario but certainly is enjoying that aspect of it and now they're getting sucked in by the brilliance of the marketing side of things to spend more money it's evil\nAre we just wanted to make the move now uh because rates are going up and what we found is actually it's becoming more of a buyer's market because\nRates are going up so prices are going down and there's more houses on the market um they're the house were buying it was on the market for two hundred and twenty five days they drop their price sixty five thousand dollars over the course of the year\nYeah so a Ford ability and I talk about this all the time and I remember the away to seven and I was early on that but I I just said look there are scenarios now where people can't afford the houses that are out there the prices have gone up so much\nAnd then you factor in a rising interest rate environment and it gets to be where you know people just can't afford or they can't get the loans sure of of what they're looking for too so I think it's um this is something that's going to be going on quite a bit and you think you mentioned that softening in certain pockets\nOf the country and you look at all those things and if you've got questions out there and you want help but like I Want to make\nSure that I'm In the rye scenario for myself my family I think you hit on something earlier which I Believe is is that quality of life that work life balance just you know I I I was in that same boat we're originally trilogy was founded\nAnd in Irvine and I live in in a about twelve miles away but it could take me forty five dollars an hour to get home\nAnd I'm like yeah I just don't want to spend my time started to four

I see my industry shrinking ... and what what's my next chapter look like and you can run all those scenarios and help them\nUm understand that hey you can do these things if that's if that's the direction you want to go correct\nAnd the beauty of the the whole coaching process that goes along with it as it were checking in on a quarterly basis to see what's new not only on our side and what we see in the industry or what's going on and\nUh but also what's new on their side how they're feeling we're kind of count on their accountability partner to coach them along said hey ah what what should we be planning for over the coming year it's not just a you know that day we have to really look\nBig picture so you're making sure they're he's doing the course work and now I'm just kidding but I you're falling back into your check it out of answers in but you are making sure that they are progressing because it is a good scenarios hey you can go\nOne year Eighteen months or two years on your income alone and subs you use some savings which chemical five or ten or ... or ...
