I had\n[noise] you're listening to power trading radio [noise] welcome back\nHere to studio ... Jacobson director constructed development is having structure it on my training academy really shed some light on making more income\nIn the market we've been talking a lot of them a lot about generating more income whether its primary income\nWhether it's supplemental income whether it's passive income or whether it's active income and one of the things I always like to boil down in my classes Larry's everybody starts with ... with active income and then eventually moves in a passive income even if you take the wealthiest people in the world right at one point they were working right above it was out there they called a buffet he he was going door to door\nScience doctrine people back in the day even as a kid\nI think I remember reading how he sold bubblegum like on the on the beach at like his family vacations right as active income and right now that the common piece of active income that we all that we all generally have is is our job right we'd go out we have that job\nActively we're working to generate income well now we take a little bit of money and we pay our bills and we put some food in our in our stomach and all of this fun stuff\nRight that we should have a little bit of money left over that goes into our retirement account\nNow that retirement account really ends up being that first wave\nOf passive income money making money right money at work rather than men at work and one of the things that we need to make sure that we're doing is that that account is always heading in the right direction you we've talked a lot on air and author about the situation that the markets and\nWe recognize different selling opportunities we've identified different sailing opportunities we've talked about looking at the down markets as a\nOpportunity rather than a bad thing you know and and here we sit again all time highs breaking highs and we start to have that sell off again and a lot of people are going all man is this the next shoe\nBecause what we've been waiting for for the last few years is everybody's been saying just wait for these interest rates to start climbing and we'll come back to the normal come back to the mean we've started to see the interest rates climb we've even seen some contraction and job growth right it's it's slowing so we're starting to see some of these telltale signs but in the end\nThat does not need to affect anybody's income and that's one of my favorite things about the markets is down markets still generate income\nYeah we teach people to trade like banks I mean ultimately we teach them the core strategy hits are patented simple step by step strategy and really it's easy to learn it's perfect for beginners it's perfect for any account side which grade as you get to learn to trade in live markets and most importantly you can start immediately\nSo when you go in and start taking the opportunity to learn a new skill and become more confident\nThink about it if all this brought you to one really great profitable to trade wouldn't it be worth it\nYeah absolutely and it does take really as far as you look at risk versus reward you come out to the half day class maybe just one good trade over the next month just from the step by step process pays for itself pretty quick especially when you look at the half the class is only about three hours long so really you're investing three hours of your time and\nOne of the things that we always break down on the shows as well talk about you know a lot of people will spend three hours of their time golfing they'll spend three hours their time in a movie\nEspecially if it's avatar right that was at least three hours long right they'll spend three hours of their time on social media we spend three hours of our time watching TV right so I always say you know we're using all twenty four hours a day but are we using them to their full story maximizing the potential because when we talk about our money in the markets\nWe want to maximize our money's potential we want to maximize our time potential as well so maybe we spend a little less time on social media\nAnd we spend a little more time learning how to generate a better income inside of the financial markets one of the ways where we can help somebody really do that Larry we got a second tickets here but we do a little give away let's do it\nAll right well right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area\nThat have take classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really generate more income inside of the market not just more income\nBut consistent income 'cause I don't know about you but I got money going out on a consistent basis I got two kids right is plenty of bills just with those two so we've got to have a consistent and it's all about making money whether the markets are going up down or sideways now just a second you can have a chance to win a set of passes when he's happy classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes as our professional insiders kitten and this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional and Saturday it makes it so you can get started right now\n... tend to twenty we needed a call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nThat's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and top instructor it on I trading\nKetamine really shed some light on retirement accounts were talking about protecting retirement accounts were talking about how to generate more income inside of the retirement accounts\nAnd really how important it is to have still multiple streams of income even as we roll into those retirement years you know building out that stability whether we're twenty or whether we're two hundred and Twenty years old right building out that stability building out that consistent income\nSo that we don't have any question marks in our life and one of the things that we really didn't touch on that last segment may maybe we'll get onto next week is really how many question marks happen the older we get you know it's it's called a surprise because it's something we didn't plan on and there's all all sorts of things that happen\nA as we start going down that talked track in fact it's always interesting to me how when we talk to people who have not retired you put 'em in the same room you put in the people who have not retired and the people who have retired and he asked the people who have not retired\nDo you think you can live off less and they all say yes and then you talk to the people who have retired and you say can you live off left and they go no because there's so many unexpected that come up as we get a little more miles on our body I mean we could just go down the healthcare path that this but there's just so many things that come up that multiple streams income\nEnded up being very very critical ends up being very very important to create that nice stability now whether you're just hurting and maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners are not quite sure they have enough time to really even add\nInvesting into their life you know after all\nThere's only twenty four hours in the day and right now we're using all of them and and the thing I Would like to bring up is Hollywood right there's all sorts of movies that have trading in it there's also the TV shows have investing in it\nAnd they show it let's all encompassing kind of lifestyle when in reality it's not that the average trader doesn't have Eighteen computer monitors the average trader didn't just take their hypertension medication errors traders not sweating profusely right now in fact when you're doing is appropriately your proactively investing\nYour lifestyle can have a lot of freedom in it and that's that's one of the things I I like you to expand on 'cause you you talk with more students than probably anybody I Know you know what are some of the life changing things your seeing\nAnd what are the some of the things people are doing to really get that freedom\nWell the first is taking a step I mean a lot of people are poor for the simple reason poor stands for passing over opportunities repeatedly that people tend to do better in life do so by taking action\nWhen opportunities arise they're not in their comfort zone they're not fearing all the time what they're doing is they're learning a skill that will allow them not only to help themselves maybe their kids their grandkids and again what I find with our students Ryan is they're not from a certain way or education or background\nThere simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier the number one mistake than most people make with their money if they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits\nAnd number two they never do go back to do the education because they've blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptops\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named ... he's in San Diego in a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he just he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow ski saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to this\nHe thought because if I go to Salt Lake I use these bum a pair of skis for them rather than a hall in minor\nAnd of course that's just can't and I'm actually in ... and ... and I want to talk he's a real about something\nVery important if you are ready to change that well we want to have you two hundred college student on the plane to Australia to learn how to be changed in ...\nNot\n...
