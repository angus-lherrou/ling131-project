C. R. as green tea ... and the reason for a liquid soft shell is it's just a superior dosage form especially for these three particular ingredients\nYeah of course before our listeners how they get their very own complementary\nBottle with green T. C. R. Joe me this you wanted to buy this green tea plus the patented B. C. M. Ninety five per human plus the spiritual I mean you spent close to probably least Seventy five dollars ... three bottles and store and yet the purity ... giving away free bottle how are they able to

at the top there\nIt's crucial oil because crew loyal is simply amazing for us it's great for the heart great for the joints fantastic for the brain for the eyes I mean I have people coming into my clinic every single day and they want to feel better I mean they want to feel physically better\nStronger they want their joints to feel comfortable but they want to stay mentally sharp\nThey want to keep that brain thinking like it did when they were younger they want to protect themselves from coronary heart disease and maintain those flexible health a youthful arteries for wonderful circulation hasty they want to boost their energy and you wind not\nI mean we deserve it and that's what we're going to be talking about here today with this cruel omega fifty plus which is the cutting edge\nCombination Steve of crude oil which is so fabulous for us but we infused the crew will notice is so important we've infused with the high omega three concentrated official you need to do that when you're dealing with cruel because cruel just isn't high enough\nAnd omega threes so many other important parameters and virtues but\nYou got to get that high omega three fish are on there and we've done that so this is now the best of both worlds but we didn't stop there for the fifty plus years we've added some vitamin D we doubled the antioxidant power and Steve we actually increase the amount of crow by sixty seven percent so this now becomes the finest omega three nutrient in the world as far as I'm concerned\nThis is very very exciting this cruel oil sensation I mean it is all over the news docked in eleventh grade studies are out there many experts are declaring that Carrillo oil is better than fish oil so give us this low down on this girl omega fifty plus formula\nRight right right the you know if I told you I mean we did talk about this before the show that this is one tiny pill that benefits the joints and the brain and memory mood coronary heart disease wonderful

you\nKnow when it comes to your health they really is a win win this is amazing I heard you say that this can actually reduce the risk of coronary heart disease I mean when you hear that whose ears don't perk up after that how exactly does that work anyway\nRight right well Crowell maker fifty plus remember this is the combination of cruel world with the high omega three highly concentrated they should also which is much higher and omega threes than most cruel oil formulas would be so when we're dealing with the high omega three fish oil we're talking about\nSupport for the HDL cholesterol\nHealthy you pull flexible arteries that's so great for the circulation heart muscle strength platelet activity red blood cells that stay nice and soft and flexible so they're going to work their way through those little capillaries oh what about triglycerides that become so important so\nThis criminal fifty plus supports the heart in so many ways and you know the bottom line is we need to think about this because as we're getting a little older fifty plus maybe mid forties certainly sixties and seventies it's decision time I mean you know your body's not working the way it did when you were in your thirties\nEntertain might not be there you need to make a decision or are you going to take it laying down and just let yourself get old or are you going to do something about it you're going to stay physically active all you're going to do the things you need to stay healthy\nAnd getting these omega threes that crude oil the vitamin D the antioxidants makes such a difference

cardiovascular benefits\nAnd there are certainly also known as brain so now we discuss this in some of the past shows if you would touch on the brain benefits for our listeners listening out there today and tell us why you say that supplementing with omega threes isn't just a good idea for the brain but an absolute necessity\nGo oh this is such an important point that you're bringing up absolutely for brain health we must must get these omega threes back in there you know when you think about omega threes and you think about brain health and memory and mood and feeling sharp you really want to single out the D. H. A. component to that do go\nInto a cast it you know what Steve your brain is sixty percent fat by weight and of that twenty five percent twenty five percent needs to be D. H. hey you know what I use an analogy in my practice people understand calcium and bone health right if you don't have cows human your diet\nAnd you don't supplement with calcium your Bones Are going to get brittle and weak you understand that\nRight right exactly that's what happens to bones bone to need calcium for their normal strength and structure\nNow with the brain and the same the ha for normal structure\nWill use this for one brain or to communicate with another to build out that bring me the serotonin doping mean old feel good neuro transmitters so must must habit must get it back in there so important and what this crew lawmaker fifty plus we've increased the level of th have because we concentrated omega threes and they are now\nWith criminal or fifty plus you got to get a hundred and thirty milligrams of the tree preserving Steve while the leading brand of crude oil you're going to get twenty four\nExcellence twenty four and a leading brand you to get a hundred and thirty with chronic or fifty plus that's why this is so incredible for the brain\nThis is absolutely exciting I got to tell you though during the last real show that we did together you're totally shocked\nMe knocked over civically you tell me around the time I see what I say that\nAnd I remember that the studies show that grill oil improves joint comfort in just seven days now if the benefits of the brain on the hard didn't ... Myers up that certainly would they would touch on this study and tell us how this works\nRight right those are great study in fact that's the reason I started taking crew loyal about five six years ago a pilot study double blind placebo controlled exactly what you want to see out of the journal of the American College of nutrition at participants got three hundred milligrams of crude oil or placebo now remember\nIn Columbia fifty plus we're giving you even more giving you five hundred milligrams of cruel also even more important but\nParticipants in this study that got the crew loyal got some amazing enjoyed benefit Steve get this interest seven days and you remember this from the last show but you're just seven days they were twenty eight percent more comfortable and George drop or when I read that I immediately went out and bought my first bottle\nOf criminal but after thirty days they were thirty eight percent more comfortable the researchers didn't stop there they looked at flexibility of the joints they looked at function of the joints all improvements cold is the crucial oil advantage so if you're out there and you're taking fish oil fish oil is great I mean ... in here it's so important but\nYou're not going to get the same joint advantages just started ... you're not going to experience this joint comfort benefit that we get specifically from the krill and remember incriminate or fifty plus we've jacked up the levels of the krill sixty seven percent more so in terms of dosage fantastic\nThat's big that is absolutely bag I I was on the website and the testimonials on the grill and making fifty plus they're incredible I mean people\nObviously loves this product I like to share a couple of my favorites are sure believer rights and she's a female aged forty five fifty four from Georgia she writes if five out of five stars she writes this has helped less grind on my knees went climbing\nBut the steps beneficial to my overall health both physically and mentally I just feel better is what she said also safety Susan age fifty five sixty four from Sacramento, California\nShe writes to five out of five stars I was a little worried about the safety after taste however I have not convert that even once he goes I like it better than regular fish oil the castle sizes smaller and it's easy to swallow this is big the capitals I think you're young\nAnd I'm really glad you pick that one out because safety Suzanne picks out a very important point there I don't think we really hard on this enough because people have trouble swallowing those huge\nHorse pills you know the usual mega three pills these are tiny so this is why this is such a breakthrough these capsules are so small and easy to swallow anybody can easily swallowed them\nBut at the same time we've increased the dosage of cruel by sixty seven percent we've boosted the antioxidant power the vitamin D is and there was super charge the whole thing with the high omega three highly concentrated fish oil so important for the heart so\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never

A. at it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get\nAny lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it\nAnd to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smoothing skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls have more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose the men do\nAnd you see the skin shoveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking\nAbout ha and they have a new formula just for the joint H A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray\nAll he's doing is measuring the space between the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an inch space without that cushioning\nYou've got bone rubbing on bone that's what age a is it the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief\nThe more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically use pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that what ha is that doctors call it ... fluids\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now\nIt's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's and molecular weight think of\nSix million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at a laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's gotta be knocked down in molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added with that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternative for their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nYou're just tuning in we're talking with Bill ... about ... acid or Eighteen bill you said recently the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nThink the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college\nBut within that college there's moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha\nThe body is Seventy two percent water\nAnd as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells\nThat connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding that the support structure that holds our body together and of course we didn't get into a wrinkle we shrivel up we lose\nAn inch in our height we we see the the brain a shriveled up and the ... and so on all of these things occur with age and you know ... daily on was looking\nFor a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it\nAnd of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello because it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies\nOr even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles the thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried
