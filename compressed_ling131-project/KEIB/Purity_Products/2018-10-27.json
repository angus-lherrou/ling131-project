conducted a study and listen to this they sampled tens of thousands of people checking for impurities in their tissue do you know they\nFound virtually every single person was contaminated with pesticides turbines solvency in chemicals\nSo it's a pervasive issue bottom line it's a toxic world we're living in the big question is\nWhat are you going to do about it but stay tuned Dr Levin has

hundred percent of us in our tissue it's downright scary stuff right\nOh I Hope so literally this is a scary subject and as you mentioned that EPA fact issue survey and that was done on thirty three thousand us residents they found her being plastics chemical solvent in a hundred percent of the samples so basically pat we're all contaminated\nThan the environmental working group act of two thousand six found that tap water in forty two states this time and they did buy more than a hundred and forty on regulated chemicals pat\nThis is the craziest thing of all they do studies of on Bella cord blood they find dozens of chemicals in um ... blood so I mean what are we going to do about this\nWhat are we going to do about this toxic environment the Clintons and detoxify\nOur systems on a

supports all our tissues but on top of that goes to work supporting the liver and its job of cleansing if the talks to find the systems you get the cleansing every single day with O. J. C.\nOn top of that at best news of all today we're giving away a free bottle of OJ seated everybody in the listening audience\nSnap purity isn't saying that they're organic juice twins can fix everything but they are saying that it can be a compelling part of the solution\nIn fact the organic juice clans is one of the hottest products purity is launched probably in the last ten years everybody knows how hot juicing is these days in OJ seat is really organic juicing made simple so tell everybody about the organic juice\nClans and why you call it the quote unquote game changer\nOh yeah absolutely well we know that you sing is sweeping in Asia and we know it's super healthy but the problem is you know it's messy and it's a big hassle it takes a long time by the produce the clean them and that's why I created the organic juice once because it's choosing made simple\nIt's the short but it's the easy way to get more organic fruits and vegetables into your system every single day pat each super size scoop it's got thirty different super food like broccoli spinach kale partially blueberries cranberry strawberries hasta ... berry all certified organic\nIt tastes great it's got a great Barry apple brands flavor and since it's made with real organic produce when your\nStarts to absorb these organic fruits and veggies and berries it makes a huge difference you feel revitalize rejuvenated you feel energy and it doesn't take long past if you're the kind of person it's just getting very few or no fruits and vegetables every day you're probably going to notice the difference the very first day you use it\nAll right now is Dr eleven it's a toxic world out there but when it comes to consuming lots of fruits and vegetables to help the body\nPlans to feel healthy you say don't exacerbate the problem by using fruits and vegetables with pesticides and herbicides now the organic juice ones clearly helps in that department right I mean I'm looking at the label I see organic broccoli spinach\nParsley barley grass wheat grass raspberry strawberries all organic I mean this stuff's sounds first of all delicious and super healthy\nOh right I mean juicing let's face it it's a great idea but I don't like using commercial produce that's Laden with pesticides herbicides and phones I mean I Want to concentrate\nUp the vitamins and minerals antioxidants the fighter nutrients but I certainly don't want to concentrate the pesticides right and that's why I Love this organic juice was because it's er Cannick choosing without the mask\nWithout the hassle it tastes great we're getting the fighter nutrients the antioxidants the vitamins and minerals from thirty organic super food fruits vegetables berries pat in essence we've done the hard work for you we've done the juicing for you the greens inorganic choose Clinton's their farm fresh\nThere the hydrated at low temperatures which locks in all of nature's goodness the vitamins and minerals antioxidants it's all there because this is made from real organic produce\nWe're talking ... first vegetables deep dark Reince blue berries strawberries apples there's green tea carriage cranberries black cards off ... we've done work for your pet and key this is key we've done it at low temperatures blocking all the benefits of these offshore\nOrganic super foods you simply add water shake\nIt up in the ... going to give you today drink it down to taste delicious and then it goes to work helping you\nDr speaking of the organic juice\nThe juice in his sweeping the nation juicing revitalize as it energizes it can help you stay fit and trim in many ways it helps us put back what's missing in so many of our diets as good as the original formula is why I called this new organic juice clans plus formula or made your upgrade why\nWell first of all we beef up the scoop size it's thirty seven percent bigger so now you're getting more of the energy boosting revitalizing cleansing super foods and every scoop we added sixty\nSeven percent more fiber for\nImprove digestion elimination for cleansing detox define it as the blueberries the strawberries we added broccoli milk fissile to help deliver cleansing detoxify the\nSystem there's carrots for the eyes green tea for energy and metabolism cranberries for the urinary tract added ... hail and I'm just scratched the surface here all of these fruits and vegetables and berries specifically chosen for the incredible benefits that\nThey care if you're going to feel better with O. J. C. you're going to notice it rapidly especially if you don't get enough fruits and vegetables\nAnd again everybody in the listening audience today gets a free bottle of are kind of ... plus a free shaker cup and help you mix it up into a delicious Korean smoothie\nNo talk to us about some of the advantages of using O. J. C. versus a regular juice or in terms of the carbs the sugar the fiber in white OJ see not only saves time but it also saves a lot of money\nRight you know I was using a juice or for years and you know what bothered me the most pat the cleanup down that hassle\nIt takes forever you've done it before you know what it's like\nCleaning the produce cleaning the machine after what it is a minimum of twenty minutes and you know what your juicing let's say bananas and grapes that's going to taste good but go start juicing partially the celery kale the broccoli the spinach it's going to be hard to get that down right about the sheer cost of juice in search you got to go out and spend hundreds on a juice or\nAnd then if you're going to go work at it and if you're going to juice are highly recommend that you know expect to spend eighty Ninety bucks a week on juicing\nThat's crazy and another problem with that users you end up throwing away all the fiber and you're concentrating the sugar that's not good\nNo no exactly and that's one of the dirty little secrets of juice or as you know the fact that you're throwing away the fiber and so therefore you're concentrating the sugar you know pat I was in the health food store the other day I grabbed a bottle of blueberry juice a hundred and ten calories pat twenty six grams of sugar\nWhile in Milan serving I grabbed a popular pomegranate juice a hundred and fifty calories and thirty one grams of sugar\nPer serving such crazy and that's because they're removing the fiber in the process that they use their concentrating the sugar what we do ... is the exact opposite\nWhere the hydrate and the greens at low temperatures for maintaining all the goodness of fiber is there the fight and nutrients the antioxidants the vitamins and minerals the plant and sometimes it's all there one serving a purity is organic choose when it was only forty five ... calories and that's because all the fiber is\nStill there remember this is made from real organic produce all we're doing is removing the water at low temperatures locking in all the good and as you can taste it you can taste the organic fruits and vegetables berries you just add water shake it up in the free shaker cup get it into your system and it goes to work helping you\nAll right what about the science behind these certified organic super fruits and vegetables found in the organic juice ... what does the science say about getting seven nine servings of fruits and greens per day how important is that to consume those on a regular basis and what percentage of us really gives enough\nOr look at my patient base I Would say maybe it's one out of twenty seven to nine maybe I'm wrong maybe it's one out of fifty I rarely see it\nAnd the gift tax laws so if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you give anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year\nOkay and uh so that's the gift tax and college in many cases more than fifty thousand dollars a year I Know I have one in college right now and so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak and you know I\n\nWould say\nDog and may be\nFive\n[noise]\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite it's designed to take you from riches to rags\nAnd we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education paying for that okay so as I mentioned the gift tax exemption\nIs Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS [laughter]\nAh almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS\nCame up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon your death and it goes to whoever um and they want it attacks that so they created the estate tax but the IRS is a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax it happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to give it all away first and then when they die there's no tax\nSo we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid so they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we are going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that\nBut they also realized that if you tax every single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with with friends or something that's a gift and so do I have to file a tax\nReturn for that so we get kind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars per person that you can give to\nAnd as a married couple you can give thirty thousand dollars to as many people as us so the gift tax exempt amount that Fifteen thousand as you can get that as many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax\nAnd then by the way if you exceed that Fifteen thousand a gift tax is the same as your state tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay gift taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then have them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have it goes through the child then that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore doesn't count so my advice to you is don't give the child the money now\nI'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college I'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott\nAnd his parents were giving him the money to sensibly pay for the tuition guess what Scott was doing he wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping the money and he used to come down every day and like he had this Chinese ... you know do this",
