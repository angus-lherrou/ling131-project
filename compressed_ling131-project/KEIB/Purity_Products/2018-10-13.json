I was telling people that they don't but they don't play good enough defects and it looked like I mean Utah let's face it they're they're often simply challenged I Know they run the ... the ball decent\nWith with Boston Tyler ... least oh OK quarterback in my opinion I don't think it's anything special um but Arizona's deep and made a made Utah looked like they were you know as they kept pointing out of the game they looked like the ramps I mean it was it was pretty incredible what they were doing but I I think Arizona's pretty bad football team\nOr him what's the update on Washington Oregon right now that said ten ten game eight forty nine to go in the first have Justin Herbert three of eight forty five yards in a touchdown he's also got a carrier for three yards CJ for Dell Thirteen carries fifty three yards for Washington Jake brownies already thrown at picking his games for twelve\nOr forty six yards miles Gaskins eleven carries\nFifty four yards in this one already it as a team they've almost rush for a hundred yards and the first apple already so low scoring game uh right now up in Eugene but a big game as far as the pack twelve is concerned guys because Washington is is the hope right now for the conference\nThis is a national well yeah but what if part of Oregon ... why is in Oregon to hope for the conference they both have one last so I I think whoever wins this game still and it made of Oregon goes on to wet out after winning this game that why wouldn't they still be under consideration\nSo and there are a good football team and Matt I'm gonna let you talk about this you know you forget the defensive coordinator for Oregon I mean Oregon is improved a ton is having a\nOn and the way they play football they're just not throwing it around the place of physical football\nJim Lovell signed up one point seven million dollar contract to be the defensive coordinator\nFor Oregon and that deepens with Tony diet linebacker they're getting it done I mean they know how to put pressure on on quarterbacks and Jake brownie he Fillon are right now and you do is just an urban on the other side of the ball I just think you're right though I mean watching as the only hope that it has a chance to play in a\nCollege playoff game might that lost the Oregon had against Stanford Stanford booth who they're on\nWhy would you do that again that everybody believes that Oregon I mean it was a fluke everything went wrong why would that game knock a pack talk champion out of the playoffs\nWell I Am but you know in that same respect and Tim or the game tonight Colorado us the ... you never know\nWhen it ... see people forget and we start to believe we hear so much that the whole ... shut up if Colorado goes on a goes undefeated and ends up and I'm not saying that's going to happen but they haven't lost yet\nWell why wouldn't they be the playoff it's almost like we even on the west coast start to believe what we're hearing so much on stations like ESPN right because they've already decided that the patch all that good at it but I say bull ... let's see let's see the season play out\nI'm with you but reality is a team on the west coast has to be so over the top dominated has to be good in order to fit into the rest of the college football college football championship it's almost\nLike we're the redhead trial I've haven't why don't we have our power five conference if\nThey want to add the FCC and the ACC just play for their own championship and everybody else's out then then fine you go do that\nThat's the way it is I mean you've got to deserve to the data opportunity and I know it was it was it was one in eight and ball games last last year I Would have nothing to do with this year's play an HMO I got some stats for you in the past twelve right now she's right now the ...\nSecond to last in the pack twelve and rushing when you I Would never thought I'd say that price loves not right here at the game he's not right now\nBut without off into the light of what they've done over the years wouldn't you think they can put I mean think about all the great money back to any of hats that part of that has to do in fact that they block so well or the heart of\nIt has to do what they run a nine men front right have\nCage it could still be here's another one to Washington state third of the pack twelve and total defense only given up three hundred Thirteen Years how did they lose their defense recorded at Ohio State\nAlex courage and he's not really a deepest according or ... or ... runs a direction yeah so that's a that's what we're waiting and waiting and I have the office of a ... player of the mid year right now ... gets to the other guy as an officer defund off in\nA market that me on this too I'm sure mark Jefferson, Oregon state never heard of mark Jefferson, Oregon state well touch down a hundred and forty four yards again yeah never heard of that\nFor you to blow your mind Matt Stevens Colorado USC oh and twelve and had to end meeting\nYou're going to win today are you doing today Colorado\nSteven Sebring ... are are going to show the coaches what where where they're at\nAnd there are other little balance out of Trayvon McMillan ... amount of weight and I think it's just a really\nGood defense and you know ... he's going to be tested the true freshman sometimes eyeballs as wide receivers uh but that is at home in Colorado has never beating them and\nI don't know what what do you think it is you know guys ever since we're on this you know yes he's plenty of quarterback to all kinds of talent right they're receiving corps really really good but it's just like there there's something there's something missing you know as he just doesn't seem like a C SPAN of Bradford well\nYeah Ronald Jones [laughter] no no I don't even look at the receiving corps for per se that's not their problem Sandra I mean Sam Donaldson though that's not their problem in our own good I just feel like they're not as good at the other things are not nearly as dominant on defense I'm with\nYou know be smart when you throw the ball if you're going to mess mess where nobody else is you don't have to force anything\n... that's what they they I'm sure worked on this week so I think you're going to see a smarter a quarterback for Cal but for UCLA this guy can run I mean if you watch some of the runs up the middle his explosive and he will run past you if you're not careful\nYeah he can run but make them a thriller because that's what UCLA has to do defensively and you know a quarter backs a runner and he's going to take off I mean you can prepare your defense make no doubt about it Jerry as narrow has a scheme and make him make throws down field so I think that's going to plan to UCLA advantage and like I said I mean the guy has\nFive interception in the last couple of games I mean that is not good\nYou know it's funny too when you think back to the mobile quarterback so we talked to ... you talked about this a lot UCLA has not been great quarterbacks I think back to that Oklahoma game\nThe difference in this case is when you give collar Murray a ton of time to just stand back and pro he's a really good passer ... so he can do that I think if you can keep that going in the pocket and force him to talk about the outfield\nUm you know I have a feeling these you know the secondary this year especially players like Nate matters is felt like you know what I I have a feeling he's got to come out and make some place in this game I I think he's probably pretty frustrated with the way the seasons gone so far and if you can force Mac awaiting is a tough throes I think the diesel makes them play yeah as\nFar as the guy he's thrown into it don't nobody really sticks out is like a huge threat\nFor UCLA to be worried about it's almost like Patrick Laird is a guy who is a dual threat is well he's got anyone carries for three hundred yards two touchdowns but you've also got twenty three catch just raw hundred and twenty five yards so I get off and simply the quarterback gets a lot of the work you're ... gets a lot of touches either catching running the ball but\nIt doesn't seem like there's a a huge threat down field with this wide receiver grew\nYeah well I mean they weren't in pretty good and so it's kind of I Know they just don't have a capable quarterback like Ross Bowers who started last year through for over three thousand yards and Eighteen touchdowns throwing the ball to him so it's just it's a different type of\nAnimal a quarterback and you've got an offensive line all five returning starter some last year's team they're very experienced that run of the football but I think Justin Wilcox beat her demons of mine\nHe's taken it I'm going to control this game I'm going to control the clock we're going to run the ball we're going to play a good defense I'm going to shorten the game a little bit at a out of a David shots playbook and camper\nPlayer that might have been able to help this a cow office be a little bit more explosive is that guy's plan for Texas right now trying to get out of centennial he was here if you tune into a Texas game you play in running back and doing great things for them so they don't seem as athletic idols ... I like watching them play\nBut they don't seem like the explosive players got probably come from their quarterback\nYeah defensively cow\nThird against the past six against the run of the pact well Matt you mentioned it earlier they lead the pack twelve in turnovers eight interceptions this year already and they have a tackling machine and their junior Evan Weaver\nEvan Weaver and also join in ... ah those two guys have a third of the team tackles on defense very active linebackers and they're big dues to thirty five to forty five at very experience secondary Ashton\nGave us a safety he's all over the field and a Josh a are jailing Hawkins a three interceptions so they're very back in heavy very backing good at the defense of front the defense of line of cow that's a little bit challenge\nYou know and this is what's great I mean UCLA just went up against a stout\nGive us a lot of the Washington Huskies and did very very well\nSo I I'm I'm just saying that I I I'm feeling something I I feel in some sort of momentum there's something inside right now that just makes me feel like this is going to be an office of game there's just going to build on what we saw last week I think they're going to take advantage of what just ... just said\nAnd be able to run the ball and when you're able to run the ball other things are going to open up\nWhat are you guys make all adjusted Wilcox is done in a short time there is head coach he's he's certainly surrounded himself with some really good coordinators up Peter sermon associate head coaches got tons of experience Tim to ruder or who is a guy who was the head coach of Fresno state or both Baldwin who he ... he grabbed as well I mean this is a good coaches that\nAdjusted Wilcox but together is he getting this program going to back it back in the right direction at Cal\nI think they can be but I think the fact that this team looking at their schedules going to have a really hard time people eligible it's hard to build momentum when you keep winning you know five games a year I I think this is a crucial stretch priority pointed out their schedule is coming down the stretch\nYou know players nowadays they want to go where where winnings happening and so when you you know we have high hopes and start the season off three you know making it at the top twenty five but then you can't lose much came down the stretch and he may not happen but for what you know it seems like they're going to lose a lot more than they went coming down the stretch\nRecruiting it's so important in that Justin Wilcox he inherited a team from sunny dikes that didn't even care about defense I mean they don't even know what defense was that sunny dyke sunny dykes play the game where first one is sixty wins the game\nAnd it was more basketball deal so it's going to take you know two three four years for Justin Wilcox they get the right personnel in on defense and they're going to look to run the ball be a little more conservative\nOn off it's All right we'll take a break we'll come back we'll get the keys to the game for Matt and Wayne as we lead you to Berlin Game day at two thirty countdown to kick off continued UCLA all five on the seas are looking for that first when\nUnder chip Kelly good income today they're on the road in Berkeley in a packed to um showdown against the cow golden bears how comes in three and two on the season but a golden opportunity for UCLA to get the win UCLA count kickoffs at four o'clock down a kickoff continues you're unable to fifty [noise]\n\n... be Los Angeles says to the Patriot am eleven fifty broadcasting throughout the south land and all over the world I heart radio [noise]\nAnd now the top flight reasons to visit my run the casino resort in small this week number ... ... what do you mean I guess what my singular in here and I'm only\nGoing to do one reason to go to\nSmoke in good times that's happening Sunday October fourteen\nYou'll get three Greeks are going to increase the\nRomeo and Juliet ... and the aging room after five years of\nA dream premiums an amazing\nFor I mean one of the first three hundred people and get a limited edition\nOh this is a lot of times there is a form of Latin jazz great punch awesome to get your ticket now lift ticket master dot com\nThe box office making light of it to recruit\n... casino resort\nGrounds smoke in good times Sunday October fourteenth only run the casino resort spa\nTimes [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nA kind of having to do all day long\nTerm\n\nFor\nTheir own\nTown\nAlso accepting boats motorcycles RVs in real estate donations\nIt's game time what do you want for game ... that's the key in a time as well right making ... world class\nTequila from certified organic blue Weber ... triple distilled baby costs like kind of ...
