women older women to this is a big study it down and women but then again eight years later and the women were on average Seventy eight years old at this point they did MRI scans of the women's

and friends and Dr oz Chris welcome back to the show\nThank you so much pat it's always a pleasure to have a great conversation with you\nNow most of us are super busy these days we want to stay healthy but quite frankly it could be done you\nKnow with all the different supplements out there not Chris you've traveled all over the world learning about different natural remedies so you really know which ingredients to look for so tell me this besides a good multi vitamin insufficient well maybe a few other things go into the three super high nutrients you've been so jazzed about lately\nWell I'm happy to do that pat the three super nutrients as we like to say are a groom the extract a tumor Rick extract called Kirk Yemen and an extract from red wine called ... they're a troll and apropos of what you said about my traveling around the world I've extensively\nInvestigated the is in their host countries so I've been in the green tea plantations of China and India and worked with top researchers of this ingredient in those countries\nWith tumor ... I've been deeply involved with to emerge researchers in India and seeing all of that and with Reza there a trial I've worked with scientists in Europe and also in California in ... in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing\nAreas I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientists than my conclusion is that ...\nIn the Kirk human for him to recruit and ... ... from red wine are remarkable health and Hansing agents that everybody can benefit from in the very very substantial way\nYeah Christmas is talking about these big three and it's interesting that they're found in our diet and all are considered super food the green tea human humans spiritual why did you want to combine just read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other worse when you go in a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to\nPut them all in separate products they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kinda like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce\nOr a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems so they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this\nIs really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting raspberry trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nLet's dive into the headlines and the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know in Asia and they've been using for thousands of years for healthy Egypt but what are you seeing recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti oxygen activity in whole blood unify on to recap some of these headlines you show me while you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume but don't actually\nWind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among\nThe most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed they improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is you get this great concentration of antioxidants\nSubstances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the\nCells of your body your organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants some things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants\nOur bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called glue to ... so you're taking the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to ... so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplementing gradients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nLet's switch gears and talk about this for human which is number two on your list by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea humble\nFormula review offering free bought on a few minutes we'll talk to me about the human would you smelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it but scientists and researchers know it's one of the most powerful supersedes on the planet\nYou can positively influence our DNA maintain joint comfort healthy inflammation in more you share some of the credible headlines on human and tell us why you use this we talked about this on a few minutes ago just patented B. C. M. Ninety\nFive formula of course human which seven times ...\nOkay well first of all I think well people might not know that term Kirk him and they may well no ... group which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and\nIt's part of the five thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying ... and its derivative ... since the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I'll say this right off the bat that they are almost no plant materials in the world as extensively studied is this\nA couple of thousand studies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is powerfully antioxidant we know that it has a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon\nIt greatly enhances joined health so people are experiencing joint this comfort due to overuse\nThis really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective it helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol\nAnd one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that cook human actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nIt causes your body to produce these\nAgents in the brain that protect the\nActual issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times the absorption of any other Kirk human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion\nIs one of the most life and Hansing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I Know that we turned over to you by the green tea in human in your new green she she are liquid ... formula which purity is given away for free today first\nTell me about the third nutrient on the list the rich ... which is super hot right now here with some of the headlines the science behind her spiritual I notes from red wine and French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nRivera trial is one of those remarkable ... pounds that I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does\nIt is found in grapes in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant\nBut more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation\nIn tissue and insulin insensitivity ... helps to protect against those things it's a powerful immune regulator and you know our immune system is responsible\nFor keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial\nFor the heart and this is why it's considered one of the keys to the so called French paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but ... appears to be\nKey in that and additionally\nThere is a brain benefit like there is with the current cumin\nWith blood flow to the brain so when you take ... you get rain blood flow\nThis means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused so this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that would just", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "20"}
