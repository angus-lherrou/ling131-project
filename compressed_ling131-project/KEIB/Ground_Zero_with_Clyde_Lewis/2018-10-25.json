that we are the last defense against an invasion force an invasion force should echo from here to the border and\nTo the heavens so there's that or this brand rather should I go from here to the heavens cheers a mud Matthew I'm I ... well\nThe ... the point is that the border patrol has to tell people not to come into the country illegally uh but what I Will tell you and many others won't is that they're they're abusing the process\nRight now by their not technically illegals and I we all need to understand is if they show up at a port of entry and they're from Honduras and they claim that they are incredible fear of their lives uh there was you know whatever the specific verbiage is that they're all using because they've been told this is what they should say\nThey're not technically at that point illegals they will become illegals when they were led into the interior of the United states and they do not show up for their hearings or or if they're at their hearings they are\nTold that they must leave the country and they don't\nBut it's important we get all this right or they're not technically illegals if they show up at a port of entry or even if they claim defensive asylum asylum laws are very deep I shouldn't say that laws asylum process is very favorable to anyone who shows up in the United\nStates and and claims that they have an asylum case so we gotta gotta remember that\nUh she Jay writes a book about these bomb packages I Know it's too early to tell the monies that it was the Russians they know both sides blame each other and therefore thereby resulting in more political chaos similar to how Russia is paid for political ads on both sides and the twenty sixteen election and promote disdain\nTJ my friend I I Can't tell you if you're right or wrong on this one I all I can tell you is\nThat um you know we don't know like we really just have no idea um be the way that we don't know who's behind this we know that it's a it's a terrorist act and\nThat's kind of where I Believe it for now I I don't you know this speculation at some point can lead you down a road of well let's just say that once it turns into more wild guess territory\nReally not helping yourself or anybody else out so I'm trying to I'm trying to withhold my father's and how you guys know that ... ... when they're tough call that I feel strongly about them I'll make it\nRight away and and I knew right away that it was of the fix was in against Kavanaugh and that that was all hit that was a an ambush\nUm but you know that that\nThis one I just can't tell you that I have enough of a enough of a sense of what's going on to to go to deep into it I'm just telling the truth the\nGas is there a part of the things that if you were trying to create a lot of sympathy for the Democrats are and for the last right before an election that this sure that everyone is thinking that in the back of their minds but that's not enough to say well that's what I really believe that's what the evidence leads me to believe is happening that's a different thing\nAries right a brilliant analysis as it concerns the media's propaganda toward Trump\nThey'll ... simultaneous they say ... a Trump is in students pocket while saying he will start a nuclear arms raised with Russia maybe they're flipping out over Trump's handling of the show the incident try to create the narrative the Trump is in a K essays pocket\nBecause the king of Saudi Arabia because of the narrative him being Russia's pocket isn't working out so well funny how you call the situation with case and turkey like a scene out of the Sopranos I thought the best way to handle it it was like a scene Sopranos especially with these characters\nMax Boot is a disgrace I have a few of his books I won't be buying any more\nBy the way speaking a jackass is did you see Don Lemon reading the ten commandments with Max Boot on air and how Trump is violated\nThem uh men\nThere you go aries thanks right in man I always know that\nWhen I when I get ... areas as part of that is for that team but\nCrew when when they write in telling me I'm doing good on something I Know I'm really really do an excellent stuff you're doing really good work 'cause if I'm if I'm mailing it in a little bit which I never do that if I'm just not you know if I'm not a hidden triples and I'm just getting on first base where with some\nPart of the show I'll hear about it I'll hear about it uh so I appreciate that area's thank you for writing and I'm\nHaving to read the book I Can't believe you haven't mentioned the assassination of general ... an attempted assassination of general ... in Afghanistan last week there are a lot of us veterans who depend on you to help the country remember there were still fighting Afghanistan\nYou spent a lot of time talking about the show the but not on ... what's up with that I'm giving you a partial pass because the midterms but I just um but just you know I'm disappointed oh as as Tabitha Tabitha you're\nYou're right you're right and it it it's not a wasn't a a\nConscious choice I just got caught up in the news cycle you know day to day out like everybody else that's that's trying to put together a Daily Show and a and I I uh I missed the I missed the boat on this one um yes there was an attempted assassination of a U.S brigadier general in Afghanistan insider threat\nTaliban infiltration this keeps happening and uh and and they got a general a rustic and Afghan general and you know now they're going after senior military a very very senior military officers and we can't protect her very senior military officers the masters of that sends all the way down\nThe uh the chain of command is no one safe anywhere in Afghanistan now that that's the message\nAnd it just goes to show you that uh we are not look we're not winning the war in Afghanistan my friends and we're not holding the line either in Afghanistan we're losing our area control is receding\nAnd we think that because we don't have that many of our soldiers doing frontline patrols every day that they're not\nQuite in the same you know they're they're not really in harm's way quite the way they'd be at other stages of this war but there's still a threat and if things go really badly then it's gonna be all hands on deck so to speak and that means our men and women are going to be the ones that have to keep ... from falling\nSo a tablet thank you for the reminder I did read about that story and had done some research on it I I have also reached out just a you know to a
