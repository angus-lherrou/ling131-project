America without a conspiracy in the background trying to bring it down\nWe would be just coming out of the honeymoon with President Trump\nYou know there's ... there is a honeymoon right there was a honeymoon for Obama there's a honeymoon for Bush\nAnd usually I talk about the hunting and I said yeah the honeymoon will be great you know we have a great time with President you know everything's cool everything's great\nAnd then of course we started hating them after a few years so it's the way it's supposed to be but no we hate him now we have any of them from the beginning we hate him and you know maybe it'll turn maybe eventually you'll do something while loving everybody in the country of Donald Trump as a savior he's ... he's got he's wonderful\nWho knows I I just don't see how this is going to go anywhere but bad because like I said I'm I mean last night I think it was pretty evident\nThat I really needed to escape the reality of discord not only in my country but in my state here in Portland, Oregon where I live It's MORNING I woke up thinking about the speech the President Nixon gave it is not a member a he it was back in sixty nine\nI'm Nixon was speaking and he said mankind how'd he said he said some mankind was reaching what magnificent precision for the moon but falling into Iraq is just court on her small a shocking to me um\nAid he basically said that it was really unfortunate that we're living in times where\nAre we reached the magnificent precision of going to the moon reaching out to what is above us but we fall into discord here on earth\nWe tend to fight here on earth but we're trying to go out and dismay and I thought about that for a minute I thought that you know here we are\nGetting all kinds of messages from the guys I mean technological\nNotes tech you know these these these things are looking for the ... there were Nineteen more fast radio birth last night if you don't that Nineteen\nFast radio birth that they collected in Australia that I mean they just going up and up and up and up and up\nAnd these are like flashing and they're like going what they came right out and said and the guardian I was reading the guardian read another newspaper besides the guardian\nSays something like alien fast radio burst now they're calling alien fast radio birds are we talking about them in the United states no no no no no is other ah I'd rather read news organizations outside the United states as they're talking about it\nAre we talking about it he has we did last night we talked about it\n\nWe're getting all kinds of messages from this guy's techno signatures beeps are getting all kinds of lights signals from what can be alien life alien civilizations and yet we are now in the throes of a civility crisis that could lead to a war footing between dividing factions across ideological lines in this country\n\nWe're not even taking the time to look up we're too busy looking down we're too busy looking right in front of our feet and thinking\n[noise] I hate I hate that I hate I hate I hate everything you're saying I hate it I said it's what we got going on right now about hate all the anger you know\nWe all know what they're against but do we know therefore no we don't because that's how we are now in America we know what we don't like but we're not talking enough about what we do\nLike I like aliens\nI like the fact that they're fighting these wonder is things in space right now but what I Do like what I hate is they're not talking about it enough on the news now they're not\n\nMean fact the truth about what is out there\nAnd the seriousness ... the ... of what is coming sounds even more outrageous\nBecause the corporate media will not touch these stories and so we're experiencing a sort of self imposed cover up based on political interest in division\n\nYou want to know what's hard I'll tell you what's artsy for the past week gang he I mean every once in a while this happens into it but it's happening a lot more now for the past week\nI subscribe to a lot of cooking services and I also you know got all the fourteen Web sites and they go to websites with a lot

sucks gay\nMost clipping services a news outlets to provide inspiration for many of the topics on my program have now been brought to the forefront and the topic of conspiracy\nOkay not a theory not conspiracy theory\nNot a theory of conspiracy or a hypothesis but conspiracy\n\nOkay now I Hope I'm not confusing because conspiracy theory is a theory about a conspiracy meaning there is a there are groups that are conspiring to make something happen or the conspiring to cover up something okay that's the theory you have no proof\nYou have a circumstantial evidence of the theory but you don't have proof\nBut see this is a conspiracy theory I'm Talking about it's it's a bona fide\nProven conspiracy being put forward by the world's leaders and of course our leaders\nWho have now decided that a lack of civility is the option for getting what they want\nAnd that is control of the country\n\nWe are witnessing the collaborative process organized by conspirators to solidify a coordinated active insurrection in order to meet\nA political goal\nAmerica's politicians of both parties want to use the power of government to silence\nTheir enemies to silence their photos [noise] some of the
