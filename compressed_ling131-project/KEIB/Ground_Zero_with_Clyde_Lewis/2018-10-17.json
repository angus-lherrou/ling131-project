now as a nation because many people\nAre getting MRSA another problems a flesh eating disorders\nBut a warning went out\nAbout this increase in a ... a a ... it's a cute ... ah blasted my light is\nThis has been a significant increase since twenty Seventeen\nInto worrying perpetuation of a disease which there is little understanding they don't know where it's coming from the why it's happening\nAll the cases that were announced sixty two have been confirmed it twenty two states\nA surge has battled help officials who announced a change in the way the agency is counting cases but he also wanted to raise awareness about the conditions for the parents can seek medical care if their child develop symptoms and fill positions can quickly relate reports of the potential illness\nCDC\nThe increase in cases are starting happening in twenty fourteen the CDC was tracking this\nBut every year since then usually in August or September the CDC is logging a spike of it a spike in this ... virus but it it's a ... the ... the spikes are significantly high right now\nI'm back in twenty Seventeen CDs as he reported that a child died from this disorder instance officials have been able to or they haven't been able to determine how the disease spreads\nThey're starting to count suspected cases as well as confirmed too bitter anticipate increases over the coming months so uh I can tell you know it's too early\nTo know whether the total of twenty team will surpass those the previous years but the data is showing a substantially larger number than in previous months this year\nSo\nAnd and the bad thing is is there is no treatment for it\nLong term outcomes aircraft shoot\nAnd what happens is what evidence is you know we were talking about things like eat clients that the lightest we're talking about all these other disorders that are certainly affect the brain and the nervous system this affects the nervous system\nEspecially with a specifically the spinal cord neurological conditions like you'd have a variety of causes such as viruses environmental toxins in genetic disorders among the cases under investigation\nAre basically there are five reported to the Maryland health officials in recent weeks a health department spokesman said that Maryland's first cases reported September twenty first known cases have been reported Virginia or the district this year\nBut there were three confirmed cases in Virginia and twenty sixteen and that's what health department officials have set\n\nNow we know that medical science is continually making rapid advances we've got new medications treatments all these things are developed\nAnd they're introducing a rapid pace our with supply and demand I often come to play the possibility\nThat pharmaceutical companies can cut corners and they get very sloppy\n\nNow we're always a short to it by the FDA or buy health organizations that our system for screening\nUh is superior than most are are drug screening as superior than most are vaccine screenings are superior than most\nBut now can be argued that I after Jay consequences they're not necessarily the problem with a doctor but it may just be the fall of the manufacture of these medications or\nWhatever it is re introduced into the system we're looking at a toxic environment of drugs are toxic environment vaccines kids are reactive them in various ways I don't think the CDC or the FDR anyone would come forward and say that perhaps a vaccine caused this\nOr some other drug I mean we know\nOur biological systems are constantly evolving\nAnd if we go by scientific hypothesis we also surmise that disease causing organisms are evolving too\n\nAnd so this raises a lot of questions and a lot of eyebrows about whether or not treatments in pills they kill the ills are killing the patient or in this case\nCourting and Tara viruses that cannot be altered\nAnd like I you know we look at biological systems all biological systems ... disease causing organisms and and of course the victims of people they all they they evolve and they adapt sometimes they evolve and adapt or\nCertain diseases don't bother them anymore they run its course it's kind of like a virus that runs its course it doesn't it go dormant for a while and that comes back with a vengeance but right now we need to start understanding the evolution of what is happening and how can make a big difference\nIn how we treat disease\nI mean the evolution of disease causing organisms they outpaced our ability to invent new treatments and it may even pay sorry Billy to ease pain and suffering\n\nAnd I can tell you that it it appears\nThe failures of the passive given wait for the most unexpected successes and some of those unexpected rises or rate raising him disease and biologically altered diseases as well\n\nNew problems of course in ... and this new paralyzing disease is harming our children and we know the accidents related to carry a medication in particular multiplied\n\nAnd we begin to worry about health care and health care professional we we hear about drug induced I after Jenike artifacts\n\nWe hear about adverse effects or even adverse drug events we hear about adverse effects from vaccines and the minute you bring this up somebody says oh I didn't know you were the anti vaccine when they start ridiculing you\n\nBut just think about all the accidents that all the mistakes that have been made\nWhen the pharmaceutical companies don't evolved with people and don't have all the ... would be a diseases that are coming on board now either we can say that this is all being plan\n\nWe can say that it's all being done for the call the aspects and for the for the eliminating or the ... but\n\nYou're not helpless to fight it you're not helpless to stop it you're not helpless to a new new things to make yourself better\n\nAnd and so we have available many things\nThat they can put us uh in in a situation where we can build our immune systems we can build a bill all sorts of things that we just know the right things to eat the right things to do is write supplements that take the right drugs I mean\nI I worry now because uh I've heard before\nWe were hearing about the the biological weapons we're hearing about the biological attacks we were hearing about\nMosquitoes actually infecting people and giving them you know equine and several light is or giving them some sort of ah eastern equine suffer white as for some other a disease that affects\nThe spinal cord with a brain or hemorrhaging or what have you and I don't think anybody is is pushing the pandemic button yet\nAlthough we are right now\nAt the doorstep of the new flu season and I would hate to think that the virus would attack a child and give them an\n... virus a polio and non polio virus to paralyze them\n\nAnd so a word of warning that it just seems to me the diseases are evolving\nNow whether we're giving them the point where whether or not we're giving them the push is another story whether or not environment is giving them to push is another story whether or not\nDrugs or after Jenike artifacts or things of that nature pushing it but it just seems to be more and more ... these cases seem to happen more and more in the flue last year killed eighty thousand people eighty thousand people [noise]\nIt was because of an ineffective vaccine and a lot of people who took the vaccine or gotten the vaccine were the ones who saw the flu evolved into a very deadly form of pneumonia [noise]\nKilled eighty thousand people last year that is a lot of people to be having die from simple flew [noise]\nAnd I worry about these children that are getting these polio viruses but he's totally alike attacks\nAnd the CDC and the FDA and all these other groups don't understand how they can treated or get rid of it [noise]\nIt's once again a history of evolved pathogens evolve viruses evolve diseases that we have not evolved [noise]\nGone and so there are a lot of [noise]\nThere's a lot of a worry and suspicion about what is happening [noise] tripling six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis\nUlysses ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nSomething that most certainly you wouldn't want your children to go through\nDribbling fix every three thirty seven hundred extra believe six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nAre we watching the evolution of diseases\nAnd is the pharmaceutical companies are are the pharmaceutical companies evolving with those diseases\nI don't believe they are\nI think that they are at a loss for a lot of things eighty thousand people dead from the flu last year I think is proof of that Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six Seventy three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n\nFifty\nFox News I'm Carmen robbers President Trump's upset

something\n\n\n[laughter] not as [noise]\nWell my wife\nWife I laughed\nShot here because we're off\n\nBest\nFriends are real leverage\nTo drink plenty of\nVaccine I'm quite\nLewis you are listening to ground zero that it was called and I believe six seven three thirty seven hundred the pharmaceutical companies are not\nKeeping up with the evolution of diseases and they're not keeping up with pain and how pain is evolving as well so what they've done is their teaming up with advertising agencies they're grading public service announcements and they're and they're basically\nPushing certain attitudes ideas about vaccines and drugs now selling that you you know he is trying to outsell\nTrying to sell your ability to heal yourself and the reason why is because I think as we speculated last year ... bio labs have greeted these new superbug superbug super diseases that evolved into something else we have a respiratory viruses down turning into an in terrible virus\nWe have a flu virus that turns into a pneumonia that kills people\nOkay\nAnd so everyone working in the pharmaceutical industry cannot help but notice that it's undergoing a vigorous evolution we're going to an evolutionary period that only for help but for the pharmaceutical companies\nAnd much has been written about how you do pharmaceutical companies will need to change and how they are offering the public or\nIneffective drugs ineffective vaccines ineffective ineffective I after Jenike artifacts basically with the cure kills you know CBO affects instead of placebo would you do see boats no benefit at all\nAnd show which is why I I think it's important we should talk about this\nWe should bring this up because I I think the word of warning should go out\n\nAnd if you have you ever have you have a compromised immune system I Would say use your judgment and and and perhaps use your better judgment maybe get a flu vaccine I I'm not sure I don't think of ... vaccine is for everyone but after what I read about what happened last year and how people who've gotten the flu vaccine eventually\nHad floated evolved into something else\nI'd be really really really suspicious of this because you can't sue the pharmaceutical company\nBrock Obama put that the law says Baxter International course was one of his major contributors and back to international courts makes the flu vaccine several other vaccines that of course we're being pimped in pushed on the American people for the longest time\n\nNow here we are with everything they tell us get your vaccine get ... get ... get busy and nothing's working\n... none of our children are now getting and Tara viruses non polio internal viruses were they first start out as a respiratory illness and then they're paralyzed same thing with ... as you start getting assuming of sick this isn't your paralyzed who to gain a function exercises where people are getting rice in sent to them\nWhere they end up getting sick and and they end up uh you know it's like\nWe're in the middle of this right now we don't even realize it's happening but the CDC says well this is happy we don't know what to do but will tell you about to watch your kids to make sure they don't take up the symptoms and get them in all by the way the way to prevent it put on something put on some sort of a mosquito repellent so they don't get bitten by mosquitoes\nBetcha\nSpeak volumes to everybody shouldn't it especially when we talked about this before and how it's being done\n\nThe mainstream not going to report this to you they're just not\nMean they'll report it probably eventually production reported like were reporting it\nAnd they haven't been following it says we've been following the ... exercise from the beginning to what has been happening slowly but surely the gain a function of exercise eat everybody sick or to get a certain group of people sick and the idea that using DNA from these twenty three and me and ancestry to sell to places by GlaxoSmithKline Pfizer\nSo they can use DNA to basically zero in on certain DNA types of diseases", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles",
