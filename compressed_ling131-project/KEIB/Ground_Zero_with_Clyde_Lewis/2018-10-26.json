pre position all the materials necessary to build a tent city I mean living quarters shower facilities messed facilities port a potties\nFood water betting clothing everything\nHave the grounds all staked out and ready for construction and bring in Sheriff Joe to supervise the whole thing along with all this we should bring in ten or twenty functional FEMA trailers\nThat can be used as temporary courtrooms that have all the judges already there to adjudicate any claims and all of for sanctuary status right there none of this come back we're three and three or four years for hearing bull crap out early you know you're you're actually\nMuch more solution oriented than a lot of other people who think they are on this issue because the problem is not that\nWe don't have enough people to catch people at the border from this caravan the problem is that they will turn themselves in and claim false asylum that's what they will do right so it's not decision oh we need more people to catch them\nI don't think I don't think everybody really really get that part of this\nYes they may be initially prosecuted for illegal entry if they don't show at a port of entry if they just try to cross the border but think about the the value proposition from their side\nIf you get close to the U.S Mexico border and you're a Honduran as part of this caravan you can either just tried to sneak in the United states free and clear or if you get caught then you say oh well I'm claiming asylum defensive asylum is what they call it I'm I'm I needed a song and you will still get process for the illegal entry but that's a misdemeanor\nAnd they're not going to deport you for that and so you've had your asylum hearing\nSo you really get two shots to stay in the U.S under the system as it is now and we do need much speedier process uh but keep in mind how do you even hear these ... properly\nThey're not providing any ... any specific documentation of a threat against him they just tell a story and the question is is their story compelling\nSo ... you're you're at least thinking about this and the right way which is that if we had a\nA a set up at the border where it was essentially you know when they have the a producer Mike knows about this they got the uh courthouse under the the eagles the eagles play you know the football stadium they have a courthouse in the stadium for all the drunken brawl so their take you write down there and you know\nYou get justice dispense right away you get your fine or you go to jail or whatever so it it sort of like that at the border would be what are what you can do so or when you're\nYou're on the right track my friend Bryan writes box still laughing out loud about trying to mediate discussion on the heated topic between crystal in

mean she you know you can come at her with with everything you've got and I'll tell you look crystal from the left is also very tenacious so it was quite as I can tell a lot of you that does all this that it was quite a thing\nIt was quite a thing that ah that happens or by the way there's a rumor that junk weaker from the young church maybe there tomorrow and while I'm not planning to be in any
