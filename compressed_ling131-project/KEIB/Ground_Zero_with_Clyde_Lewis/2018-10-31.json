situation on the southern border uh I think that one would probably go too far even for Trump though that's my sense of a thank you so much reading and my friend made dean rides and but I Know I Know he was kidding I Know who's getting I just I didn't want to step on the man's thought process seas so I moved\nTo the next roll call Maria\nRight does it make you wonder where all the anti gun folks are after the synagogue shooting they usually don't miss an opportunity to spin that narrative while Maria they are already out\nSpinning a narrative perhaps not quite as clearly as they have whereas a in full throated a fashion that they have in the past I think that's mostly because\nThe anti gun anti Second Amendment left knows enough to know the right now there are Democrats who are in some tight races in states where gun rights are very much a supported by folks who vote and so they don't want to create more problems the Democrats\nThe party right now that's the only reason I think your honestly not seeing more shrew a anti gun commentary in the media and while you're not seeing more people running around protesting and all that kinda stuff\n... right I'm a proud member of team buck Israel thanks for unwavering support for Jewish people everywhere filling the low ... love is real so I'm Glad you're feeling it thank you very much for writing in from teen book Israel and please spread the word\nTo your Israeli brothers and sisters that we would love to have more and more of them listening in on the podcast joining in on the free to much ah aries my buddy Roger bought this weekend the leftist media including fake tapper\nHave proven their either agenda driven subversive bent on tearing the country apart for their own purposes or completely stupid and insane\nThere is no simple misunderstanding of difference of opinion on this point\nBy calling Trump's nationalistic rhetoric anti Semitic they're literally feeding into and agreeing with the talking points of anti Semitic groups like the Nazis the nation of Islam and ... who say Jews cannot be loyal to their country et cetera et cetera or the other media it's been a horrific on this aries\nAnd a tap or has embarrassed himself insofar as he spent so much time creating this oh I'm such a serious newsman brand I have no bias or a legion he's a nasty snide little fellow\nAnd does a lot of stuff in public that is meant for public consumption but I can tell you that are behind the scenes not a nice guy not a good guy and that's all you really need to know\nUh and it's made a joke of his whole show I mean he had somebody on saying that ISIS has not radicalize as many people as Trump and let it go didn't immediately say well well you can say that on here so that's all you really need to know about some of these books John\n... book I've been following all the quote justified violence from the left I Know how to beat it\nAh the anti ... and be all end folks are just paid thugs they don't really want to fight they just want Republicans to fight back to defend themselves\nSo the left can point the finger at the right and say see they're they're violent fascist they're willing to be bloody than be up for it\nThe real way to beat this has to follow the money why can't people with the right skill sets infiltrate these groups at a high level and expose the leaders and expose the money uh John falling the money is very important that's why we had our friend\nRocky custom on yesterday to talk about who is trying to fund\nThese are the fund the caravan organized the caravan there are definitely people were ... they are definitely people that are putting money into\nThis just a question of finding out who they are so I got to find the money and we're certainly looking into it willy right\nSeems like everybody forgot how the media were searching for a Tea Party member\nCalled James Holmes after the Colorado shooting yes really I remember\nThat there have been efforts to try and tie the Tea Party to violence and they were unsuccessful because the Tea Party was a remarkably not just non violent but peaceful and entirely law abiding movement and I think that that doesn't get talked about enough for obvious reasons media doesn't want to discuss\nHow well behaved and how civic or how much civic responsibility there was in the Tea Party movement\nUm shoes and rides you're so right on the DSD I've got the real thing and I'll trade might be TST in for election loss trauma any day\nBecause it is not really a but not really because these are my protecting yourself as a coping skills Susan I'm yes Jews and the fact that liberals were running around saying they think they have the DSD because Trump won the election tells you a lot about the fact that they do need a safe

of unvaccinated individuals' come to the U. S. entering school systems all over the country\nWell Joanne this is a concern a real one but people get very tense about it because whenever you talk about migrants and disease they say that that's inherently racist you're saying migrants are dirty and unclean and all this that's not what anyone should say or or is saying who's reasonable on this issue\nBut there are concerns about vaccination a lack of vaccination of some of these American populations and there have been diseases that have been propping up popping up across the country that were thought to have been eradicated not in large numbers but it is something to think about\nAnd they don't want to have this discussion and the people that want to get the CDC more involved want the facts out there and there are a lot of\nImmigration activists on the left who don't care and think that this was either ally which it is not there are people who are going to be having different levels of vaccination that that come into the country as part of these caravans\nOf and also just want to shut the whole thing down even if it is in July because I think it's more important we're clauses open borders Archie\nAnd that's the show today please please spread the word tell somebody listen to the ... show you can always listen on the on apple broadcast on the ... heart podcasting platform and the more that subscribed to better please also writes them reviews for the show just give me the the star rating if you\nCan on apple pie cast and say something about the show that you think makes it a special place see tomorrow she'll tie [noise]\nYou gotta keep your online activity you're browsing and all of that stuff [noise] pride you don't want to getting out there for marketers for scammers for fraudsters and if you're engaging with your tablet iPhones are computer guess what your information can be tracked and can be used if you want to avoid all that\nYou want to take back your privacy use express\nVPN [noise] I Know what it's like I Am from CIA and the NYPD and selling division and we have all kinds of security training\nYou want somebody to make sure that your information is protected expressed VPN has after when she was in the background and make sure that your information does not get used and abused take back your privacy folks\nProtect your online activity find out you can get\nThree months free with expressed VPN dot com slash bar that express VPN dot com slash book for three months free with a one year package express VPN dot com slash bar [noise]\n\n\n\nTargeting birthright citizenship I'm Carmen ...
