ears open on this one and hope to get more facts more information more data upon which to base our analyses shoe\nJulianne right it's\nThe way you hear the news talking about the reporter ... at first I thought it was one of ours there's just not our issue not our citizen and not on our territory I feel like this wouldn't have been so big an issue of Trump had not just ... getting our pastor ... and not just succeed and got her past her back\nOr why are these people not getting arrested\nGen do you mean the people the Saudi people that are because they were arrested or are we talking about the caravan I'm not clear right me again and let me know\n... book my wife and I just returned from our annual trip to Albuquerque and for the international ballooned fiesta\nAnd we always worked in a couple of days in El Paso well out there I like to watch a lot of local news whenever I'm Out of town and during the commercial breaks there were obviously tons of political ads several which featured the highly touted Beto O'Rourke\nThis was my first experience at length with send your or ... or send your or send your\nO'Rourke sorry stuff send your or Rourke is a lot easier to say and\nI came with a thoroughly non plus he's not all that photogenic he can speak incomplete sentences with the crappy throws out is purely style over substance he of course accused Republicans of a smear campaign against him with the DWI attempted escape and when he threw out it's not a Democrat or Republican thing I stop worrying about him\nObama concern me two thousand for this speech at the DNC ... concerns me zero empty shoot except he seems to issue shoots whenever possible Dale Dale I I think that they are going to try to make a better way national\nFigure I I think that they do believe that even though he couldn't win in Texas\nOr they might think of him as a presidential contender because that's the only way the Democrats are believed that they can win was to run somebody who has a national level profile even if they don't have national level political experience that's what I think I'm\nChad Wright's book love your stuff however you don't have the knowledge or experience to take on the vaccine topic either learn more about both sides of the issue or just don't talk about it it's no elitist liberals who choose not to vaccinate many conservatives like my wife and I was over forty years in the health care field between us don't vaccinate our six kids\nIf you want to understand both sides and when the answer any questions you may have\nFor many it's always and accept the risk until it happens to their child good parents aren't the ones unwilling to look at both sides shield side shot OK chat\nUm I I don't pretend to have any knowledge about this other than just what I can read and what I can learn on my own I I have no professional experience in medicine or health at all\nI Do have access to a number of people in my personal and professional network who I Believe would be considered world class MDs including somebody who is chief of infectious disease at one of the biggest and most well regarded hospitals in New York City\nAnd they I can tell you they have no time for the vaccines cause autism discussion and debate they think that it's essentially like saying that the moon landing didn't happen they do not take it seriously at all as an intellectual position worthy of debate\nSo I I can pass that along to you and by the way they're conservatives so I mean there are people that politically I happen to agree with all of that doesn't matter for this discussion but they're not a liberal is caught up in some kind of a fad\nThey I've asked them about this a few of them\nAnd they're very definitive and I know people get very mad at me I'm just the messenger here man I have yet to meet a doctor in fact that would be my challenge you give me a well regarded or epidemiologist or a or MD with decades of experience\nAnd an incredibly a acclaimed record who will tell me that vaccines are dangerous and people should not get vaccinated\nAnd then I'm happy to take that on board as something that might sway me to one side of the argument the other\nI can just tell you chat I've never come across that and I've asked a lot of people about this\nAnd all I get are people that get mad at me and then they send me a link to a blog that has nothing other than just somebody posting other blog link articles and that's it so I I asked him when it when I talk about the global warming debate or climate change whatever they call it the other side says well there are no\nThere are no well regarded scientists who disagree with us and I know that's alive because I can name well regarded scientists Richard lens in a you know there there there are well regarded scientist on the record\nWho say that it is not true that climate change is the threat that we are led to believe I just wanted a well regarded MD to tell me that is a an insight to studies with the research for it and then I'll take that on board\nI just people get mad at me for this I Know they're very passionate about the topic I Am never given any reference or research that serious I'm just giving people that say well look at Suzie so and so who talked to Bobby so and so who knows the guy who was like a really important researcher and\nSays that vaccines cause autism\n... people can get mad at me all they want I just I'll change my opinion when I have some factors some research that's all I don't know so I appreciate your right and in chatter I'm Glad that you love my stuff and uh I Hope you look at your mad at me for this response to you but I Am befuddled because I Know people get mad at me for this one including my own team\nI don't know what they want me to say give me some evidence and not something that's a you know like looks like it's linked off the world net daily website give me some actual real studies and evidence and I and then I Will change my mind\nA hold on\nA given rights have out there should be an easy movie quote a ... a pop quiz hotshot will devotees easy that's obviously from speed Dennis Hopper speaking to Keanu Reeves mark writes helped me understand because show the a Saturday citizen killed by Saudis and he's Saudi conflict on foreign\nSoil why do we care about there's so much when mark would care about it so much because it's an opportunity\nTo go the Trump Administration into either report reaction or to hammer the Trump Administration for the under reaction in the eyes of the media that's what they so they either want an overreaction that harms U.S foreign policy\nOr they want an under reaction that will uh be something that can just hammer Trump for what it's our problem because it's Trump's problem in the eyes of the media that's the real answer\n[noise] and that's where I'm going to leave it today for roll call team every day this week coming to live from the swamp do ask if you get a

and you know ... chicken those who have listened to my show\nKnow about the famous ... if I can find it I'll play it they know about the famous chicken rent okay it's a well known story it's a legendary ground zero story about how I went to a Halloween party\nAnd I came back this to be tipsy ... on the air it's first time I've ever done that because I don't go on the air and drunk or high or anything but I went on the air this was when I was local and I was feeling a little tipsy went to a great party in the afternoon it was one of the afternoon parties thought I'd be okay\nCame on the air and I just started you know talking shooting from the hip shooting from the hip I started getting to how terrified I was of chickens okay and\nThe reason why I'm terrified of chickens is because when I was a kid\nI once tried to sneak in my backyard from a field okay and there was the barbed wire fences next door to this this family that we because we lived out in this rural area called mid veil Utah\nAnd next door to us was this a Mexican family I mean they were they spoke Spanish they just beginning she kept kids spoke English but uh just barely\nAnd uh I used to have this kid named junior but he was really Jose and he spoke English ... broken English but I decided to sneak home from school and go through the field crawl through the barbed wire\nBarb wire fence it was to keep that roosters and the chickens from\nGetting I crawled into the barbed wire fence got attacked by the head rooster just poking my faith is the debt tacking me and it was like I'm bleeding I'm getting attacked it's like something out of Alfred Hitchcock's the birds right but it's chickens chickens\nAre just attacking me right and just talking at my face\nAnd Iran to my mom at random I doubt I'm bleeding\nAnd so my dad goes over\nOf course the old man's over there man he's drunk ... drunk and my dad says your roster and my son in law is me and so I guess that Miguel who is one of the older\nKids\nSodomy bleeding and he said that's it so he went and he got himself a rake and he went any chased after the rooster what the raking finally hit it and there'd been goes\nAnd it just stops so he grabs a knife and he grabs the Nick of the chicken and he goes [noise] cuts the head off the chicken right and then the damn rooster comes\nAfter me [laughter] you know you're a little kid writing things coming up you where do we do with its\nHead chopped off any bad enough Jose thought it was funny he wet and grabbed the chicken ... the chickens foot\nAnd he found the nerve on the end of the chickens for they pull on it and the chickens chickens handle it it class you know the class read these poor them and they're terrifying as a kid right terrified\nBy one had experience with ...
