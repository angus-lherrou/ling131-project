Washington ... the other day with a B loved her comment about someone writing his comments about the bomber on teleprompter like no one ever did that before I Love the show so all the pick of you and your parents in D.C looks like your dad has the same swoop\nCarla thank you for that time comics about my parents I'm Bret Baer I I think that I was able to\nSay exactly what I really wanted to you on the circumstances which is always which I think is a very important for whenever you get one of those performances whenever you're doing that I also went on Shannon show on friday as you guys know\nSo that was another chance for me to say what was really on my mind uh and uh after my dad yeah my dad has\nGreat hair it's true great hair he's got he's got a silver swoop now in fact I could probably be his call ... silver scoop\nBut it was so good to see my parents um I got the best parents in the world so that's a big advantage that I've had in life you know I Know you've probably got great parents too but other than your parents are probably the second best parents world I think modern number one but we can agree to disagree on that\nUh so it was it was great to see them we a lot of fun and it's nice to get some visitors down here in the swat man the swamp can feel a little little lonely not enough team bucking the swamp got to be honest with you guys are spread out all around the country and a lot of you are in states where you've got all you've got fellow patriots\nAll around you're not like knee deep behind enemy lines can be crazy\nAh let's see misty rides what do those of us in liberal\nCalifornia do about the fact that we are surrounded by these crazies well\nYou know it's uh there's no easy answers um I Wish I could say that I had a a straightforward do this to tell you but you know I think you engage where you can and that's it you know you you do where do you think it's a bad idea\nIt's not worth it sometimes Jennifer ... yesterday I attended a lecture presentation by Arthur Sulzberger\nGermany in New York Times called the impact of media and truth on democracy I went with an open mind is I always try to approach things in life this way because many people surprise me over the years\nHowever I found Sulzberger statements so cliche is an interesting he said all the things you talked about recently on your show speaking truth to power how we live in dangerous times journalist or unsafe et cetera et cetera I lost track of how many times to use the words danger or dangerous however he's definitely a capitalist\nHe bragged about I'm In New York times successfully mounted monetize their online media and when asked a question from the audience and how the New York times could be more accessible middle class Sulzberger said the cost of bank New York times is worth it or get the truth\nWhen you find yourself in northern California again I could ... have you speak at our local university we need to hear a more conservative voices especially on campus in California keep finding a good fight shields Hi Jennifer\nOh thank you Jennifer for that interesting perspective and and telling me what's going on with that Sulzberger lecture that that's not surprising all by the way the New York times is in many ways the most arrogant\nOf all media out there and the and it's left wing and I don't know how many of you saw at the last week I asked their chief White House correspondent for the New York times are you a liberal paper and he said no\nAnd I just look at him like dude I I understand that you know that's the that's the company line but come on that really we're we're going to do this we're really going to do the New York times is not liberal it gets all the editorial pages liberal but the overall paper is\nIs just a newspaper no that is not true the New York times as liberal paper and they should just own it you know that they shouldn't beat around the Bush and pretend or something that they're not I don't see this is really all that\nComplicated I really don't but they they make it complicated because they like\nThe pretense of being neutral they think that neutrality and objectivity\nHeightens the strength of their voice whereas if they admitted to partisanship even though they're hyper partisan then they could not claimed to just be the troops objectivity they're clearly not that\nI Will stop with uh what's up with this one a book\nYou miss the anniversary of the battle for Pancho bread and your right I Am so sorry\nI forgot to tell you guys all about ... if you want to go to go to Google and type in the bug Sexton show and the battle of ... and you can listen to the old the Pancho chauffeur old time sick you're right I did miss ... anniversary this year though I Am I'm slipping in my old age Tyler writes love your show man shield side Tyler\nYou're the man thank you I'm going to end on that and I like it ...\nAll the auto shield\n[noise] might have seen the headlines from last week or so now they're starting to blame social media sites that don't do enough in order to get rid of the content that they decide is violence\nBoos de oh that's right the left wing media the people that are trying to tell you that they're progressive ideology\nJust so happens to constantly results in the censorship of conservative but you know it's the algorithm manned there's nothing really going on there [noise] malarkey you know if you want a place where you can go and share your thoughts that sniffy dot com I've got a W dot com account I Love being able to interact with\nActually dragging their blood\nSacrifice amusing knives or other means I'm an older\nDraining the blood and using the blood and ritual drinking the blood in order to get human or at least thinking they were getting eternal life from one of the human we talked about this the other night with the empire show we did the idea of ambrosia being me drink of the guy\nOdds well\nWhat are the more hard core beliefs of the drew was the threshold or the threefold best in what version of the three fold that that individual has three simultaneous causes of death for example wounding hanging or drowning\nHe's causes of death or usually a punishment predicted in advance and naturally there's only a few recorded instances of them given how unlikely at triple death happens in life\nBoth the cross and the serpent were secret to the Jewish so they made the former by cutting off all the branches of an oak tree they fashioned one of them to the main trunk in the form of the letter T\nSo it was a staff with across to the top\nIlliterate tea and then on that oh can cross they would put a snake and so this open across cut to the tea with the snake\nThe healing deity the vapor okay\nAnd many of you know if you read anything in the Bible [noise] you're right about the fiery servants in the Bible\nAnd how Moses did the same you took what looked like a tea took it from a branch made it into a team put the snake on it and today we have a similar\nType of symbol called the conducive which you see that all the time in doctors' offices run ambulances that could use this as the snake coiled around the the tea or called around what appears to be across with wings\nA mercurial healing wand what you'd call it and it represented the it represented the sorcery of healing one's body through corps was known as course medicine and of\nCourse when as soon as basically taking the dead and using them for the living or using the living the blood putting it into the body making the body whole so either you would\nSee the doctor and he would give you a good bleeding where they would either puts slugs on your on your they drain you of all the bad blood and then you try to replace it with a good place and some people would have to be sacrificed in order to have a good blood and usually it was the elite there would drink the blood or eat at the heart or or any of those types of sacrifices that were known in the times withdrew even before that\nSo it's okay to cross with the snake coiled around it\nWas the healing simple you know that same symbol is the dollar symbol have you ever noticed that the dollar symbol is an ass with a line through it but what are you originally was was the snake winding around a poll\nAnd that's how you got\nThe symbol for money another healing symbol because money they say he was a lot of hills but certainly it's the root of all evil and some say that that old staff of the producers is the evil Mary making of doctors using the blood and the organs and all sorts of things for their own\nLittle rituals so you've got across from the surf but sacred to the roads\nCutting the branch putting on the snake and then they worship today and it did it was formed well from the sun moving the stars combination Jehovah bail and those Cyrus\nTravel on was the name of that God do you hold the bail Cyrus the mixture of travel on so that drew it's called the descendants of the serpent because they held the serpent on the staff\nAs what they would hold and they would represent healing and represent the medicine mended represent those who are there to come for your blood\nSo\nThere were hidden circuits the amen of old Egyptian fame they called me on the aim at the end all be all\nPretty much why we said a prayer say in the name of our lord and savior
