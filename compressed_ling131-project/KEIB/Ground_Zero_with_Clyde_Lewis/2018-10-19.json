coming on later\nNBC's or non player characters are the newest me that have appeared on Twitter and Facebook and they seem to be a form of counter propaganda against the liberal left\n\nThe popular NBC mean trend frames it's targets as non player characters reflect simply spout Neal Marxist axiom Z in response to real world events this is a nice way of digging back\nAt the propaganda of every one calling one side racist one side not the one side this one side that outright Nazi storm front blah blah blah blah and stuff you always hear\nOf your on that side if you're on the side of the other guys you must be a Nazi well that's the kind of stuff that they're doing they're coming up with his clever mean covered in PC he's NBC's have caused anger a lot of anger\nBecause those who see them feel they argue humanizing however I think that's the point I mean\nThere clearly are being used to exploit what we usually hear his program responses regarding things like fascism where it's like not see 'em\nAll right KKK all all the same stuff over time\nThe NBC mean mocks leftists and expressionless in appearance they're like these ... that ... they they basically make everything look like a lot\nOn line\nI mean it's basically it's designed to look like in a casual or a causal observer that it's marginalized in program [noise]\nSo I mean if if you see one of these in PC they're they're pretty nondescript they're like [noise]\nI don't know how to describe me like plain face to die of a little nose with a smile or a straight face looking like [noise]\nZombie I guess it's just
