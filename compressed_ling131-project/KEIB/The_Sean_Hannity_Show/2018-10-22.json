they think they're defending me and they're defending ... they're not doing it to\nThe harm you or any of those things they're doing it because they believe it to be true the unfortunate part is when

fundamentalist communities and fundamentalism in its in its core\nIs wonderful\nIt's this is this is what we believe and we're sticking to it more understanding and an open mind it's not by having an open mind for the sake of an open mind I don't understand that\nPeople say oh well you you you do closed minded well you know what an open mind is the same as an open mouth it's open until something

and carrots Fox News Mexican the agents blocking the Central American migrants briefly before allowing them in at the southern border Fox is William ... is\nAnd talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nAh he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is unreal legal jeopardy in all of this you also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThere was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mother may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker no saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we do that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nHanded information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lives that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the ... the judges that it was Hillary Clinton the paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally begin to get to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it just with us\nFormer congressman now Fox News contributor all throughout New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova up to ... with us a thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what\nAs they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on for that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the OJ won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also familiarize themselves with is mark Elias market why it was ... he was ... for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that the ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threaten to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think is important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope they send you were talking to your former French and telling them to get them to uh get him in to the Congress to take\nThis ad and I don't care if they're not going to I'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenas first and then you negotiate later\nYou don't say oh my God he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now we have to think about scene and you said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it Thursday that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on of course it gets so subpoenas but let me just say this 'cause this is really important\nAll the names that you heard Michael fuss\nMr liar Simpson or all those people they are ... to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating\nIs what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has an important issue a subpoena score we now know that the FBI or am I fix\nAnd that you see a few to conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information\nWas fat conversations of George Papadopoulos\nWere intercepted and in the course of the intercepting those compensation they found out that Papadopoulos was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information to the by the court you\nKnow it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover\nPeter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something that there is no there are there and then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in\nAnd what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion but they\nThat number people John granted James Clapper on down all the way into the White House committed crimes and it Jeff Sessions\nAnd Rod Rosenstein cannot figure out a way to do this and by the way John Huber up Utah at the head fake\nDoing nothing six months without a record I'd like to bring the budget indictments tomorrow use ... this is an outrage with general elections in both inside of tolerated either the credit it's waiting till after the election to get rid of them and I say to hell with both of them All right\nThank you what's going to happen Jason ... you see a new attorney general down their own\nThoughts soon enough I just put up a piece that I wrote about sessions can't go soon enough worthless use their name only the really should be a ... a second special counsel to look into Brandon and all these cast\nOf characters we've been talking about over the last few minutes they did the president needs that employees well they're they're making that decision himself\nYeah absolutely you could push that for a ... and and releasing the documents that Congress absolutely\nYeah I think all of that needs to happen or orange twenty two days before the election mostly what goes on from here a thank

V. I. L. J. B. T. Q. it's law enforcement it's veterans are\nThe candidates said and then Stacey Abrams is her name\nIt's made up of those who were told they are not worthy of being here those who are documented and those who are undocumented so I guess she's saying that the blue wave is going to include undocumented people voting in Georgia that's going to be interesting to GOP nominees by the guy by the name of Brian Kemp\nTelling Fox News that Abrams wants the illegals to vote in Georgia\nAnd said I think hard working Georgians should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like what my opponent wants and adding that it would be unlawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in the gubernatorial election\nBy the way I told you last week about Christian a cinema now she's going up against Martha ... one of the important races that were following and how she uh had referred\nTo her own home state and people in our state of Arizona being crazy and the meth capital of the world and all the Washington Examiner apparently found emails that show cinema herself inviting a prominent group I'm not making this up of I'm reading from the Washington Examiner of feminist which is\nIn Arizona called pagan cluster to celebrate International Women's day in the protest the war\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely show they're really two aggravating factor here when you already brought up the fact that this happened\nI'm In a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single but protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well and you know aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media and I think this is ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual aka so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in a diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's a sign that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudi there's this is not as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them were on a razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I think Trump get one more thing I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they\nSeemingly tried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you know we had to be responded to there was not you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah they're ... to ... and just to see the the thing that not only the threats that worries me that Dan just said\nIt seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they're likely to president on that you know the president came up to the king and ... among the crown prince that called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale and must be something that we do not elevate it looks like they have like the president I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to another link that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and so we didn't know but I mean I I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the\nIn Saudi Arabia and well okay you're going to happen I mean ... there's been a women I chronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting and driving et cetera and being told how to dress\nOr being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera I'm ... I'm sure you had to cover up if you left if you went out in public anywhere and what was life life like for you as a woman living under Sheree there\nYou know this is such an excellent point that you're bringing in China and the reason is is that what we actually last year\nWasn't modernization and Saturday\nWe saw it when that being able to drive we saw the ... the government that I had to wear it cut the ... I thought you were sort of looks like a high school graduation of people have seen it on television probably or if you live in a major us the most people the people who dress observant link but it's such a great clean found that people aren't talking about what you just said is that it\nHas been an incredibly repressive regime as it relates to ... for many years and and this and this new\nRules or oppressive as it relates to Judaism and Christianity and lesbians or either slogged or killed is not true\nAbsolutely him but that's for me what's\nSo unfortunate about this incident and why I Hope it gets corrupted very quickly is that we will actually singing modernization static thing look or you know a more liberal or such to women's rights limits education when driving and that played the crown prince had built up such\nGood well around the world is because he was taking a different approach so really saddens me to see them go so far backwards from what was really an\nInteractive at the past year to change things right last for ...\nYeah Morgan's right they were trying to diversify the economy get away from our strictly Petro dollars\nAnd I mean this is an enormous enormous step back strong you know there there's no covering this up if they have to admit that they did this ... and\nThe details of this come out there's a risk because we think of this going to be some explaining to do I just encourage everybody to keep the whole global picture in mind here uh when doing we can't start World War three over this although sub there has to be a some form of a upcoming clean by the Saudis some form of a of retribution there's no\nDoubt that they want to pass it on to people and the consulate and I don't believe for a second that they didn't know or at least the crown prince did no sooner than this uh All right thank you all pre shit it uh Morgan Ortega and are are good friend\nA dam bond Gino eight hundred nine four one shown is our number next hour by the

know fake news and they're not real news people and their phony journal is I think that's just that's the exercise of free speech\nMy hearing you write you use to organize protests in front of

of except the president say they didn't get any tape at this time I\nAm a pro government newspaper reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing well I Would assume that watch exists in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but\nBefore leaving Riyadh aid Pompeo told reporters that the Saudi leaders made no exception to the one who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus official Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that that in fact happened on the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely the show that he could have broadcast the signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the Saturday councilor wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen\nBut I don't think we should\nTo judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later\nJoining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight\nDefending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan hop but Fox News contributor to thirty or CIA up operations

from the battlefield must be questioned uh I think this man is that whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain\nThat this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that's the new often an avid won regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't and Americans that trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common type ... you wrote commentary\nAnd he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the biggest\nArab arms deal out of the twentieth century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hot but it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil roof brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth no there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nYeah I I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudi\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to let the day the show he entered and we know he ... never exited the cost of ...\nA week do the makeup of those of the

killed\nOr what we don't know\nWhat were the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to hold that they report posts Puerto those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think was a hundred percent right to dispatch secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they were a issue of rape is a concern to us we'll get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that once their game could it probably was poisoned back in March\nBritish home secretary said that\nWe needed a void speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here and the last thing I Would just highlight is that Well Secretary upon pay was meeting and doing it public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legal at ...\nAnd the other in a central or in an uncle or probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts not to collect the evidence but it's to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because also the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had many in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that\nWould cause the entire world um I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this with that um I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nBut it gets a little rough or what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat\nA Nazi ism in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean if you don't make the perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like politics itself domestically it is the author of the ... the um over the perfect on on the truth is we have a lot of leverage over Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very\nGood times through a and B as to bomb it been found them in a very those relationships are not going to be tested but this is a nation\nThat survival depends upon our support militarily and I'm ... and training so there's a lot but reachable average against Saudi Arabia but you're absolutely right this is part of a\n... I Wish we would've leverage did in the last eight years when Obama was president we know knowing that gays and lesbians were killed were routinely and Christians and Jews are persecuted and women are treated like for class citizens I mean you know that never seems to come up when there's a Democratic president\nShort can I can I give you one example of how bad it was so this guy who was a deep deep sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood\nPresident Obama when he went on his global opponents tools and he started it in future who worked in the front row of that event sitting there\nAnd show the environment five year Obama White house the Muslim Brotherhood chief representative that how big a difference in the lecture and make sure\nYeah or Dan Hoffman what are your thoughts\n[noise] well you know this is a bit of a self inflicted well Shawn from the Saudis I mean if if\nThe two countries that are mostly about if is Iran and Russia they did absolutely nothing to call what is a risk now between the United states and Saudi Arabia I really believe that there are certain elements of our relationship that has to be immune\nIt but it's very dangerous when government officials with security clearances or providing um that that information to our enemies very very serious issue Sean\nWhat do you think Dr Gorka less work [noise] uh we need to find that in America if lady justice still work with a blindfold or Las Vegas and you go to a committee so it was really about the show\nReally is a double standard just reached Ohio having 'em anyway congrats by the way of uh his brand new book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies uh I'd say that's something we really need to remember as a country\nUm thank you both for being with us when we come back to ...

is the most disgusting thing to me is the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put this to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it is backfiring on her and I I'm Glad to see it because she was she needs to come out and apologize to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not

by the way twenty five now till the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren will she does have to get re elected a senator or she wants to think about running for president from the right state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six the Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American\nCookbook that is entitled how while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth Native American\nLet me interpret it another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this then tries to prove\nTo her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst than I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here other question\nIs I I Know that Massachusetts land solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but the really want or elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level\nTo advance her career all throughout her career as your senator well do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also a different point select the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible jobs that are the people in Massachusetts can wake up how you doing\nToday showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm stuck around one when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston patrolman association has never endorsed a Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist friends at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty I'm\nNo focus on Massachusetts whatsoever on\nPrice and today will supplies less you can get started with a trial month for just five bucks that's right five dollars here's what you do just go to Fort ... dot com F.

started in Central America now an estimated seven thousand heading for the U.S border where they're willing to take their chances despite us efforts to stem the flow\nAnd then you've got a case an allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements that his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of me to\nOut there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this if you want to predict it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida you'll do a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best\nPolitician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott\nThere for you and the same with uh we've got infinite whatever reason the media's fall in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know Ron dissent this about a great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax Gillum would support\nGillum is we use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views he's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected\nBy being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe and what they really want to fight for we saw that with Brett us it and the project ... tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason Brett is it is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that is something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water\nAs they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony\nShe goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets what's so Harvey tour\nWith with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it isn't in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not gonna not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody is against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront\nOf the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry I mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texans alone\nVictims of crimes some very serious including murder\nI mean it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing them throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer I have a heart attack but\nThe anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty Eighteen electorate with the party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half hour we're going to we're going to take control of the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away it looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha mix Sally is going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo that we have top Democrats are urging caution and the blue wave to temper expectations of new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about quote the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions mid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom for as it was still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black um ... Marshall mixed Martha ... Sally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller holds the seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly the problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race\nAnd that means that the libertarian siphoning votes away from the Republican Ron\nMike Braun is now claiming that you know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now has him leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this an app to all of this this is an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is that an all time high but you know I'm Crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nMean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and and we have four thousand people or around there in Beaumont at a huge crowd in Houston as well\nWe're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got to force the hypocrisy so we got the cabin on your shoe\nGlenn Beck program morning it's gone the\nLongest time\nJang ... proposing a middle class

Sean Hannity on the patriots am eleven fifty\nWage that's part of the story of the president now has alerted the military to be on standby for possible deployment orders to the U.S southern border\nI mean this is in every word you know I remember I think Michelle mountain wrote a book years ago called invasion\nThe American people I Know the Democrats they're thinking this is their moment this is good for them I don't I don't see how any of this is good for the\nDaily Caller has a piece out saying that the majority of people in the ... not ... that are headed to the borders are not as is being reported families including women and children\nAbout instead they're quoting multiple reports that this new way above\nA caravan hers is comprised quote of mostly young men who appear able bodied and could easily fend for themselves back in their home countries video footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants\nYou know behind a chain link fence at the Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men scaling the fence others violently shaking it causing the barrier to break apart and as the gap on the fence white and then of course a lot of the men from that moment we're able to cross\nInto Mexico and this is now a confrontation that is coming to the southern border of the usa I've been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why wherever many times\nI have seen it it's wide open what are we gonna what's gonna happen if we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports as even helping the caravan or make their way to our southern border\nPresident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally it is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give it to them\nBut the president also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty they're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies\nThat allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out there well you know it just I mean\nBasically a national emergency if you look at it\nYou have a Spanish language reporter who spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan in a report friday said that they have met people from Bangor ... dash\nThat are joining the people from Guatemala into Mexico Univision corresponded Francisco Santa Ana reported that the bridge separating ... while the mullah in Mexico the British has been packed with thousands of migrants demanding access to Mexico this was going back to friday the ultimate goal crossing into the U.S illegally\nShe writes the Bangladeshis were detained and an immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after their detention the borders and Central America not as strong as the U.S which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nA said a ... on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country\nAnd yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly [noise] um so you've got the care of and continuing their march now a couple of other things that you've got to understand here and there is a political\nThing having been to the border everywhere from the Rio Grande the San Diego\nHelicopter horseback boats all terrain vehicles you foot I'd been out there I've seen even gang members arrested right in front of me while I was there so and the entire family

I\nDon't recall when he said America was never that great and they they embrace Maxine Waters when she got harassed anybody support our president\nContracts that vision for where they want to take the country\nAs we've talked about before with what the president has accomplished at Twenty one month with his leadership in this country taxes regulations down economy growing it for ... percent lower on employment forty years course each and cabin on the court\nOut of the Iran deal embassy in Jerusalem it on and on we could go so those are the competing visions those are the ... that's the contrast I think when American step back and look they're going to pick Republicans or we're going to keep the majority of the house\nBetween no due process for Kavanaugh no presumption of innocence for Kavanaugh these are core values that have served as well as a country and then you've got this lawless caravan and I I don't hear a single Democrat saying we've got to stop\nWhat is it looks like an invasion fourteen thousand people just want to run across the border maybe more and if that happens what's gonna happen after that\nIt's like a party that is basically given up on the rule of law unconstitutional and the values that have served do so well over these many years\nExactly right or the most extreme positions ... got closer with this comment you got\nFormer Secretary Clinton said oh yeah we'll get civil again once we have power that's not supposed to be this great nation and like you said before it's sort of tough to avoid the immigration issue when you've got this caravan merging north thousands and thousands of people um I think the president's right when he's talking about you're not going to get your foreign aid if this if this is going to continue\nAnd talking about putting folks on the border putting troops on the board according National Guard in order to make sure\nThat we saw what happened last friday in Mexico at their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now a ... it's almost like we're headed towards a major\nHuman confrontation here people that don't affect our laws in sovereignty and the president saying you must respect our laws and sovereignty um no I I think Democrats in the back of their heads hoping this happens so all maybe something bad will happen and Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you never know I Hope I Hope not I pray not\nYeah same here but I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady couldn't is that a Republican events Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said I'm In I'm sick of this kind of stuff she gives it the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted to start her goals and dreams in this great nation\nThat's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happen and the and the possible political implications\nAnd motivations behind these things that's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming assign um aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem that we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to confront either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watch that happen a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nA we saw Mitch McConnell go through this at the airport and then this weekend that happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have now Henry Kissinger was shouted down listen to some of this [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\nI got a Ninety two year old man who served his country it's a\nYou know it's unbelievable you know what the names of what's her name Maxine Waters you you clear the crowd you confront them you'd do you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Mitch McConnell Leo country you know then we have you know Eric Holder kick them Hillary you can't be civil with somebody you disagree with\nNo this is this is as wrong as it gets this is not how ... eat some people are supposed to\nBehave in and it is you know where the part that bothers me the most Sean is Dennis could send it is a good friend of mine and he is as far as I Am not is actually a lovely guy he's a wonderful guy he's a\nAnd he would never act that he wants to pay the ideas you'll show up and have a robust debate like we are supposed to win this great nation but he would never this is the new left this isn't new to this is the way ... ... ... and people who believe in their positions and their ideas and their their policy that's the way it's supposed to be\nI'm a volunteer tutor and mentor why because over a million kids the drop out of school and that's not okay you know it takes twelve years to create a graduate but at the same time you created

Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he's at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in our country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that has not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any kids that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspirations in America is about passing the ... to\nThe baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is it you cannot system the ties or through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives it's\nNot only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here\nBut there's no moderation left either mulch and the Democratic party it used to I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they meet contact with reality\nOr disaster for a country a person a citizen and you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the malarkey\nYeah All right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is one of those Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs are and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well\nThat's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nAnd listen we're all big supporters here on the Sean Hannity showed the second amendment also\nResponsible gun owners that's why we're friends with the USCC a they're giving away free gun every day twenty four days now you'll

through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors Carolina family cannot pay the rent the father has lost the job he's a blue collar worker Fred in the sun or looking at them saying okay no problem\nThere very often guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job well and behold a short days later a he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed a and it's just a wonderful story that their family never\nGoing to be told by the mainstream media but people talk about what does the president has compassion British people does the president that apathy and the answer is yes she learnt that at the riding shotgun with his father\nWas he was either building these buildings helping to build buildings are collecting rent for blue collar people that were living shot so so I Want to get a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of the Trump family which is a great American success many ways the added he family is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh but they're both part of America the artists that broke up America\nYou know the the generations that built this country and its Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations I built this country are just amazing people the immigrants that built this country by grandparents all for coming from
