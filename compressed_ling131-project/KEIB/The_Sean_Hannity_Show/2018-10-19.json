Tennessee thanks to project beret toss we've learned with Claire McCaskill caught on undercover videos you can play outrageous we needed investigation investigation into what\nThe fact that you and your own words are saying to the people in Missouri I'm a liar I Am a fake phony fraud I Am a I'm just a phony\nI'm a liar I'm saying whenever I Need to say to get elected I don't mean any of it my job is to bamboozled the people of Missouri lie to them they can go to Washington and I'm going to govern just like Iraq Obama\nThey can't win a state of mind who they really are they can't win if they give us their true agenda\nThey can't win if they say yeah we really want to impeach Trump impeach forty five impeached forty five and Pete forty five reclaiming my timer claiming my time they tell Maxine Waters don't say it was ... I don't want to talk about\nIt just don't say it they tell her and she says they told me not to say it but I'm going to keep saying in any way\nSo their agenda is impeachment and lists never ending investigations open borders eliminate ice sanctuary cities now we have a sanctuary state California\nThey want oh why did they want to open borders do they calculated that's going to benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision and every agenda item is about them wanting to hold on to power period\nIt doesn't matter the output uh the the what the end result is doesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you could recite them by rote as well\nThe only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take us back to that they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven by a borderline like tonic hatred of this president\nThey want to go back to what back to Obamacare they won't open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power for ever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans of people\nAre going to talk about what the president's planning and it's like that's what they stand for\nThis is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs heat both by Medicare open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what the one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better\nBecause after losing Thirteen million Americans and and having them have to go through food stamps to survive and sustain them\nCells in eight years of a failed autonomy of Obama the only president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in American history you know they want to what we don't want to add more people\nWhy 'cause they're dependent on them the crumbs they're handing out the irony of that they're ... what what did the leftovers they have\nYou know when they're done building their gyms their Senate gyms their house Kim's there you know house barber shops there Senate barber shops the Senate dining rooms their house dining rooms or they treat themselves well they're not they're not on Obamacare they got to separate out system just for them\nVery different so that's what's at stake you're not going to tell you something about this border as I watch this care of it\nYou've got to understand this is about national security this is personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years and I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times site antidote you've told us that before\nYeah I've been on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot yeah I've been all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego in many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life floor to ceiling drugs confiscated guess where they were headed\nTo Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever\nBut there's now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country\nIs is one the one issue is oh kids go into grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet\nThey try a bike it in a Percocet anoxic on and then they go back they got another one next thing you know they're addicted next thing you know they're buying them on the streets God Knows what those pills really are the drug dealers don't give a rip it these kids die\nThen when they find out that can't afford eighty bucks a pill well then some genius idiot friend or dealer friend quote of there's there's one you try heroin does much better ... totally ten dollars a bag\nAnd they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it and they light up in smoke it and then eventually you're going to remain lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border what's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's all fat and all\nYou don't talk to my buddy Eric poli his Nineteen year old son ... bought an ... which is you know to relieve anxiety\nAnd and and it was laced if you have three grains of fat and all the size of three grain of salt\nIt will kill you and we have nearly a hundred thousand kids dying every single day one death every seven point five minutes\nYou know almost a hundred thousand deaths a year and we keep talking about opioid crisis left and right opioid we can stop it if we secure the border\nCaravans now so I think it's right I think Kavanaugh what do we see what's happened all\nThe total total elimination of anything that we recognize as the U.S constitution the rule of law equal justice under the law equal application of our laws or the presumption of innocence what presumption of innocence I Believe her never heard from a bribe believer\nYou know that no corroborating evidence I still believe her you\nKnow but then ... no no no but but they were lined up almost on a weekend basis they wind up in the hall first they spike the punch bowl and after they fight the punch bowl the boys would wind up in the hall every weekend\nAnd then they rape the girls in the room they take turns and it happened almost every weekend and then the story evolved into well I didn't see him spike the punch bowl but I saw a mirror punch bowl\nAnd I see I saw him give out a red solo cup\nThat's what that became\nSo and then Dianne Feinstein wants to bring that up again\nAfter eight FBI investigations what are they offering for you because since Trump spent president you got four million new jobs since Trump's been president four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs jobs that Obama set will never coming back\nSince he's been president we've gotten rid of more regulations that in the last five presidents are combined uh he's opened up the entire energy industry of which we have a flawed\nLiterally of natural resources those are going to be career paying jobs high paying jobs for so many millions of Americans\nAre that we've got oh the president degrading ISIS nobody thought little rocket man would stop shooting is rockets nobody thought that you know being tough on the Iranians would would bear fruit but the Iranians are dying economically because of the president leading a boycott\nAnd then on top of that what record low unemployment fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace and youth unemployment\nPromoting greater increases muscles size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide\n\nWe're all along where you are and beautiful Palm Beach Florida Rush Limbaugh for the hours and I hope you'll tune in and be watching\nI'm looking at the caravan thinking for a thousand people four thousand migrants\nNow thankfully we actually have a president that stands up for the United states of America and thankfully we have a president that saying you know this is not going to fly with me or the American people\nAnd the president is now saying we're going to stop you in your track and the president has now poll Mexico and Honduras\nUm excuse me uh\nIn the strongest terms I'm asking Mexico doesn't sound like an ask\nAt is stop the onslaught\nIf you're unable to do so I Will call up the U.S military and close our southern border\nThen he posted another one continuing to blast Democrats because they're the ones that won't open borders eliminate ice in sanctuary cities and free health care for illegal immigrants course free means you pay for it\nI'm watching the Democratic party led because they want open borders and existing week laws assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd whose leaders are doing little to stop the large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico or to the U.S and he said that he will poll aid for these countries\nAnd then he said the assault on our country at the southern border including the criminal elements and drugs pouring in as far more important to me is president then trade and the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada\nHopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border this is all the Democrats fault week laws that of course they don't want to build the boardwalk guess what it also means it means more drugs\nComing into every small town a big\nCity

of the day I'm sure the election will come up you know ... phony mania you know ... you know what this whole thing with beta was figured it all up it's all outside\nTexas money it's all money from all liberals that just want to hurt Ted Cruz\nAnd we need Ted Cruz in the Senate he is you know he Mike Lee Rand Paul's that they're like the constitutional list in the U.S said\nThese are guys that have you know we don't have them they they are so critical in crucial\nTo passing you know all the good things that the president's gotten done and the pressure that they put on their leadership and on other senators I mean it's um it's a book\nYou know the irony is there is nothing fatal Rourke has in common with the average Texans nothing I he\nIt wouldn't be like Texas is really electing Chuck Schumer and that's what I keep saying if you don't care if it's you know Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee versus just Tony those caught on tape by project parrot toss spilled Bredesen\nI I just can't believe all these people you know no no we we we just saying we support cabinet and we would never support capital you out of your mind you insane you crazy or Claire McCaskill the same course I support all big major gun legislation of course in the second amendment as Chuck Schumer\nAnd but I'm not going to tell the people in Missouri that back I just I'm just hoping that you know I I'm just going to say what I Need to say get through the election well there's another term for that and it's called lying\nManipulating its called propaganda misinformation distortions they cannot say what they really believe and when they have to hide who they really are they ... you now have seen this\nThey the same people they won't can damn following Sarah Sanders into a restaurant ... chasing secretary Nielsen out of a restaurant or chasing Senator Cruz and his wife\nIs there with his wife and his family leave the the women and children alone how is that\nIn these particular cases but I guess the same people that wouldn't defend millennia Trump the same people that\nKnow when will the big huge you know drug eating lined up in the hall gang rape of women almost every weekend lie we believe that\nYou know the same ones they didn't ask for any information about Keith Ellison and what his girlfriend was accusing owed just this past summer it just it wasn't thirty six years ago\nIt was this year it was this summer with evidence doctors evidence text messages in a tape of it\nIt's you know I didn't know what ... calls for any FBI investigation no Dianne Feinstein she gets back to the Senate she said she wants another FBI investigation into Kavanaugh\nYou know they want to impeach him they want to impeach Trump open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice Obamacare we want our crumbs back and we have Trump did we tell you we hate Trump we hate Trump why do you ate Trump\nTrump solve the problems that you guys couldn't solve for eight years\nYou know where you created dependence on food stamps in the in the millions Thirteen to be exact where you put eight million more Americans\nIn poverty where we had the worst labor participation rate since the seventies oh we

like you're dying oh\nIf in fact this is a cut off point\nAnd I think there's many ways that the president many options you'll have in terms of dealing with it when the time comes and the president we know him he says he's going to do something he tends to keep his word I Can't think of an instance where he has\nBut here's what's frustrating to me all through the election and twenty sixteen on this program I sat here and I told you how much money Hillary Clinton took from all of these countries the practitioner Maria\nWhere marital rape isn't a crime where women are told by men how to dress where women need permission to travel or even travel abroad some cases can even leave the house without a male relative\nIt is a backwards repressive\nYou know the accuracy and some of these countries Kuwait among them the Saudi Arabians among them and others and there are countries that killed gays and lesbians their countries that persecute Christians and Jews\nThe Clintons took millions and millions and tens and tens of millions from these countries for their foundations and guess what we never heard ever criticize any of the policies\nThat treat women horribly gays and lesbians horribly Christians and Jews horribly Hillary Clinton\nThey bought her silence nobody ever talked about it I think for me\nAnd it's the same with the immigration side of the equation I don't if you grow up in that culture that abuses women that is the antithesis of our constitutional republic\nI'm Sorry we need to know that you were jak those values that are the tip assist of the values that we hold dear in near and cherish in this country\nNobody ever asks the Democrats about that or the same thing with with ... I mean we we leave these guys in in Benghazi and they're making deals with you know that's awfully\nGood grief\nSuch hypocrisy I mean they claim to be have a monopoly a compassionate all this but they want that wasn't it's complicated because you have an uh an unprecedented alliance that's emerged in\nAs a result of Iranian had Gemini and rainy and ... you know ambition to acquire nuclear weapons\nAnd the Iranians that chant death to Israel death to America burn the American flag burning the Israeli flag well you have an alliance because of that real clear and present danger to the world if you ever marry their version of radical Islam they're the number one\nTerrorist sponsoring the terrorist sponsoring state in the world\nThey fight so many different proxy wars fomenting ... around the world they're pursuing nuclear weapons and that is caused the U.S the Israelis the Saudis the Emirates the Egyptians the Jordanians to create an alliance\nIt's not so easy to just say as awful\nAs horrific an evil why believe they probably did it's not that simple there is more nuanced context texture it's sort of like the U.S aligning with the former Soviet Union to defeat the Nazis we hated the\nWere at odds with the\nPatent wanted to go right straight to Moscow if you're a member but it was an alliance that beat back the forces of fascism you know at that time and the forces of not seeing some at that time\nYeah but we're not a window of opportunity I Can't believe well I Can't believe because I've been telling you about sure we're radical Islamic State's theocracy is and how they abuse human rights subtle level second and that's why Hillary taking the money you know nobody not one Democrat care\nBut now they care because the Trump a bunch of phony ... is so full of it anyway um we're in Palm Beach it really is nice down here\nIt I mean this has really seriously nice down here and I you know I said the Russian go\nNow I Know I have a southern command and he pays no state income tax and I'm like I'm an idiot why am I paying ten percent state income tax I should be here in Florida beautiful view the ocean I down here\nHave listed if you believe in the second amendment you got to know about my great friends at the USCC a you know that they're giving away twenty four guns to twenty four responsible gun owners you get to pick the one that you want you just go to their website defend family dot com that's one word defend family dot com they have all the official\nRules you can text or that right now text the word protect P.

the New America because I didn't I don't remember that um [noise]\nWell that's certainly the America will desperate left because they're losing or the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's good I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I ain't gonna keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new electric violence a which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because it says Steve ... proved when he was shot um [noise]\nYou know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of\nVideotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg and that is a I it everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think like I I think he is the fourth a cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity\nAnd there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage\nAnd they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to Goldwater uh fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with them and in the end I think that just further isolates come\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they won in peach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration they want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just\nThat and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and that's partly because if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be a magic moment\nIn American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind are Kavanaugh and caravan I

move it was the war and stuff and all that here's a Mike in Tallahassee rates are happy with us or how are you\nAll doing great rush back a lot you bet yeah no question your opening question earlier was on the Democrats think they're going to retake the Congress and I think the answer ... and ... I Believe that the Democratic leadership\nSpokespeople which only a small percentage of the party hate Trump's so much so this role it's wide that them to the fact that most Democrats are apathetic because they have jobs the economy doing well\nAnd they have to admit that the president doing a lot of great thing but the leadership of the Democratic party is blinded by there aren't as\nWell there's no question about that the Democratic party leadership including in the media are obsessed with their hatred for Trump and so you think\nThey are so the wind blowing blindingly enraged by to pay them assume everybody else is\nIt that way they think that's going to produce the voter turnout that they did in ... during the presidential election that would change the leadership of the house\nWhat yeah okay you're kind of on my same page here I'm you know I'm looking at what has changed it's going to reverse the fortunes of the Democrats have been losing elections who have not been turning out voters\nIt isn't issue related because they're not proposing proposing any and they're certainly not advocating and they all they're doing is ripping and the bullying and so\nSo your theory is that they are fooling themselves that they're they think they've got this massive hate Trump movement out there that they've created that's going to show up in droves and sweep Republicans out of office\nDown most Democrats are admitting that the economy doing well they may not like the president techniques but they have to admit that\nWhy now wait a minute wait a minute what most Democrats where are you seeing most Democrats big grudgingly admit that the economy's doing well\nI unfortunately my entire family Democrat except for me and I are socialized took Democrats because they're nice people\nOkay but they are you are you concluding then that that there's not just your your like your family that that has been grudgingly admitting things are getting better they do not blindly hate Trump\nDon't they don't blindly eight Trump and don't feel like they both got our matter\nWhat so you're telling me they're not all that excitement show up and vote exactly [noise] so now you're you're calling from Tallahassee what are your what is your family's thoughts on Andrew Gillum\nI'm dangerous in a good way of bad was\nIt not I'm not sure dangerous can ever be good but it ...\nWell I'm the most dangerous man in America because it's good though I ended up at work and it can be good dangerous on\nAndrew Gillum is a democratic candidate for governor here he's up against Rhonda Santas and I'm the guy the guy is a is it dangerous is the right word but your family mostly Democrats are not into the guy is that what you're saying\nWell most of my family in the mid west [noise]\nWhat about Democrats said you know for the Democrats them at a nice people do\nThey are and and none of them support yellow because they watched it back as mayor of happy it when you ask them a bottom they looked at their shoes shake your head\nAll right so this is it's look all of this is ... by the way the word is a and\nE.

L. ethnic total some people think it's anti do all\nThat would be against adult all and there's no such thing as against ... there's no pro don't all there is no ... do do business and neck don't all and it just means it's unscientific here say it's just you know a person talking of four or five others and it's really dangerous to start projecting\nYou talked to a four or five Democrats who think prince okay maybe not the best guy with the economy is going great I I don't think I'm going to vote you can't take out those poor people and make it scientific that the Democrats are going to have a turnout problem even though that's what Mike is is passed away the usa hit his point is\nThat the Democrat leadership and the media leadership is really kind of alone they are enraged they are blinded by their hatred\nSo much so that they think everybody liked them hates Trump\nAnd this is going to drive Democrats back to the polls more than anything has since Obama in two thousand eight\n[noise] and it's the old it's the old negative there is such a thing as negative turnout but it's not meant as it's being the negative turnout is your turn out\nTo oppose something that you are Michael e\nWary of or afraid of\nAh the kind of negative turnout we're talking about here is Democrats turning out in droves because they um despise tromp and and so forth and he's just say he doesn't think that exists all across and threw out the Democratic party\nWe will see time will tell you not too long celebrating\nThe memory I miss work\nMy friends I enjoy things that are well may take cigars for example the details are what matter same goes for simply say home security\nTheir attention to detail in craftsmanship makes simply say system truly different from everything else out there it's easy to set up and it's easy to use and it works in the event of power outages are downed wires because there aren't any of those\nAnd there are no contracts get ten percent are simply say usa dot com that's simply safe usa dot com\nOr your brain is an amazing thing but as you get older it naturally begins to change causing a lack of sharpness or even trouble with recall thankfully the breakthrough in privileges helps your brain\nAnd actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in jellyfish in clinical trials president has been shown to improve short term memory ... healthier brain better life\nNow available in stores everywhere in the valley where they ... this product is not intended to treat you prevent any disease\nZero you're listening to the Patriot am eleven fifty [noise]\n\nSo the the ratings are in for cable news last night I don't really folks like to make a big deal with these because we live with Iran and should die by on and we have readings insurance but it was it was a really good night [noise]\nFor the on the show at Fox News in general the bay though that oh what a better or worse town hall\nDidn't even rate as much CNN usually gets it was a bomb that that I say that was\nWell he didn't even get a million viewers on fake news CNN\nWere Rush Limbaugh on with me for the hour we're just shy of foreign million viewers paid oh the big starting over the whole country doesn't want to steal nevermind Texas\nPretty unbelievable story and oil and fake news CNN he's they fail to even call him out for lying about fleeing the scene of an accident while he was wasted you know and or his legalizing narcotics view that was a genius for you\nDon't believe he will be Chuck Schumer it is it was it about an article written I don't know where I saw it um I don't know who this person is Heather Wilhelm\nThe ... the embarrassment the embarrassing spectacle of paid oh mania do you know they sit nearly Seventy million dollars outside of Texas money\nTo unseat Ted Cruz\nIt's unbelievable so I'm proud of them I'm going to be in Houston tomorrow we're going to be following the story\nIt's got to be a town hall I get to participate by the way which was nice\nAnd a Rick Perry's going to be there on behalf of Ted and I'm going to be interviewing both of them and uh it's gonna be in Houston all the details are on Hannity dot com I Hope that our friends Katie are Rachel hope that they can come on out we'd love to see out there\nIt's going to be at the double tree greenway plaza so it'll be eleven AM greenway plaza Houston, Texas\nAnd we're going to be in Beaumont town hall there three thirty Edison plaza all details on Hannity dot com and decided to be there you know but there's one thing is true about this headline is it is an embarrassing spectacle\nYou know and the ... I'm telling you I Am the people or Texas or not going to put up with this\nI Know that people attacks us they're not you know what I think they start early voting on Monday in Texas\nUm so that's coming to to a head I mean barring a disaster I mean it only is is it's like the winds me of Obama in the sense that he's cool oh beta O'Rourke it's it it is they out side taxes phenomenon\nNot attack it only by the way this is New York DC think this is the San Francisco LA thing he gets a full hour on fake news CNN he can't even gone to a million viewers\nThat's all the ... not not just taxes that's the whole country you know we could have put it on short wave radio and TV he could've done a Facebook Live show or Twitter live show and done better than a million\nAnyway so you know then you know Texas by the way we have some examples there of people asking non citizens to register to vote that's now becoming a big problem down in Texas oh by the way even MSNBC held paid or rock is a rock star it can be the twenty twenty nominate\nA yeah try and get through Ted Cruz first good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans I think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us\nFour thousand people strong that want to get to the southern border or the United states from Central America\nI Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen\nI I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update uh apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government that that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what did they resist that they don't want a solution\nFor the board our problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we they now are using these drug cartels\nYou can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using in this I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above so they'll fly from Mexico\nInto the United states along our southern border they fly drones with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's they're most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nAt so evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are\nTo be successful or the president while he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that has been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny\nBut we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor\nAnd any sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process that would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh it wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his like well now they want a nine to one\nBut the way I see it Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight lead now in Florida but it's not big enough\nDo you want if you want rex Rick Scott has killed himself and done such a great job for the state of Florida look at how this man is all hands on deck doesn't sleep every hurricane he's prepared to help out those that are victims\nAmazing I'm maybe the most charisma in the world will be the first to tell you that but you know one thing I'm a little sick of a lot of politicians with a lot of hot air and be asked that talk a good game and just all lying to us\nWhich is part of the whole democratic strategy that's why project very tossed catching reticent on tape and his campaign saying oh yeah well he's just saying he'll support cow but he's not support cab and he's not going to\nBe [laughter] I [laughter]\nI Can't even actually [laughter]\nI

doing saying what they need to say to get elected to just pick up all the same thing Claire McCaskill's exposed doing the same exact thing\nAnd then you think she's more progressive than she left on the already in my mind so she has a lot more or less but my there's no she's a lot more radical\nThan what she says other where there's a story that just broken Claire McCaskill is going to be problematic because see it on Fox News dot com and\nOh it's okay to join or the Taliban no problem what on Arizona's a crazy [noise] otherwise Dean Heller is a very important racy need support in Nevada will continue [noise]\n\nWhat did Jesus said about abusing children no man I mean you will hold the you at a middle stone if you've ever seen a middle stone their gigantic middle stone around
