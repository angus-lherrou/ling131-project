with the Republican camp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and rest musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of

races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are going to make a difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of

help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody in these tight races and an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talked about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative healthcare solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better\nCountry and and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the the pure force of personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know isn't iconoclast I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting then we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share and NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again while you're basically\nIt's your counteracting

thirty million people live there\nA nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea that people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great with therapy for the world and we got a president that's not

this but the son of Obama national security adviser Susan Rice or something happens to be a conservative\nIn fact his name is John rice camera and he's the president of the Stanford University college Republicans and he's now saying that he was assaulted by one of these violent democratic a Democrat protesters during the pro Kavanaugh rally that they had last week\nAnd the Stanford Daily reports that rice Cameron who is the president of the Stanford college Republicans claims that a classmate Belinda Hernandez quote shoved him in the chest with their hand during a verbal disagreement\nOther student news outlets citing a Stamford department of public safety spokesperson said Hernandez was placed under private person arrest at rice Cameron's request and issued a citation for battery\nOther Stanford Daily quoted a law enforcement source saying there's no obvious physical injury to either party involved and rice camera refused evaluation by paramedics Hernandez along with multiple other witnesses dispute that characterization and claim Hernandez merely touched him after he refused to stop\nVideo recording a her without her consent I don't know if you saw the recent video my friend

America great hat God help\nYou in that particular case it doesn't and all of this was being encouraged\nBy the so called leaders of the Democratic party and that's what you that's what we got to understand here this is the modern left the Democratic party there is no vision there's no there's there are no solutions being offered\nThere's a lot of hate being pedaled around a lot of innuendos now we know they're not the party of the constitution and due process and presumption of innocence\nYou know these values have served as well as a country for a long time\nAnd now with a very pathetic and sad and frankly now alarming state and I honestly think that Rand Paul is not off base when he says that this rhetoric is going to lead to somebody getting killed at some point\nWhen Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence they might even live next door to you don't know where these people are when we shouldn't do is incite people to violate the problem is is rational people my back down\nWhat's going to happen when the guy comes with a gun to a rally or comes with a knife to a rally there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nYeah they need to come the rhetoric town but it's not like what are they going to do they're going to go out there and say well we're running on raising your taxes were running an open borders and eliminating ice we're running but as we want to impeach the president we've tried for two years to undermine this man we've had the power of the deep state\nAt levels that well nobody ever thought could be so corrupt you know talking about putting a wire on the president and invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment on the president just because they lost\nYou know and the whole Russia investigation was created by phony smoke and mirrors even lease the page that ... just prior to the appointment of Mahler yeah there was no there there they had nothing on Trump and Russia and any collusion\nSo what did they do well they went to their their strategy which was their plan B which was oh let's let's let's leaked to the media everything in the Clinton bought and paid for Don the a\n... look like it's coming from all these individuals sources and all look like it's real\nAnd what may went into details apparently well they're not going to check about my phone just bring my bone in and I'll just record the president of the United states and maybe we'll say something dumb and we can invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThe same guy that signed the third renewal applications for the buys a warrant\nThat's the fourth buys a warrant the third renewal application all of it based on the pony dusty a in every case abroad committed upon the size of courts and then the same information that we now have learned the media leaks strategy that existed\nJust before it leaves a page that nobody had any evidence of any Trump Russia collusion at all and Peter Struck said that there is no there there at all but now we know what the insurance policy was they had immediately strategy to to create the impression that there was a lot that they had\nWhen in fact it was them leaking to different news sources to create the impression that this was real\nAnd then of course you know uniting what they're good friend Robert Mueller and that's why it's been a witch hunt\nFor whatever Eighteen months the biggest abuse of power ever that pony dusty it used to manipulate not only by sort of court judges and committed brought on them but that information was disseminated before the election so that the American people would buy the lives\nAnd the propaganda and and vote for Hillary oh jeez the hookers in a bad urinating in Moscow we can all like this guy\nAnd then it got used again and again and again they

there\nIt is now the number one best selling history ... series in history and this tells a powerful story and one that I think we really need to always be aware of and that is that evil does exist\nI've talked about this for years it's very hard for good people or genuinely good people people trying to be good people to understand their wrap their arms around the fact that how is it possible that you know communism fascism in in this case that he was writing about ...\nIn the last century a hundred million humans souls destroyed now I couldn't put the book down as it tells the entire story of the\nPost war manhunt for these Nazi war criminals that even takes us to modern day and then it's extraordinarily well researched and I'm I honestly bill I think it's a very hard

anytime you short lived again absolutely\nAnd I'm following you crochet you're on TV and radio\nAnd I wrote this book partly because they wanted Americans should know that is true you ... and that we can't turn away from it because we do we're going to find ourselves down the road facing a situation I wouldn't say it's gonna be Hitler and the third Reich\nBut we're heading toward hate and feet are

all uniting sharing intelligence\nAnd recognizing the evil that is the uranium mullahs chanting death to Israel death to America and fomenting terror the number one state sponsor of terror but meant for mending proxy wars all around the region\nAnd this might be the opportunity to create that piece in the middle East that has been a base of war ever I that's what I see is a potential possibility\nIf there is a possibility there that the Iranian people themselves the Persians will um I've had enough and we'll take out the mothers who are persecuting not only them what anybody else that they don't like\nUm the mullahs and no different than a Third Reich I mean the revolutionary guard in Iran at this moment it's no different than the ss it's the same mentality will kill you and we don't care you're infidels I'm so yes you're right\nThere is an opportunity now I'm going to take a lot of leadership and a lot of guts and um we can't put John Kerry in ...\nIn charge of it a ...

but we have to have to fight and something and and the the radar could have prevented that people respond to I think the ... on the wealth stationed domestically\nAnd so I think maybe they're looking at it saying well maybe when he said how\nAre we going to get a new line but it's never been the case Jonathan I mean that's why we chronicled this every two and four years and I think we saw the worst of the worst with judge Kavanaugh you know immediately I Believe\nI I think people that make serious allegations like was made in the case of professor port they've got to be listened to but she gave the names of people including an eye witness that didn't corroborate their story\nYou you know the problem we're we're we're having now Sean is that we don't just have the same rhetoric that politics have every year we also have activists out there we have from\nDifferent groups like an tougher and are by all means necessary be am in ... these people are actively going out and causing fear and intimidation using violence as we saw in Portland, Oregon when you combine all these things\nThe the rhetoric the violence the on the ground in your face type of stuff is there going in intimidating the politicians and ah then speakers when they're out eating what you're seeing is an escalation far beyond just rhetoric which we've had before and even when you have somebody like Dr Ford given testimony it gets mass\nGets covered up whether it's serious or real there's evidence or not this stuff gets so covered up by a motion um and that it's gotten completely out of control now to a point where\nUh there there is no truth I mean you look at these statements that Eric Holder made you can't double speak you can't say kick people and then say let's not do anything illegal that's double speak\nBut then you know this has been your party name one thing that the your Democratic Party you're below party is offering the American people besides impeachment endless investigations keeping the failure of Obamacare wanting the crumbs back of the tax cut open borders eliminating ice what what what are they going to do for the\nMen and women in this country um after eight years of failure with Brock Obama what are they gonna what are they offering what are they running on except hatred\nDifferent again I I take great and conditions Medicare and Medicaid Medicare that environment or they don't want to know\nAre they gonna do they had eight years uh Brock Hussein Obama as president\nThirteen million more Americans on and on food stamps have moved more poverty accumulated more debt than every other president before him combined the lowest labor participation rate since the Nineteen seventies and the only president in history never to reach a three percent GDP GDP Growth than a year\nHad that they had the football they they they ran backwards the country went backwards now we got eight million Americans out of poverty for a million or food stamps\nFor a

Jonathan what is it\nYou know something that you just said a second ago about it how long ago George Bush was\nIn office and they're still talking about this what I what I hear you saying when I don't hear Daniel saying or any liberals for that matter\nIs the fact that we're here and now and there's things that have to be fixed now we can reflect on the past eight years because it just occurred and we're still suffering from that but we we have rhetoric in Washington DC that is not trying to fix anything and in fact it is if\nThey are trying the Democratic party is trying to crush or the will of the American people so they can go after the constitution get rid of the electoral college change their numbers Supreme Court justices ridiculous stuff like that and it's\nHow do you become a party that doesn't even believe in simple due process the constitution presumption of innocence how you know how how do you become a party that has now noted for\nYou you know people in your party

doing over the past year about all the stuff they have to do with the Russia investigation all that if you did a list on your show of all the things that the Democratic party is trying to do to get away from the way we live the constitution due process all these things\nI think people would be shocked at how much they are trying to get us away from that the founding fathers instilled into the constitution it's shocking\nHow how do you run on the idea that I Want you know the tax cuts the largest in history putting a thousand two thousand dollars and and the average family's pocket in this country that's real money for real families\nThe first pay raise they've had since like Nineteen Ninety in terms of real dollars and ... they call it oh those are just crumbs but they want the crumbs back\n[laughter] I I'm not going to agree with that sorry [laughter]\nAnd what are they fighting for health care health care keeping Obamacare jobs from putting Trump is the one that got the jobs we didn't have any jobs under Obama\nHe asked down he took it from the ...\nOh okay but he put thirty million more Americans on food stamps and eight million more in poverty\nAnd the years in the ... okay yeah eight years to fix that meant Trump is done all the years that's the point has\nThat kind of plan then you have to spank kind of planet\nRight anyway westward are good for you know it doesn't go\nYou know showing you been doing this for a walk I'm over Thirty years he's been doing that and I've never heard a worst phone then [laughter] and then you'll McLaughlin\nAnd Internet than

the middle of his wife was out doing law enforcement you weren't integrated into all this politics\nHave you yourself ever seen ... uh the Democratic party ever leave any sense of normalcy of what this country is all about I mean I remember when Reagan was in office the Democratic\nWay only thing I Would say is that when Newt Gingrich came to power every member was right after the the Clinton care fiasco they tried to do socialized medicine didn't work out the Republicans when they took power Clinton was smart enough and I think through the advice of people like Dick Morris and others\nTo move to more to the center right\nAnd we were able to get to a balanced budget it was one the Republicans put together they finally got Bill Clinton signed it\nAnd it worked but it was more of a political necessity than any any principles that that he held deeply liberalism is a failed law the ideology that never works\nIt seems great on paper free health care free they care free free free you know if\nWe got this guy running out the Gavin Newsom in California free everything for everybody whether you're a citizen and non citizen\nFree health care for anybody in California you don't

surrounded by technology you right now Sean but you had the benefit of growing up at a time when your formative years you how to learn how to have conversations face to face when you know I was

Bush didn't care about black people because of the way he handles Hurricane Katrina now the left\nHates him because he is embracing the president and saying to black people take a look at this guy substantively rather than automatically being always on the side of the Democrats I spoke with the president and a couple of weeks ago and suggested he talked to kind of a gym round the football great and Tiger Woods the grave\nSo that's why it or don't told Trump to bring these guys in the eye shut and all and I should have known Geraldo told Trump to get Kanye West and Aaron John Brown and\nTiger tiger hasn't been yet but you know that Geraldo did bring up a a ... I forgot it was\nKanye West who told George W. Bush\nThat\nHe didn't think he cared about black people because Hurricane Katrina boy that remember when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans the left was out there saying that Bush wanted\nBlacks in Louisiana New Orleans to be hurt so that they would leave and go to Texas or someplace to lessen the strength of the Democratic party in Louisiana they were out there saying that the Bush also a was able to steer the hurricane and that\nBush was responsible for the Lebanese being weak because he didn't hold people accountable when they didn't spend the money or the ... that was Kanye West so can you hear all kinds of crab back then in two thousand five rip it in divorce\nThey loved him but the love\nWas sleeping obviously be right\nBack to\nRussia ... we were\nWhen my cardiologist told me I needed to take a stab rum to lower my cholesterol he also told me that it can lower my natural levels of ...\nHe told me to take ... yeah\nThe number one cardiologist recommended form of co Q. ten a very important nutrient for healthy heart healthy blood pressure levels Juno with three times better absorption has the number one cardiologist recommended form of ... take to know the better cook you tend\nTo not ten nine central long ABC finish the sentence for millennia Trump is the first lady the interview Ken women in the me too movement call you a supporter no question off limits you're not the first first lady to\nHave to deal with her husband's alleged infidelity has just put a strain on your marriage to not one of them along the Trump say let's talk about the ... why did you were being along the ABC exclusively about don't miss it tonight at ten nine central on ABC\nTo Rush Limbaugh on the patriots am eleven fifty [noise]\n\nBy the way getting out of here and want to want to welcome back [noise] everybody in Panama City that is able to listen to the radio the E R B network utilized\nA helicopter and satellite dish to get the broadcast tower and facilities of our Panama City affiliate back up and running already that's W F L F F am or Ninety four point five and it's great to have them all ready back\nUm and by the way what is really happening what a play ... James O'Keefe is going to join us and the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there him and his campaign of his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people at Tennessee\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it's not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play for you later in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing that people have zero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe and the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all oh wait do we get to the tape on cinema today\nOr you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester\nIs they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington but then when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that's the first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nFrankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering\nSolutions and the answers and solving problems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes\nWell that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever\nTo never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs so never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings in fact not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what ... what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and when they tell him well you know it's costing us\nYou know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... because of that regulation of the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that he challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody is that all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House listen very closely what ... was saying and I'm like why do we think we need some prison reform I'll give me an example\nWhen the president ... commuted the sentence of ... marine Johnson remember the woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug offense\nA grandmother apparently she'd run in a horrible economic difficulties at like ... there's no one knew on some times in our criminal justice system\nAnd we spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interviewer I absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her\nRight into the arms of her loving family I got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen and then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the Alice Murray Johnson's in prison that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that maybe but given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York while I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred three or four hundred Bernie Carrick was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes of being committed where the shots being fired wherever it\nAnd to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night and not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows in the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done at this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary I our our human\nOur human family in talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable\nWe can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better\nAnd then he's talking about bringing jobs are making the things in America and creating jobs in America you know they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed\nAnd we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAnd why as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that it's downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness\nIt's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious viable thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when they grow don't read flat folks\nAren't that his he just praying Kanye West and the racial draft now all of a sudden ... because he put on a nod hats and he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the models folks person he's he's the token negro of as of the Trump administration's\nThis was an embarrassment Conyers mother is rolling over in her very\nI think you had there man has clearly not OK and a president who is willing to accept boy that\nWas a combination of stream of consciousness I felt like I sit in on a psychiatric ...\nAnd a commercial for Donald Trump on the question of of of mental health on the question of other quoting him I felt very pointed to me I never something very fragile valid and to add about kind of pulling out of the phone and France like Titanic as colorfully outside I think for his arrows and pulling up somewhere picture of a ... I mean\nJust to expand on that it seems like an important point I haven't\nHeard anyone else on television make at that but I think we had\nA sauce whole play by play and political announces here not because that was her fault on our White House\nI'm just going to be honest I may get a lot of trouble for it I feel actually full bad for him what I saw was a menstrual show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself\nTo this is white supremacy by ring true of course I'm a black mouth is moving with white racist ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiles\nKanye West is engaging in one of the most and the various practices and yet all black body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of anti black sentiments that have been shown shaped by people with far more rigorous credentials\nIt is so vicious and vile I don't even know where to begin\nHow was that acceptable to anybody this I don't know Kanye except I've talked to him twice in my life\nAnd we talked about safer cities like the city of Chicago we talked about economic empowerment and opportunity for people for everybody in this country he's a billionaire\nAnd he is an attack on that vicious horrible level\nI don't even know what to say my friend Heisman\nTrophy winning football great Herschel Walker he's called out CNN's Don Lemon for

James okay we've found our project beret toss it's up on Hannity dot com project baritone dot com or we got to take a quick break here when we come back\nOr news roundup information overload are we going to look at the polls and all the major races with our pollster John McLaughlin Doug shown and believe it or not the Republican candidate for governor in California has a shot these within five points is it possible because we really shocked the world will get into that more as we continue [noise]\n\nTotally\nGentle giants dog food Batman I Burt Ward Robin from Batman would you like your dogs live as long as twenty seven healthy active years my wife and I created gentle giants dog food and our special feeding and tear programs\nTo help all dogs and puppies live longer healthier lives dogs eating gentle giants are living his longest twenty seven healthy active years twice their normal lifespan now with Wal Mart or ask your local retailer learn more gentle giants dog food dot com Hi\nRace with makes Sally in cinema well that's Mick Sally now is up in the latest poll there by six\nAnd that's before the release of the tape that we showed last night\nOf cinema in twenty eleven calling the people of Arizona that she wants to vote for her\nCrazy I don't think that's going to go over well nor do I think it's going to go over well that she invited this this radical attorney to Arizona State university ... a university a lawyer convicted of aiding and abetting an Islamic terror organization and its leader\nIn the lawyer in question represented someone who was one sentence to life in prison\nOr sent a sentence for in the nineties for blowing up a plotting to blow up the UN and FBI building so I think a cinema is going to see a dramatic drop in the polls there and I think things will look up for Martha ... he was a rock star a person who has served her country with incredible distinction\nUm and here to go through all these latest numbers and what it means and whether or not a this is gonna be the blue wave or is it going to be a shock the world twenty sixteen Donald Trump all over redux\nA we have our good friends John McLaughlin and dug shown is with us welcome both the back to the program\nThank you thank you I I don't think there's any doubt the cabinet overreach\nAnd the loss of due process and and even simple principles like the presumption of innocence has now definitely hurt the Democratic party I think these tapes of bread a sin and in Tennessee and cinema in Arizona are gonna hurt those candidacies\nAnd when you have thirty two house seats really you know going to tip the balance one way or the other which way does it go John McLaughlin\nWhile I ... I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you got a notice this week you noticed the market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations have businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again and that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations and\nWhat they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I can agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened\nWith the backlash of about the whole cabinet are hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down right and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have pulled their because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is if you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your closer to raise taxes take what you got to take away the jobs take away the pay raises\nAnd the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has a she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country\nSo these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play or Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold it she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nShown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet\nBut the house but I think the Senate you have to have been looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort but those as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know they ... they want to get rid of ice that won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average has gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively in that direction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of New York I have\nNoticed which is a pretty hard core left wing state even a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that\nI Know but if I got\nI got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat it is not me and it stems cells are streaming or write to\nMe was that there are actually are conservative you know so they noticed that it's not because\nIt's simple no one is Hans within a rifle no one me\nUh I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nI'm Sorry but there's no places for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be governor governor the love and vote for one's me out of town\nSo I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think that you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice would like to run for I think my friend John and I can\nI ... well you disabuse our friend Doug of any notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kit for Franklin square you're still you're still am working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it Doug folding out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\n... I heard it oh yeah yeah I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him because he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's gotta get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as John says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back where the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world\nAre we we we are basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be gotten governed have control of their own healthcare\nBut but if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you do oh\nI Want democratic candidates at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal racist acts like she should go period style\nAbsolutely and and does point about in previous times or have been on the radio as you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again what's the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time\nWhat should you should be better stop Nancy Pelosi from getting\nWell I think it's got to be not I I think look if you if you like the success of the last\nTwo years if you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you if\nYou believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in the health care plan the free independent market healthcare plan that actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers\nThat we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh over all of those messages and constitutional originalists on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\nYep but you can put all those issues and one vessel and personalize it because Nancy Pelosi will take away all those things show reverse it will have fewer jobs show raise taxes ... you'll have open borders you won't have security\nAs we can say you were shown and\nJohn McLaughlin are posters just twenty five days from election day um besides running on endless investigation\nAn impeachment and wanting their crumbs back and wanting to keep Obamacare and wanting to eliminate ice and open borders [noise] can you name one policy that Democrats are running on that would help the American people Doug ...\nMake sure that health care is covered for those with a\n... by the way Donald Trump is saying the same thing\nIt's just the Republican Party has not been a sensitive to the issue as the Democrats but I I got another issue Charlotte\nThey're all saying hold onto a Obamacare So\nWell come my way of thinking what they should say is no below sea no impeachment of Kavanaugh no impeachment of Trump just work on issues like\nCompromise on immigration compromise on health care and continued choice in education\nNow let me tell you if they if they would listen to that which they never will because they're not a moderate party that would absolutely pretty much wrap it up for the house in my opinion\nI agree Sean where I'm the same page John too I have your support to work with Sean when we find a state or nation for him to run in for the highest\nThat are very weaken the body does not gonna yes or no he could run out and I got ... ...\n... your ... your way by the way we're checking out your high school yearbook right now\n[laughter] I have never looked at us I have no idea what the hell am I guy\nI Know you're not exactly run up to the Supreme Court but if if no check out\nThose are the half of my junior my junior and senior year I was tending bar to four thirty in the morning a lotta nights and\nYou know I was just I I didn't show up half the time so that's probably a good thing people don't even recognize that I went there with lots of witnesses yeah I'm sure there as well we'll dig 'em up somewhere from forty years ago uh All right John McLaughlin and Doug Jones thank you both for being with us [noise]\n\nThe only thing the Democrats have get rid of Republicans' biggest power is ours all of this nature to panic hysteria and paranoia\nFrom people who are convinced that their rights so convinced that America agrees with that so convinced of the American people want them back in power wire them all of this range and paranoia and anger\nRush Limbaugh he's in the mornings and not on the Patriot am eleven fifty\nTwos I'm rich Dennison American pastor Andrew Brunson is left turkey fried today after two
