I\nLived through hurricane Michael as it slammed the shore Wednesday near Panama City Florida\nA north easterly turned a it'll be a little south of Atlanta\nAnd if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael and it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast\nThrough Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect at that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline tap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher um over a million power outages we expected occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is gonna be a significant threat into the Carolinas so uh everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina if you're in North Carolina\nYou know you can make their preparations now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you pack the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers with everybody in in harm's way today this was this was the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's gonna be this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's going to be the worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida\nThat's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth would the most generous people on earth\nAnd whatever our friends in Florida Georgia the Carolinas they're going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he was involved and think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person in May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me\nHe is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew all the fourth Pfizer\nApplication to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now or the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for\nPhony Russian dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact it was anything but a legal expense\nNow he was now are supposed to testify because three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week James Baker now the third person are all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office\nTaping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse over the terms of the testimony\nBecause lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional taskforce interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aide said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president\nThe hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talked about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he signed off on a document himself talked about what was in regards to fight assume warrants you know that as an affidavit and career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nIf there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it\nThey knew the DNC paid for it they knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the ... was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents and when questioned in in in Iraq a tour and Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially fights application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information pertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said\nWell first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Wal Mart but also said that Hillary should win them a hundred million is zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... operation of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that you have people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation\nLisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tax confirmed that there is no there there but anyway then they start ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA and it creates an ...\nRod Rosenstein will testify Greg Jarrett damn mancino much more all coming up stay with us\n[noise]\nPush for a new car or we can remain free health community out term

they can sign because that's what a hamburgers all about\nYou are listening to the ... the ... eleven fifty\n[laughter] sort of them are lemon what's new today on the free I her radio\nFor decorating the house or just setting the theory ... hurricane\nNow slamming the panhandle of Florida Panama City exactly where we told you it was going to hit we have guts of a hundred and Seventy five eighty miles per hour storm surge up to thirty feet\nA and the center is hitting hard in theory is and passed just their job is already a predicted since Sunday and his forecast and on this program yesterday and he joins us now from whether bell dot com the official meteorologist at the Sean Hannity show um everything you said and more um cat\nFor maybe borderline cat five\nYeah landfall now it's it's inland now thirty to forty miles and we want to give you said at the track of this is going to be very uh right through middle Georgia or they're very close to making Warner robins about two am this morning mirror Augusta tomorrow morning and near and south of the track for instance it looks like wind gusts\nAre going to be a hundred two hundred and twenty miles an hour in southwest Georgia\nProbably uh Seventy five a hundred miles an hour middle Georgia around the Augusta area the strongest winds are probably going to be between a sixty and eighty miles an hour near in southeast of Augusta\nAnd in Columbia say fifty five Seventy five near in southeast of there so the track of this by tomorrow night\nUh will take it or to take it probably a north of Fayetteville North Carolina and then two AM in the morning it reaches the uh reaches a lizard at city North Carolina and then it goes out\nSo that's how we're expecting this to move a over the next twenty four thirty six hours and so it's going to be moving pretty quickly or through a lot of these areas\nLet me go there's a little bit more of a first of all I mean the the governor saying I Hope to God that nobody said then people evacuated on the coast I'm not so sure that that's the case I mean I'm looking at some of these images and it's it's downright scary flooding has already occurred in in some of these coastal areas\nUm but the the these are the types of wins that could blow down houses correct and and structure\nI suspect you're not seeing any any uh video coming in from where this made landfall ... I mean it's one thing for instance at Pensacola is on the west side of this and mobile Pensacola has had a wins out the north forty ... sixty but it's blowing out\nSo it's at Panama City area a port saint Joe that's the area where it's ground zero and that you know if you told me structures and I'm not just talking about the you know a small structure I'm Talking about a Camille took apartment buildings out along the beach show\nEither saying listen first storm Joe is the most powerful on record to ever hit the Florida Panhandle\nRight between mobile in Tampa this is the most powerful record you know\nA at that also goes ... Camille once you get ... you get Camille in there about past Chris John and those places that are ... a benchmark storm there and done and Charlie down south of Tampa or the benchmark storms there of course Andrew in Miami\nOr they're Nineteen twenty six was a bad storm along the coast but it was only a category three\nUp near Pensacola no this is this is the worst the worst storm now when we get a look folks to the east of the tracks severe weather tornadoes are going to break out tonight into tomorrow and we're talking on southern and eastern\nWhen you weigh in east of the ... you're talking now about the Georgia but it's going to be a little south of Atlanta a direct kind of hit an eighty hundred miles an hour I'm guessing into Augusta\nWell no I think I think Augustus is sixty to eighty maybe Ninety miles now it'll back off by them making making like I said it may get us as high as that southwest Georgia where it's going to be entering into a couple of hours they're going to be seen as a hundred hundred and twenty miles an hour and got in\nThere I mean that that's phenomenal because you've got to understand folks as powerful as these things are when they get inland fractional effects or it's almost like if you if you're running a nine one a sprint nine one one hundred yard dash if you tweak your hamstring\nIf you can't run that fast if you really pull it you can't run at all well these things have perfect machines\nBut once they get inland fractional affects the fact that they're moving away from the source of energy the water they ... they wind down but we're talking about a relative winding down how many times as a ...

I Believe now firmly that you know all the people that have been claiming a blue wave a blue wave and blue wave can be shocked again just like they weren't twenty sixteen and they were only a couple of us that believe that that was even possible\nAnd ah I think one indicator of just how far left the Democratic party has gone is out in California the sanctuary state of California and you have Gavin knows new sitting running up against his business guy by the name of what was his first name John Cox\nNon ... and and Cox is now in a five point almost within the margin race against Gavin Newsom and one of the biggest issues to emerge is not only the sanctuary cities status of the whole state but\nThe proposal of gab a nuisance to provide free health care to anybody does it matter is you know resident California citizen non citizen does it matter everybody gets free health\nCare who can look out and everybody's us who have ... just ...

David together Pfizer warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out with the third renewal Pfizer application in the case of Carter Page a which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the phone eight Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked\nWhich is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller and now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as in past continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also of Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nAll the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney at the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions for Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of United States\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think you're saying is uh Shaun is is I let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nOf twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest

Meadows All right so the next step that is what I mean do we do I need to give out the numbers of Trey Gowdy is office\nAnd chairman Goodlatte office and say call these men and demand that they subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why that would be any hesitation considering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third ...\nThere's a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell hopefully I I Would I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number and your grade holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it you're listening interest and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today\nOr to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that\nThe deputy attorney general much caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI have not uh Shaun we need to see that we need to see it and don't take an after every time roots or goes in and talks with yeah yeah I remember Mr or told us\nThat after each conversation he had with Glenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact person at the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we went to see all those notes of all those conversations we know there are at least twelve of those\nSo the so called real too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications for Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include my number so we we need all that information\nAnd again it's it's a real good sign that read it and you get talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see it more important the American people need to see\nWhat do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please too old to two to five six oh three oh a chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past\nWith the Republican Party with your intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides you just you know the if the phobic foe before kind of stuff these identity politics can easily Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean and a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work in a back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior in a fight or in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a\nWe may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen to them and looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Garrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend and and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise] um and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America\nThat this was a process of the confirmation hearing that was a massive amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is redundant\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnish state just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is then they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin all cases\nAnd frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the and you chronicled lives in your new book you know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host\nAt a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this rage ... not all of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe's been he's been called trees is they've jammed up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left and I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen\nWhen is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and Kavanaugh you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's space and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nAh the investigation and teach men of Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how in a legal basis impeachment is not possible\nOr for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals' and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to run the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which you've been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than ... Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity 'em and add money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I did like Kevin McCarthy introduced which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point it is it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age and the health of some of the justices that there is no doubt that will be vacancies in the in years to come in the\nNear future yeah and don't forget shown that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell you most of these cases that are ... important to American businesses American individuals\nMoms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to have to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat a you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection bid may come open\nI ... and I say the Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if it gets very decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's gonna happen if that seat comes open as a potential\nSix three conservative majority and the courts\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at it and again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen I quit\nOne eight hundred two hundred seven four zero to\n\nContinue with Greg Jared and dare mancino both of you been following in the ... part of a ... group of us is not a lot of us\nFollowing all of the deep state movements\nNow the issue today we just had on Mark Meadows in Jim Jordan talking about a Rod Rosenstein is now saying he doesn't want to appear before the a house Judiciary Committee on the issues are before them\nAnd that is the latest one that Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker of all said that that Rod Rosenstein or talked about surreptitiously taping the president\nOf the United states in the hopes of getting something on tape but that might invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment those are the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict\nHaving written a letter and recommended the firing a James call me the same guy the signed the fourth and final buys a warrant that we should have an redacted and released the American people that hasn't happened yet and the same guy that appointed Robert Mueller\nAh why wouldn't you want to testify Greg Jared under oath\nWell he doesn't want to transcribe the interview or anything under oath or which chairman Goodlatte and others are demanding why\nIf it's not recorded or not under oath Rosenstein can do what he always does\nDeceive and lie with impunity without putting in self in legal jeopardy show what Rosenstein really watches oh you know Mr ... let's just you and I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit too if Rosenstein or to lie as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement of Congress she's not looking at\nPerjury because he can always deny the conversation ... good ... remembers the which which is why this is so critically important\nOr they've got to do that and they shot a subpoena him and they've got a demand to show up and they've got to put them under oath and these answers have given but\nUh I got to let you bought so do the right great job Greg Jared congrats on the successor the

you must not set of loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so it was actually is that we put it out publicly with a patriot owes\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning telling people that it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks the first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay so you could see this coming you could see the whole pattern come back at you know we talk\nOn a on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of a big golf store right now you said it right on the show I Know\nYeah right right on the show and you could see the pattern setting up for this\nEverything got together and that's why and you see that every once in a while but let me put it in perspective yes is the worst storm ever to hit between mobile camp I that I can find on records okay now you know whether the ten thousand years ago something hit worse so we're not going to sugarcoat that\nBut on the other hand it's not because of your SUV All right this is what nature is capable of doing and you can see this pattern setting up\nPretty far in advance it's also one of only a handful of storms the last twenty five years including Harvey by the way that hit at its peak Andrew did that Camille did that I was in at its peak when it came into Florida was weakening off it's the\nMost of these hurricanes have we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties that hit on their peak now as far as the storm it's as if it made landfall\nAs a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they go out to go in and look at the damage but there's a lot more or less of this storm folks\nBecause even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in the central Georgia that that'd be ... to one Seventy five but they're going to be ... to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour\nAt

done a phenomenal job or as it relates to you know the state\nOf Wisconsin in ... I Hope the people of Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close\nA we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican camp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and rats musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota I Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana that can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana I think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think Marsha

house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ... important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are gonna make a difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives\nI mean because of gerrymandering above big portion and percentage of seats I ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats\nSo we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody in these tight races and an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera\nWere just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class but I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting then we're not winning\nAnd when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again well you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made I was trying to do which is prevent a hospital regime from ever having the power to turn off the ticket and turn off the light blood of western Europe's economy\nIt's just simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and that little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea\nYou know you look over the the DMZ and what do you see

it on the Fox news channel it was an ad out there\nIt is now the number one best selling history ... series in history and this tells a powerful story and one that I think we really need to always be aware of and that is that evil does exist\nI've talked about this for years it's very hard for good people or genuinely good people people trying to be good people to understand their wrapped their arms around the fact that how\nIs it possible that you know communism fascism in in this case that he was writing about ... in the last century a hundred million humans souls destroyed now I couldn't put the book down as it tells the entire story of the\nPost war manhunt for the Nazi war criminals that\nEven takes us to modern day and then it's extraordinarily well researched and I'm I honestly

have you very a very troubling anytime you short lived again absolutely\nAnd I'm following you closely on TV and radio\nAnd I wrote this book partly because I wanted Americans should know that truly evil exists and that we can't turn away from it because we do we're going to find ourselves down the road facing a situation I wouldn't say it's gonna be Hitler and the third Reich\nBut we're heading toward hate and fear dominating the country you know and you can see it you see what happened a cabin on the attacks on me and you see what antifa is doing you see people walking into schools gunning

Bill O'Reilly is with us the book is called killing the ss\nAnd I kind of consider myself of World War two history buffs in a in a sense my dad fought in World War two\nAnd what I liked it I learned from the book was post World war two after the fall of the third Reich and and then you had British Israeli American all these intelligence forces working together to apprehend the likes of Adolf Eichmann and\nJoseph ... and all these other you know brutal thugs evil murderers and uh and that whole search was a pretty fascinating thing and it went on for years\nYou know we got a after he wrote chilling Jesus we had a foreign Martin new garden I I'm a nice relationship with the Israeli government and we went back to them for killing the fashion they opened up some of their massage files and nobody had ever seen before um and we got information about the track down\nOf a man and a main ally and Klaus Barbie that nobody else has ever seen they have been secret all these years did you know that ... to butcher of early on in France\nHeaded the Bolivian Secret Service and that's actually a secret police and he was responsible for tracking down and murdering\nShade war vohra unbelievable\nIt was right hand man those are the kinds of things that are all over killing the ss so if people are interested in history they're interested in in this Holocaust which every American and the younger people don't know anything about it so by this book read it and then slap it into the hands of some twenty two year old\nAnd yeah I mean I've got to\nTell you one thing but go ahead there's something happening in history we have a moment to thread the needle like we've never had before and out of fear of Iranian had Gemini we have an unprecedented alliance that is emerging the United states Israel our closest closest ally in the middle east\nThe Jordanians the Egyptians the Saudis are putting the side of the issues with Saudi Arabia today\nAnd the Emirates and they're all uniting sharing intelligence and recognizing the evil that is the uranium mullahs chanting death to Israel death to America and fomenting terror the number one state sponsor of terror\nBut meant for mending proxy wars all around the region\nAnd this might be the opportunity to create that piece in the middle East that has been a base of war ever I that's what I see is a potential possibility\nThere is a possibility there that the Iranian people themselves the Persians will um I've had enough and we'll take out the Mueller's who are persecuting not only them what anybody else that they don't like\nUm the mullahs and no different than a Third Reich I mean the revolutionary guard in Iran at this moment it's no different than the south it's the same mentality will kill you and we don't care you're infidels I'm so yes you're right\nThere is an opportunity now I'm going to take a lot of leadership and a lot of guts and um we can't put John Kerry in ...\nIn charge of it a ... so just cannot put the\nLaws just sense of humor since I've\n... yeah I Know now it's Long Island thing you know\nNow well listen I I'm very impressed with the book a whole series is impressive

is it\nYou know something that you just said a second ago about how long ago George Bush was\nIn office and they're still talking about this what I what I hear you saying when I don't hear Daniel
