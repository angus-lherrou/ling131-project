point you in the wrong direction and I get that that can be scary but doing nothing is not an option either because that becomes a decision\nOr that's passive and in that passage decision you end

ready to show you when you're ready to receive it\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm [noise]\n\nMm\nYeah I'm In\nBy Dianne Feinstein this woman Debra cats for professor Ford remember she was actually recommending Deborah cats while she was meeting privately with Brett Kavanaugh but not telling Brett Kavanaugh about any of these allegations whatsoever member that\nAnyway well Deborah Katz is the one that well she didn't really believe Paula Jones and she did take Al Franken side\nAnd you know ... as you know you just got to watch this it there's no end to this now they are not going to stop until they get a no vote on Brecht capital\nThat's just this this should not surprise anybody and Jeff Flake is now in Massachusetts today trying to run for president thinking he's going to which by the way is the way to do it you don't like Trump go beat him\nIn thirty six days Democrats they'll make their case and they're going to ask you to give the house of representatives to Nancy Pelosi in the Senate Democrats\nTo Chuck Schumer if that's what you want on election night in thirty six days and you want to turn on the TV and find out the results it'd be a stay home well you'll get the government you deserve we always do\nYou want all progress that we have now achieved and two years to stop that will happen too\nBut all the senators saying well no no no we got to limit the scope it it's got to be very quick expeditious and just have the FBI do this that's not what they ever intended they want this to drag on through the mid term elections in the hope that Donald Trump doesn't get to make is Supreme Court nomination\nAnyway joining us now is Carrie Severino\nShe's the chief counsel policy director for the Judicial Crisis network a welcome back to the program well as predicted the bar has shifted\nAnd now the Democrats won an extensive FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor Ford there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now all four of them probably work\nI'd I'd sure they were it was either find people because they already had that interview\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee like the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult\nTo believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to hire an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she works at that every Democrat that that now they're going up the Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI are actually gonna be it's horrible part is an organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's\nLifelong reputation here on the line [noise]\nTake your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever he'll you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will forever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on it you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to get simply use that as their case is counted the name of discount them because they disagree with them anyway\nAn atheist someone who does can an incredible amount of respect\nOn the bench judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit at a lower court catch\nThe Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times like what the fourteen different times they found out\nThey vindicate his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but I like it\nOr if the parents of reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely sunny\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's pack in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so\nIts own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the ... in the bureau special agents have all said to me\nEver ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but\nThe FBI is is blocked the FBI people I Know what the fault of the earth people and I should of course I'd want to help them he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the FBI didn't think he was lying to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says if you look in his company coming and low right now it's just to try to destroy the Trump with everything he can and his mother another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to like the FBI is the one that that it's a crime to lie to the Senate and they're with their debts get it it's not just you know a similar penalty if exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not\nI'm Glad to be here every day thank you for giving me the microphone\n[laughter] I'm basically all I Want it to say is is the obvious\nThis of this whole case is that um Ford\nIs perfectly willing to do to judge Kavanaugh what she has accused him of doing it to her assaulting or a him on a daily basis with this false statements diverse and and just so much fake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue in and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled us including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves\nShe gave the names of four people and none of the fork in corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it at that point\nThey were really you can't go any further with it and he adamantly denies it so it's um it's a matter of just simple okay if somebody corroborated it we'd be in a very different position today I got to take a quick break final half hour\nFree for all

people are pretty pissed off at the\nAt what's you know it was two weeks ago yesterday and nobody had heard one bad thing about Brecht capital\nUntil two weeks ago yesterday and look where we are getting Tucker welcome to the show\nThanks Sean well yeah I mean look cap now is being destroyed not because if anything he did or didn't do that because he's in the way\nOf the Democrats retaining power it's not personal it's just the party wants what he's about to get and so they're crushing him and his family in order to get it\nAre we moving to a revolution while I don't know look at the people in charge look at the Congress look at our media they're pushing conflict in division on us they're pushing racial division endlessly\nThey're pushing gender division they're claiming that the cap not soccer and women should have men and vice versa yeah I mean they're pushing this unity because this unified country it's easier for them\nTo control that divide and conquer it's my oldest strategy there\nWell you don't look I I've I've chronicled this historically over the course of my career and that is it's pretty predictable every two and four years every election cycle Republicans racist sexist I won't get the whole list but exactly they want to throw granny over the cliff\nAnd now with Supreme Court justices or if they have an opening ... there seems to be no ... it's ... there's nothing they won't say or do now I mean your friends of the attorney for professor cats\nYou know Dianne Feinstein recommended who herself is pretty radical left\nNow soliciting people from the Georgetown Prep community whatever that is\nAnd asking if if they have information or they want to come forward their soliciting people and the FBI now is being told by Democrats well it's got to be white in scope and it's got to go on for as long as need be which is the opposite of the so called agreement\nBetween a senator Coons and not enough in order of ... like last week\nExactly I mean

original guys there was an amazing show it it's fun\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those types of shows and doing things that people want a mock now but I'm In any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation\nA number one for sale where conservatives we have a moral compass if we if we do detect that there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one okay that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found\nThat being said it's an opportunity for the Republicans do investigate further in turn the lens on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use that power to investigate everything that's going on here\nAnd potentially witness was being coached ally people being put forward to sign false affidavits\nThere's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the public as we're going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't think it look if we're going to be fair if they really cared about the issue then they'd be asking ah what about Keith Ellison and why would they supportive of Bill Clinton where's Juanita broader FBI investigation\nThey don't want any of these things

not recall Julie sweating it another of the friends she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nRight twenty five now till the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing after all this was was absolute how does this task for news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago\nYou would things you can stay consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a ... a systemic party culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up outside the room waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that this happened thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that than we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air\nByron York is joining us he's been writing is a lot of columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote now you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron hey Sean listen on this on this NBC thing I think everybody's got to be of two minds\nA warrant on the basis of their lack of evidence and\nUh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bought it was given in part a but due to the news networks um thing about Michael I have an eddy her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre there just was nothing to this story um and when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one hit the writer who she was\nAnother was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gone to damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom

Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nOr the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and

I think is a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her\nHer country with incredible honor and distinction and and Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but these numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy I suppose that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nLet it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive the enthusiasm gap is as close to almost two dead even hold\nAnd you see Republicans and important Senate races down a dead heat in all of the states that are red states where we're Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to do stage further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they ... they did a thing you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial a Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process\nHe may well have crippled his party for a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things they're called Republicans and there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats\nAnd he said to me I just don't think people are Americans are going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we've been living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this with certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever ... nature of politics they could bring up comes up every election year but they have now son to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor Ford there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nIt took to look for anything parenthetically that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talked to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the witness said that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just going to jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's enough allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of decayed I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what did he just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks with any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I found it painful\nUm he he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you a pin the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly uh\nBecoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created four million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states\nUh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high and we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe they don't even know their name is\nWell he has put your finger on the key question of this election I have as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and\nOne of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls show me the three sinks I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote\nBecause that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back to the special in one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience with this is going to come down to isn't holding it isn't conversation at the coffee shop\nWho cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up at boat\nAnd if our side does show up in both I think this could be one of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would throw us behind\nThe scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before\nYou became speaker of the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and and you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they're either going to seek hippie happy liberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee\nAnd that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes will go up open borders will remain an Obamacare stays all this or they're going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and being the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I look I mean I think what would I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody cares what's country's future make sure you vote makes sure your friends votes make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm I'm not quite ready yet to predict what am I going to tell you that\nBecause of the intensity of anger\nAbout the way the liberal smear Kavanaugh the characterization the dishonesty I Believe we have seen and I've been looking at data for three days I Believe that we've seen a substantial shift\nTowards Republicans now I think that they were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our or the total number of senators by significant margins\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who's down eleven is no on Kavanaugh to me put a fork in that race it's over\n[noise] yeah well again I think Kramer and it was a great great guy and I've known for twenty four years and he got to get out there and keep campaigning I mean one one of the lessons you know I I had very close races including couple recounts I had very big raised my experiences\nAnd I said it's every candidate do not quit 'til the polls closed and do not relax until the recount are so\nHigher cap per job bringing the powerful touring good versus evil decrease

I Will say this if we allow this to get rewarded and they get power as a result of this or\nLook when we're not going to know till Saturday of impact judge Kavanaugh is confirmed and\nYou know I I Hope Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are satisfied I Know who Susan Collins so she was satisfied with the FBI report and Jeff Flake said the same thing I don't know where Lisa Murkowski is she has not spoken publicly as of now but I Hope we don't reward this behavior because if we do\nTo me it becomes a tipping point in the country where you're just going to get more of this\nAnd anybody that the Democrats don't like is is going to be subject to guilt by accusation and this type of smearing slandering that goes on I'd also like to see a change in the standard in the law if you're a public figure well do you have to show in the ... the absence of malice how do you prove an absence of malice\nIt's a ridiculous standard that nobody could ever reach which is why people like you and me whatever what people say about us we get stopped taking it\nSure looked like learning to shake I think that overwhelmingly the American people do not want to reward that kind of behavior and I've seen you seen it now and the kind of surveys we're seeing now are amazing people have moved\nVery significantly in the last week and it shouldn't reaction to just pick up all oh and how vicious and how

I mean in other words I talk about every election Republicans raise the sexes massage Ines homophobic Xena phobic Islamophobia they weren't dirty air water and they want to kill granny I enrolled her over a cliff and they want to kill children well now with you know\nHold hangers being sent in and they're it's it's just the same tactics is dishonest\nTactics I think are backfiring on the Democrats and all of the activists and protesters and and these special interest groups the polling data Sean\nIs very revealing there was some apathy among Republicans as is often the case in the mid term election and suddenly that Shane ... and transformed GOP voters into\nEnergized and motivated voters to get out on\nElection day in next month because she what is going to happen if they lose the house and the Senate because Nancy Pelosi and sharing that with then become\nA chairman of the Judiciary Committee if Democrats win the house are vowing to a ... exact we're van ... a retribution\nInvestigation to remove calving off those from the Supreme Court by virtue of articles of impeachment and and there is nothing that will motivate of Republican voters more than that\nKind of what to undermine the Democratic process of confirmation and to try to stabilize the Supreme Court for partisan reasons\nIt's gonna be interesting to watch do you think politically John you watch a lot of campaigns is they're going to be as big as the American people going to be motivated in twenty nine days and they're going to remember this\nWell I Can't read the tea leaves but what we just saw with the confirmation battle actually was a an example of our separation of powers inaction were each branch exercise it's appropriate role and now in our democracy the people are going to decide\nAnd you know there are going to be irresponsible lawyers who are going to come\nGo on T. V. shows with more people who are claiming I should have been interviewed\nCould have told this town and I just hope that people can separate the wheat from the chaff\nHas a prosecutor looking at these three cases how would you handle them thirty six years later in each case no corroboration in each case\nUh well uh with I don't know anything beyond what's in the public record but without corroboration you might entertain a meeting for an hour or two and say thank you for coming by a desire to talk about\nUm okay so when when professor board for example she can't remember a location\nYou cant remember an exact date or a place not he's struggling to know the year in the case of ms ... she's calling other fellow students from back in the day she's asking them if they remember because she's not sure she remembers\nA in the case of Julie sweating like who who made the you know changed her story well Brett Kavanaugh gave out red solo cups and he was near the punch bowl and I saw him mental hauled maybe not lined up in a hall\nUm which is very different from the these sworn affidavit that they had originally laid out a week before I mean you ... if you look at that but in the prosecutor's office what are they going to say\nWell are they going to say a these are all frivolous accusations but uh as far as we know regarding Dr Ford there\nWere nine or ten witnesses interviewed and people are going to say well there were so many more who didn't weren't interviewed it's not the number of interviews\nIt's the what they have to say and if it's all cumulative you don't if you don't count the witnesses and but I think some of those other people as I say now I'm going to want to have their twenty four hours in the sun or you know in the in the same and they're going to want to go to the national Enquirer or something like that\nBut there are no criminal there no criminal cases are no civil cases a good man was confirmed he's now a justice and we need to move on\nLet's talk about the news that we are pretty confident as coming out this week um let me just say this very up to sleep I can that if a top ranking FBI official word a confirmed that\nThere was an orchestrated effort among the upper echelon within the the OJ and the FBI to\nGo after Donald Trump or retribution for the firing of James told me what would that mean Greg Garrett\nIt would mean that this was all a hoax the Russian hoax and it wasn't Trump Russia collusion\nAnd that would mean Greg Garrett was right from the get go but yeah I\nAnd and yes and the latest information only corroborate the thesis of the book there there wasn't Trump Russia collusion but there was Hillary Clinton\nBe more important I'm a volunteer tutor and mentor why because over

services to the platform are available to the states\nAnd in that application e specifically walk once pages ten through twelve and Seventeen the thirty four they're also looking for the D O D J what are known as thrilled to lose\nAnd those are the conversations between Bruce Oren Christopher Steele and we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann and Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker himself anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some doctors we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from but some key key documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of\nA ... with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel a and are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true\nAh I think that can be a lot of life can be shutdown that gift the documents we'd been requesting for quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday this week\nWe're going to issue a subpoena or to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page a tax uh\nThe uh the the Bruce or three oh one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that's in the middle of all of this\nAnd I said do you know what the news is tomorrow you getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere ... there we have people that know that were there that don't understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan in the scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president\nI'm hearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely shocked yup yup bitten by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other into\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trusted you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on\nIn terms of our various assessments you know similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted ... to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy\nTo share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah that's what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hospital\nRegime at and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact the food and does have a network of\nOf their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talked about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead at the\nDNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire our own people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington\nWho we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter dies I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd this is a first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting the phone call so I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ... ...\nThat they had this buys a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't\nWith I think first ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there is a buys a warrant on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at the time\n... it's funny Sean writes a interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox and what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they\nAgain because it's all about you know media perception what are they asking\nYou at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged right\n... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and again the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right by the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot\nAbout that did they ask you specifics about that dossier\nAbsolutely yeah and basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of revolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source for the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there is a an indictment\nOf ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back I Know media organizations have pulled lies about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you gonna do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some records for you\nWell I've definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that it's created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that\nYou should write a book what it's like to be spied on by your government you know some things a lot of serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but\nI mean what does it feel like ... I guess maybe there were some people because they took out the Warren on you\nDo you have you ... you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time basically yeah and you know going back many years again\nAnd we had talked about how many hours total do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours do you think you spent total over the last two years out of the last two decades two years last two years well I mean\nIn terms of actual in person meetings you know forty eight hours or something like that but you know when you add in the hundreds and hundreds of hours I had to do in terms of document production etcetera right now that's a whole different level\nWhen you went before a mall or what was that like\nYou know I don't I don't like to talk about that ... just because in general they have been a less leaky\nIn terms of getting the you know mentioning that fact but it was reported in December of twenty Seventeen December last year that I had a recently been in front of the grand jury and I won't I don't remember that\nNight but I I ... back at all absolutely not and you haven't you know and as the is it are they now stopped asking you questions one of the last time he got a call from anybody\n[noise] I haven't I haven't talked to anyone in twenty Eighteen\nIt takes twelve years to create a graduate but it takes the same time create a drop them\nAnd the difference between the chow becoming one or the other could be me more could be you know study showed [noise]\nI'm rich Dennison hurricane Michael expected to make landfall Wednesday in the Florida Panhandle bringing wins in excess of one hundred miles an hour torrential rain and deadly storm surge\nThat storm surge could be a foot high end even be felt in Tampa Bay states of emergency are in effect for twenty six Florida county\nFosters Evan brown investigators are trying to determine the cause of Saturday's limo crash in upstate New York that left ... dead officials say the limo failed and inspection last month\nThe driver to limo did not have the appropriate license to operate that vehicle\nNew York state police major Robert ... says they've recovered the limit was airbags center which will help determine the vehicle speed and other information Google Plus was shutting down Google parent company alphabet announcing the end of the social media platform after discovering a flaw which could have exposed the personal information of up to a half million\nUsers this Fox News [noise]\nDemocrats go to the fruits of hysteria over Supreme Court justices because they need this or else what happens to their project of\nPulling the entire country away from God and further and further to the left into a destructive of fish they can't get enough of us to vote with them so they get this mandated file legislators in black robes\nOn the Supreme Court violating what is constitutionally meant to be and replacing it with what they would like to walk Sexton\nLight on the patriots am eleven fifty\n\nNow traffic on the patriots am eleven fifty [noise]\nOn the freeway north bound just before Firestone boulevard is still far a little bit earlier looks like she used to be unseen hunting for tow trucks use extra caution there's some more the Firestone [noise] also on the one thirty for free way east bound at figure roller streets the stall reported on the ...\nCentury way west bound and Garfield avenue a break down there and some of us are reportedly still broken down\nIn the left lane and one of five freeway you spend a prairie avenue to car ... crashed right side of the freeway and that's one of five east of prairie also won a teen freeway you spent right around ... to boulevard a reportage do use caution there this report is sponsored by mothers marketing kitchen\nMothers marketing kitchen believes every person's journey towards health and wellness is unique mothers has the freshest organic produce and be able prices right now get juicy Bartlett pairs because Ninety nine cents a pound eight Southern California locations including the newly store in signal hill\nRichard ... and you're listening to a um\nFifty the patriots\nFirefighter I feel for yet from firehouse subs introducing the new firehouse pub stakes a savory steak crispy fried onions you know rich Belgian beers cheese sauce on top for limited time more to yours the firehouse subs dot com remember portion of every some you buy helps with my life saving women's first response\nAwesome joy more substance save more lives somebody's I'm only ...\nYou're listening to the Patriot am eleven fifty this wakes you up I Hope this motivate you I Hope you know the stakes are high I Hope you know there's a lot in play here\nNow we know Harry yet another institution I'm Broken and that kind of ... the ... the ...

J. last Thursday indicted a seven Russian hackers for hacking\nOr any doping agencies and Westinghouse here in the United states as well as a bunch of places in Europe and I was wondering if you had any take on that because three of those guys were named Mueller's indictment so I'm Wondering how it is they could have been doing I don't\nThink there's any that there is no doubt\nAt all that the ...\nAnd then the hospital regime of Russia be him being a hostile act or that he is that they are constantly trying to\nYou know create chaos in the United states and the constantly cite cyberwarfare now has been going on for many many years but I'm going to tell you something that very few people will tell you and that is at some point we've got to take responsibility for the fact that this is happening not only by the Russians by the Chinese and North Korea and the Iranians even\nSome of our so called allies are hacking into stuff\nYou know much intellectual property is stolen it's billions and billions of dollars from America's same ... you know if you look at Julian Assange whose name is probably I guess the most known oh Julian Assange is wanted his mid forties somewhere in there okay but he was sixteen years old and the guy hacked into\nNASA and the D O D that's how long this has been going on\nNow the the fact allegedly by the way\nThe fact that we have not created cyber defenses to prevent all hackers and we have and hire the best people to design the best systems to protect our intellectual property\nYou know at some point we can't blame others at some point we gotta look inward and say ah maybe we're the ones responsible that's what I'm thinking what do you think\n... I I think you're right about that one one question that I come up with with with this ah\nThe OJ indictment is they were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come it is to follow her can't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do\nYou know the the the OJ has very detailed information um I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look at over it's pretty it's pretty\nIn depth it's damning and you're right you know understand another thing is that not one of these people the mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial I don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact\nIt was Devon newness warned everybody what happened in twenty sixteen\nNow every other studies have shown that it has an impact the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have this vulnerability", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "08"}
