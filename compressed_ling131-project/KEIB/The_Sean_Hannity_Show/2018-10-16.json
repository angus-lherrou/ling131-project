the halls of Congress right which are that's where the people's business is supposedly down but we're talking people's lawns et cetera um you know look I support\nKind of free speech absolutist I

think it's very hard to tie I I ... I wasn't there I only watched what when\nThe fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line\nAnd um\nI got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the

citizens so that the men and women are no longer is\nGet to walk the halls without what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations zone\nAnd other than protest on the left and in the right in Congress including disrupting earrings and find a way all within the last week of ... and to\nDo it but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not

question\nI didn't take that as it's the same intensity and messages I'm hearing regularly but this is an everyday thing that is now happening with the Democratic party and by the way I have the evidence of me saying about Obama only\nPlay with ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou got to protect the president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile I\nMissed

the center for American Progress\nA switch is John Podesta old group he created this thing and another think tank I've never heard of the third way their advice thing Democrats what they should do and not do and the lead up to the election what they should say what they should not say spend as little time as possible talking about immigration\nDon't tell the people the truth about immigration sanctuary attacks a pack up punch it says that the memorandum\nOh okay New York times got a copy of this thing Democrats the strategy is preparing the memo or advising all Democrats that they could neutralize the attacks if they responded but they should spend as little time as possible talking about immigration itself instead\nPivot to more fruitful issues like by the way health care in taxation\nFor healthcare means he bomb a care I don't know how that's fruitful for them ... you know keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less that hasn't worked out very well people millions lost their doctors their plans and they're paying two three four times what they were ones paying and the only thing they want on taxation is oh they they they want\nYou know they use the rhetoric\nYou know redistribution tax cuts for the rich the reality is ah that's never been true in half the country only pays three percent of the tax bill\nThe latest numbers came I was in Bloomberg yesterday\nTop three percent of Americans pay the majority of taxes in this country the top three percent\nTop one percent pay forty percent\nThe top fifty percent of all taxpayers pay Ninety seven percent of the total individual income taxes let me say it another way the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers only pay three percent of the tax bill that's it\nYou know which small percentile of taxpayers you know also paid three percent or more well you know if you look at the top fourteen hundred taxpayers one thousand four hundred people in a country of three hundred plus million people\nThat group alone pays a massive share of fourteen hundred people pay nearly ... percent of the taxes just just fourteen hundred people\nTwo thousand one bottom fifty percent paid nearly five percent now it's down to three percent that's it you have this progressive tax system that they want but it's still not enough they want their crumbs back\nThey're not going to tell you Maxine Waters see Jason we can find the cut Maxine Waters said they don't they keep telling me not to say they don't\nWant me to try to have when you're dealing with what we have in Washington DC in the highest

and I'm not going to move her house you know there's a difference how some of our leadership talk about how we handle all of this not saying please don't say impeachment anymore [laughter] what they\nSay impeach him [noise]\nAnd they didn't they say Maxine don't say it\nIn other words yeah we we agree but we're not telling people what we want to do we're not going to we're not going to ... we just want to keep it quiet well we're going to do well that's what the center for American Progress is recommending they doing immigration\nIt's very difficult to wait on immigration with vulnerable vulnerable votes in states that Trump carried in twenty sixteen the strategy memo goes on arguing\nEven the most draconian a Republican policies like family separation threats to deport dreamers undocumented immigrants cetera et cetera\nFailed to sway most voters emphasis added let me interpret this for you\nMaxine being quiet don't tell the people the truth of what we're really going to do\nDon't talk about immigration don't tell them we want to eliminate I stop saying it don't tell them you won't open borders keep lying to them you know we've got Claire McCaskill we got an unbelievable tape that we're gonna play at the top of the next hour would project Vera tops remember last week we had\nYou know former governor of Tennessee ... and the people in his office\nBasically saying we're only saying publicly were voting for Kavanaugh thought he'd never do it\nWe just need to get these Republican voters we need to bamboozled them we need to manipulate them we need the propagandize them and lie to them tell them whatever they want to hear but when he gets in office he's going to do the right thing\nAnd the tape that we ... we revealed last night on Hannity well more of this tonight and dying it's better if you see we're going to play the next hour but McCaskill on tape of course she's going to vote for gun bans in our campaign staff yes course she wants to semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on gun views because he has a bunch of Republican voters\nBut if this tape revealed she secretly supports gun control groups\nHer staff says you can we gotta wait until after election to bring up Trump impeachment you know to voters ... listen if they don't understand why we won't say they need to get over it you know people just can't know\nThat ... McCaskill end up ... Obama they have the same view on everything it's all in this tape people just can't know that they actually are heard or campaign guy saying and McCaskill's office\nWell they do all this is why campaigns you cannot anybody in this program you can't list what they stand for\nNobody in the media ever told you what eight years of Obama did to this country maybe that's why I sound like a broken record Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps after eight years you kidding me you want to go back to that\nEight million more in poverty the worst recovery since the forties lowest participation rate since the seventies lowest homeownership rate in fifty one years\nYou know we had the only president ever in history not to reach three percent GDP Growth than a year we just had four point to present the last quarter under Trump\nThe only president that you know said nine trillion in debt the irresponsible and unpatriotic well he accumulated more debt than all forty three presidents before him combine\nAll of this is on the ballot and\nI haven't even mentioned the fact that President degraded defeated eighty percent of ISIS that the president stopped little rocket man from firing rockets every other day over Japan and threatening the entire region with with a nuclear war\nOr forget the fact that he's he kept his promise on trade deals on pipelines on deregulation and war is open the coal industry has been said he spent three and a half billion dollars on the wall he promised is fighting for the other twenty five million\nAnd they gave us the biggest tax cut in American history and to originalist justices no other president ran on the idea that\nHe'd keep originalist on the Supreme Court and he got done let me just say more simply\nIf you don't get your ass out to vote\nThen gets half a vote for polo see in the house and half a boat for ... if you got to senator up in your state if you vote for a Democrat you might as well just vote for below sea 'cause that's what you're getting\nThe earthquake authority I'm elderly and you are listening to the Patriot am eleven fifty you're listening to the Patriot am eleven fifty\nRadio show mainstream media day this is Sean Hannity show\n[laughter]\n\nI think there's no question that we got to critically reexamine and its role as a way that it is saying and what we need that sorry that\nI think we need to abolish ice that things really clear in terms\nOf the phone is set in corporate America of a siege versus the crumbs as I say are kidding she workers to ... put to schmooze on it's so pathetic\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill today [noise]\nAnd [noise] we get up in the face of from Congress people\nEliminating for instance and President Trump [noise]\nThey have strayed so far from the interest of the American people and the interests of humanity or we need to we need to abolish it\nWhen the American people learn that some of them are not getting anything some of them getting raises and the rest are getting from and big corporations and wealthy individuals are getting nice fat pieces of pie they're going to be outraged they are already [laughter]\nIce isn't doing what it was created to do it's being used as his own personal a police force and in those actions it's actually making us less safe\nWhen this country understand and sales what has been done with a tax scam or what that's going to do for our deficit in this country it's gotta be reverse\nAnd I think he should we imagine and during the agency with a very different mission and take the commission's out and so\nWe believe that\nWe should protect families that need our help and that is not what I think today and that's why I Believe you should get rid of what\nWe have proposed as an increase in the corporate tax rate\nYour body cabinet [laughter]\n\nWe need to read the immigration system from above starting something that we're\nMore [noise]\nMedicare for all it's actually much more is actually much chip ice on the current system that will pay right now\nI'm not saying please don't say impeachment any more about what they\nSay impeach if [noise]\nIf it turns out that he does become justice Kavanaugh and your chairman of the house Judiciary Committee would you investigated for possible impeachment if he is on the Supreme Court and the Senate has investigated than anything else will have to do investigate we would have to investigate\nI twenty four till the top of the hour oh that is the agenda nonstop investigation impeachment uh don't tell anybody max ... thought they keep saying don't say it but I'm going to say it don't talk about immigration\nWon't even mention you want the crumbs back don't mention you want to eliminate ice but we have all the tape\nJust like Britain us and British and yet you know the project Vera toss cameras are inside there and they're like oh trust us She's not voting for Kavanaugh he's just saying that the get rural voters he only wants to be there one term in when he's there he's just going to do what's right he'd never vote that way\nI I don't think the people of Tennessee appreciate the fact that Brett as soon as a total fake phoney and all fraud was Claire McCaskill is as well as we expose last night with project ... another part we have that will air tonight on TV\nJames O'Keefe is going to join us I mean it's I mean when they're literally saying um oh listen listen because people can't know but of course Claire and Obama they have the same views on everything\nWhat a gender the proposing that you like what what what are they offering you the Democratic party that you find the practice because we have news out today that we can add to the\nFour hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs that weren't coming back to four plus million new jobs that have been created in less than two years the eight million out of food stamps and poverty the best recovery we've seen that's GDP Growth in such a long

admitting that she's being told do talk about impeachment just shut shut up about it we we know we know we're going to do but we're not going to\nWe're not going to help people the truth before an election that's Claire McCaskill and and people on her staff people just can't know that she wants a semi automatic rifle ban and that\nThat of course she would vote yes on gun bans of course she supports the semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on guns because she has a bunch of Republican voters but secretly shoes so she supports say hey gun control group\nYou know in our staffers saying well wait till after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now\nWith you know three weeks Twenty one days collection they why would

C. A. as people with preexisting conditions have been paying more yeah higher premiums and they were paying before\nMany lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate with tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that\nTaxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution scheme\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors\nAnd we've talked about health savings accounts and we also talked about atlas MD Dr Josh amber and Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all\nIf you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nThey negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction in the high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine and a greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store\nAnd where are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do they are the innovators in this upfront pricing lower cost no government mentally All right well that's true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know\nFor example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would then would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nNow health care's local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors\nAnd one thing that's clear as the cavalry is not coming from Washington to save us now if we wait for solutions from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other six cause problems themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is it eliminates\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our patients\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so\nEvery American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great the great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh number Dr ... gross is probably one of the defining issues that caused people make people think the

health care for everybody in the world it's a sign you're basically our governor saying\nLegal doesn't matter resident non resident doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care\nNow if the average California is that is taxed at Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if you're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction whether\nPeople want to experiment with is that you know what am I I'm not there to tell people\nYeah no I agree with you know they have on him because I'm thinking that it get out of California can't afford to stay taxes and the parents have to\nI mean it's unbelievable look and why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey and Illinois just\nStates like Florida Texas in the Carolinas wire Californians all going in Texas you know what what did Democrats on what they're hoping for that California demographic shift so that the people that ruin California and left might do the same thing to Texas so unbelievable which is what the beta O'Rourke has been all about from the beginning\nAnyway you know good luck um I Would say John Cox will be a

with the tape that they release the Claire McCaskill is devastating that she's hiding what she's running on that same happened a governor governor reticent and Tennessee\nHave Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble\nAre we now see Heller was very important seed in Nevada he's now up by seven in the latest poll only state I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and and the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response and that's to hurricanes I remember that benefit there in the last year where we are Scott has really shown if you're a member of showing the two thousand twelve election right here in Jersey or that for Hurricane Sandy hit and then President Obama had the advantage of\nActing like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney is basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to a ... member around me at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager\nA for Mr Obama at that time and he said yesterday I said why did Senator Warren have to do her announcement with our DNA now he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think there's Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the the headlines\nAround that she's Ninety six percent European I mean at at that one one thousand twenty fourth she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type I mean but it is it to her she literally personally change herself\nWho minority status when you pan and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out they're outraged by\nRight and that was a turning point right when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation finding that that the headlines yesterday Associated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American\nHeritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA test with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relieve reveals proof of Native American ancestry again\nWhat proof at this so backfired on her ... particularly when Cherokee Nation a nation got involved and and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow or I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies in twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty four just written and that's it 'cause now this defines her and this is not something you're shaker easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where\nYou can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah I Know that you turned to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left one of the party is taking over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and I was a group formed by none other than John Podesta but they're running their reelection now very revealing the Maxine Waters says\nThey keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five so they're hiding their agenda we learn that in this project\nOr a ... tape with Claire McCaskill in our own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks pack up punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were obtained a copy of it and Democrats and strategies to prepare the memos said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot to more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their ... to ... Democrats too when they have\nTo pretty much lie misrepresent con be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed and and the types of agenda items they really have that's not an enviable position to be I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP about four percent unemployment below four percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings\nThat ... that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states\nThese are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments\nTrump is winning right now you want with capital as well even the CNN did a segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member\nOf al ... who was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into the selection because to your point they have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think that I Can't\nRemember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive hey that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right who was it will make America great again or keep America great again\nThe Trump can run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have\nA if it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump's in trouble like you did in two thousand sixteen but again a till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that she jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate that can have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had\nOf these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nNot sure if the poll is accurate but it has him down and that surprises me but I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nI always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day and Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at these other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her or if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate\nYeah and and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona have red state Texas Red state Tennessee read stand\nBy the way up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with him this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember better O'Rourke out more money than any count my gosh are eight million dollars I mean he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know I I think we'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans and Eighteen but\nYeah that would've been a very big symbolic victory of ... somehow could've unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so\nThe Senate you got to think they're probably going to pick up three or four seats and now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how Democrats don't win twenty three seats went back out and given the history Eighteen or the last twenty mid term I have got against the party in power by an average of something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know what I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up at fifty fifty that Republicans keep asking if that happens after all this negative press that President Trump has received Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I I Will tell you I think the fact that you're you've hit two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the cabin on hearings and we've seen a post Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores in gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not wanted here anymore anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because I say in it\nFor a media perspective it's funny because then you have even some anchors on CNN that are saying you know the people that chased Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant right they're not a mob and you can't say the word\nMop not allowed to say the words mob All right stay right there will continue Joe ... he is the media reporter on the hill a will come back also the stormy storming networks are a little bit quiet except for the president's tweet we'll get into that when we get back eight hundred nine four one showing your calls in the final half hour\nYou know I I don't try to figure out who's having a worst month um the New York giants\nElizabeth Warren or Michael ... I'm Sorry I have an audio complete those those two names uh yeah I mean that that's that's pretty big that that was thrown out Sean because I mean that's the killer that now stormy has actually responsible for Trump's legal fees I ... and by the way every court case should\nBe always gotten ... from the beginning I'm kind of it these are street fighter um but I think what especially during the capital hearings with Julie sweating egg I mean it was was pretty outrageous 'cause she was claiming almost on a weekend basis\nYou know that Brett Kavanaugh was that these parties and they were drug in these young girls and these boys were lining up in the hall and and gang raping these girls as a matter of adults almost a weekly thing\nDidn't have it on his ... I Would think a fairly smart guy right\nAnd and to listen to that story and say I'm going to go to that with this I'm going to say that a girl who was two three years removed from high school repeatedly he went back\nTo parties were gang rapes were going on she knew they were going on and she still kept going back and oh I won't be able to actually find anybody that can corroborate the stories at least no one can independently find anybody\nThat was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find the people that Julie sweating except we're at those parties one's dead\nOr to wouldn't returned our calls at one didn't know who actually sweating it was so now Democrats who used to hell ... and the media obviously\nAnother story and but also hurting on it but in the process they gave up any semblance of core values that everyone believes it and that's due process in the presumption of innocence that's where they lost that\nI got to run but Joe ... over the hill dot com you want to check out his work is probably the only meeting he is the only media reporter in the country that I Know that is actually fair and balanced and\nAnd he goes against the grain and thank you for a great job thanks so much quick break right back your calls on the other side of big candidates and I tell you about that in a minute including pastor Brunson is going to speak out his first cable interview tonight at nine what it was like in prison in Turkey and much more [noise]\n\nSenator Feinstein was literally\nWe all know because they knew they had nothing\nAll they had was just me

to doctors um and of course Obamacare because it seems to be the only one issue now that Democrats want to run on and boy it's such a bad portrayal inaccurate portrayal of what they have\nRushed upon the country in the differences dramatic it's different in any way we put it up on Hannity dot com you can read it for yourself\nOr as we have a lot of articles up there that you can read or write as

welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nThank you sir good talking to you talk anyway alone on out there like I Know you've been in my living room so many times in the road around with me in the car [laughter] well\nThey want to know the truth you really do know me you know I've always said is you really can't fake it put three our four hours a day\nI mean yeah he me on TV you hear me on the radio I mean I Can't just we don't write lines for this program we just talk and you know unless I guess your super con artist I don't think it's you're capable people can ascertain who you really are especially that's why they call ... ...\nYour warmth media\nThat you're exactly right you're exactly right\nLooks out and the reason that caught was that was this known your program yet they fight a clip from Hillary Clinton's speech and in in that she mentioned the fact that the only way we're going to return to civility in this country is to elect Democrats and then when I heard it dawned on me that's extortion she's telling us telling the American people\n[noise] the only way you don't have any peace impressed shut up shut up is still Democrats\nThat's pretty you know that's one way to put it but you gotta understand\nThe day Donald Trump won the left in this country those quote resistance in this country now\nThat now emerging into a mob in some cities in this country and confronting you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then then of course you know putting their anarchist symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera\nAll of this remember Maxine Waters set it if you see them get a crowd get a crowd\nAnd you confront them and you follow them into department stores in gas stations and and restaurants and you tell\nThem you know wanted anywhere anymore okay well\nThat sounds like you want something bad to happen and the fact that the Democrats are now the strategy is to hide who they are don't\nBe honest lie we see it in the project baritone videos\nOr ... it is either they're not telling Maxine Waters that said they keep telling me not to say it then you read the center for American Progress don't talk about immigration because if you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's it's sad that this is what it takes for them to win it had that Hillary Clinton had the cheat Bernie Sanders to get the nomination and that she tried to use the phony Russian tough the a\n... and then had all of our deep state friends lying to the American people with unverified uncorroborated Russian bought and paid for lives\nThis is who they are there's nothing that they're running on that tells me oh if you elect us we're going to create jobs by doing this\nWhat Trump said how we create jobs by giving us the largest tax cut and eliminating burdensome regulation and opening up bad ... building pipelines and saving the coal industry those are saving jobs\nSo you know the ... look it's I'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV set\nAnd you're gonna watch the coverage and you're either going to be you know maybe maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained ... seats in the Senate when\nMaybe they lose the house you lose the house then all you're gonna see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump paint and investigations and possible impeachment that's the agenda that's it\nThere's nothing to improve the lives of the American people ... you know there was a lot of states", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "16"}
