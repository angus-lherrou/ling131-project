I mean you just rejected out of hand but showing going forward there's something very special about the Supreme Court you know the fact that the confirmation was fifty to forty eight it's not like where I'm trying to be the point spread\nAdjust its now justice cabin on so long the judge Kavanaugh he was confirmed and the Supreme Court just must be above the fray and not send out political

I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd this was first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ... I first started getting the phone call so I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ...\nThat they had this buys a war against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report a I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of oil and the uh first Pfizer weren't with I think\nFirst ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there's a Pfizer Warren on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at the time\n... it's funny Sean right hey interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but there again because it's all about you know media perception\nWhat were they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged\nWith anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going\nTo be charged right absolutely well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right by the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about that that they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've\nBeen a source for the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there is a an indictment of ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lives about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some records for you\nWell I've definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that it's created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMight the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that you should write a book\nWhat it's like to be spied on by your government you know some things a lot of serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like ...

that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation he's kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt bill today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall we now record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years the last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises on feely dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea the sanctions in Iran are now paying off\nWe see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he would select from many selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd in twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts of working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a head of the investigation and the next hour\nYou know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice when she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck and company and told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration a Hillary in may\nOf twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing and then all of a sudden they interview heard Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nMan that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and they exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remembered than all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney\nRemember the company ... that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Donald Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait which is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group that they went out and hire the former and my six agent\nOr the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August ... Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI who is now gone twenty five top representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or\nOr stepped aside\nAnd anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's studying in terms of what it reveals since that directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI official sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath\nAnd Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was cut out he was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in fact you know its application then for the Pfizer warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dusty aid that even the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nThe fights application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction of Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton from the get go\nWhich by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials after the OJ and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party being behind all this Clinton dirt\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes us he was on with Maria berets aroma think on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice for doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the Pfizer warrant to snoop on Trump's campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the Pfizer warrant to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without a Hillary's involvement here\nThey wouldn't have been a ... an application to spy on the Trump campaign they wouldn't be fusion GPS or die ca on Trump we wouldn't be living through

weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told is the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I say I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not have Ninety eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf\nBut a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the of sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain but once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember Florence was\nOff its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast\nThis one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast and

person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much what is the angle of the storm matter\nAnd it's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming

classical faction from the southwest and\nIt's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately a

breaking developments as it relates to the biggest abuse of power a scandal in American history one has to do with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein member he recommended the firing of combing number two we was the one that that recommended the special counsel Robert Mueller\nThree is also the guy that signed the fourth financial advisor warrant in other words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associate\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to seek alert secretly recorded conversations with President Trump\nAnd the hope she'd say something that they could use and then and vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWhen he was pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS and research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... same dusty a that was never corroborated a verified but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd it gets worse than that it was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used when our understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers who've die by the name of Michael ... directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenty sixteen election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton at the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance now the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it why did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer warrant\nWiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI I've sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes staying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department were all during the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants\nAnd permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and Greg Jarrett continue with us anything I'm saying here that is wrong right Jarrett\nYou got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the D O D J knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who compose is a totally fabricated phony document\nBased on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed\nA launch this investigation Peter ... truck signed\nThe papers he had just finished meeting with Christopher Steele and in fact the same day that James Comey cleared Hillary Clinton twisting the long could towards the facts his FBI was meeting for the first time in Europe in a building with Christopher Steele\nWho had compose this phony ... that the FBI was never able to verify and yet they ran with the dial aiding investigation to damage Trump and then\nThey violated other federal regulations that say you may never use on verified information

here so they're all saying the same thing so creating enough smoke so that there would be right fire\n'em and all the FBI guys they all knew it wasn't true from the beginning at least a page even

exactly right\nThey they hadn't even begun to substantiate process and yet they're using it presenting it as a fancy to verify the court when you look at this\nPoint they willingly loud before ... ...

to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundational are supposed to serve on health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table when ever having been caught in a conversation about health care\nSo we put traditions or talking back with able to have those conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that with some ... here in southwest Florida ... the ... health are pushing me was why are we use them insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create obstacles to access some tour when we were ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWas ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about about health insurance we're just using the wrong and you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because the ... one of the insurance is using them shots drives up the cost of the other products\nSo am I cashed parks process two hundred and twenty\nWell using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so I'm pleased to see what the you know we're shifting the conversational from\nCoverage for everyone wants to talk about reducing the cost of health care that real close enough I was about ... upon us some help committee you know honestly because I pop it\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock\nGather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody whether your pay our taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick um\nBut there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that are up public in his within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nAdopt ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my\nDoctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack or accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars per year or a month a month so\nAnd the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or that the real ... and the the politician their heads and California is the ... on a ridge analogy\nJust throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nThe what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get much cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nI'm actually looking at ways it fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add up to that just a a book you know it was part of the cost of care is the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well mama care made that illegal\nAh so little stretching just brought offshore explode with access to these major medical plan it's called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue look these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses they're Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nEverybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over and not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly to negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nBoy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance we can\nLower the cost and in past the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those because they're going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nBut they're gonna have to move to New York because they don't make it easy but they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that\nWould be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take the New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills a blood pressure medicine I Can't I Want to buy a thousand pills I Can't and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than\nWhat about Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we've wage you down with regulatory burden\nSo we're going to cut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can\nWrite a quick break we'll come back more with Dr Josh amber outlets MD and Dr Lee s grows president docks for a patient care foundation\nThere's the ...\nWhat's the big banks once again write their own rules on Shane walls\nUp what y'all boxing is wrong one the leader of the Republican Party this Congress are doing and blocking an accurate because they don't want to jump everyone that they don't bring him down home\nOr in burn Berman imagine you Jim ... the basketball more secret three point John what they're not in favor on it do you really have the potential to be a leader in your community that might be able to get their own colorblind\nTo finally be leaving now because he was governor George W.
