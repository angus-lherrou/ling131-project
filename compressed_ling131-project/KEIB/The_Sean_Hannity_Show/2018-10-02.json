[noise]\nThis is a Fox News alerts an Indonesian quick update on jak Callahan Fox News authorities in Indonesia\nThe New Yorker piece this was by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that they interviewed several dozen people in an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person with first hand knowledge and then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting\nFormer your classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself\nNow that's what they're saying and remember she admitted she quickly became a ... she had gaps in her memory foggy slurring of words\nSo that's what the Democrats are said there's a credible allegation well if it was so credible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of the last week 'cause they they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to\nThen we've got the the third incident which is the ... case where a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been the Kennedys parties herself personally\nThat there was Brett Kavanaugh and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a a whole series of allegations he looked at it as Byron York said the gold polls\nHave moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people that but not just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh and they want to continue the smears the slander the lies ... character assassination frankly the polls\nPolitical blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein had this for six long weeks she had this back in July there was a California state or California congressman that had it early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein\nDianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh and then of course we had the original hearings\nAnd not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is the lawyer that represents professor poured but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's radical left political the attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week\nOf a friend of this attorney for professor Ford this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right a professor Ford or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they were soliciting women to accuse judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety and this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope\nThey were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape\nAnd one email sent a late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart an all girls school near Georgetown Prep\nWith the subject line corroboration needed never cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by Brett Kavanaugh on his yearbook page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F\nA wording in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit please contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for\nNow if it was truly limited in scope and we know that in the case of professor poured that they were four people she mentioned we're at this party\nSome don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was at the you know that when the perjury I mean ... under the penalty of a felony here\nSo they all signed these affidavits all agreed that ... that they didn't have any recollection and the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event\nThat eye witness has said under penalty of a felony that it never happened what professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put mark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident\nSo I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond\nSee whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements ... there's nothing else really left for them to do please use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody\nTo come forward please please come forward\nAnd then the hope is that there will be delayed again and again and again and\nYou know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week\nNow is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yet who knows what Dianne Feinstein knows then the only thing they've got is well didn't commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank you know could did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out now he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking bureau lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to a blackout was an I worked as a bartender for a number of years\nI Know a lot about alcohol I watched it up close and personal you\nKnow everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose\nFor some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and I have to throw him out and they'd be walking straight\nHaving been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individuals individual is just it's an enormous you know you see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all\nI learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter um anyway so we got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time many\nOf which I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today\nAnd he said that he was a poster was the Clintons pollster\nAnd he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he found is the support for professor Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning uh one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by Remington research group because the election is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader\nOf the United States Senate because that's what the Democrats want now if this doesn't\nIf this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of success the president has it it it diminishes any chance they have it getting back their power\nAnd after two years of trying to destroy the president you know they want a crescendo their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we've got this election

use his exact words from his op ed refusal to most people will speak to the refusal to do so is its own kind a statement\nOf the problem with that is if you don't remember something perfectly\nWith the FBI and you're talking to them it's a chronic it's a felony and if you don't believe me asked General Flynn and if you don't believe me as Papadopoulos who faced five years in jail\nYou know the idea that you know the FBI back in the middle of it you know you're screwed that's what you know when I was handed the Clinton email investigation the deputy director said to me you know you're totally screwed right\nWell maybe you shouldn't have been writing in may before you interviewed Clinton and before you interviewed any of the other Seventeen witnesses maybe maybe you shouldn't have

President you said that it can correct to say you're limiting the skill of the FBI investigation\nWhat does that has to do is I don't mind answering the question but you know I'd like to do the ... with the other headline and then there's which is kind of it and I know how that talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit later think anybody ever had a great deal of hats or Congress there are I think so but you know if it doesn't we have lots of other alternatives but I Do think so I think if they're fair\nWhich is a big question but if it's fair on both sides are Republicans love it\nIndustrial opposite our country loves it or if it's fair it will pass I think it'll pass easily\nRight our to Sean Hannity show as we're back in the swamp were back in D.C a lot of breaking news eight hundred nine four one showing has a toll free\nTelephone number you want to be a part of the program well what was supposed to be last week a limited in scope and done very quickly is now evolved into Democratic senators\nOh the FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against judge Brett Kavanaugh\nBy the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last week if they don't want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we've got an interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including\nThat anonymous person and this anonymous person that literally trying to tell the FBI had to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of this left wing attorney that's representing professor forward that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remembered Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professor Ford\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt this is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we got delayed like we wanted now we're going to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one Democrat decent enough or disgusted enough to end this cabinet travesty\nAnd he joins us now Sarah how are you welcome back to the program\nI'm doing well but I was very struck this morning by Byron ... column in which he points out that the Democrats having decided that sex may not work are now looking at whether or not\nKevin all might have been an accurate in describing how much he drank so they're spreading a wider\nAnd frankly at an age when Justice Ginsburg was very political and some attacks on President Trump\nDemocrats are trotting out judicial temperament of this whole thing is is this character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country and it is it tells us who they are I mean I think the key to the election this fall is which America do you want to be\nDo you really want to be an America where somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage and then get smeared on ending league was totally uncorroborated assaults as I said really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as could be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beer then sometimes I drink too much beer\nHe denied ever blacking out I mean the accusation that somebody could observe some well he had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remember the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that\nBut what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying uh we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is\nThis is nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge town\nThis is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassin H me or cheat I mean when you when you have\nWhen you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into a an elevator to harass or senator\nOver and over and over again which you have on the left his willingness to break the rules to get what they want and I think that is a very serious problem\nYou know it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years\nYou know when people talk and I watched a lot of there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nAnd I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused of literally drugging women and boys lined up halls all over the costs of course of many weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that\nDon't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me let me play historian from it because\nI spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through when you know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh deceiving example who you are getting you know wondering Blumenthal as the president was pointing out\nIs terrible record of overtly publicly lying about having served in Vietnam when he didn't know suddenly he's lecturing us on the importance of honesty and integrity [noise]\nAs I thought about it I went back and found a the following quote from Abraham Lincoln\nWhich he gave at Cooper Union in New York City and Eighteen sixty\nSpeaking about the defenders of slavery who are prepared to destroy the union\nHe says quote your per person than\nPlainly state it is that you will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please\nOn all points in dispute between you and us you will rule or ruined and all events close quote I the reason I brought that option is I really believe that's where we are\nI think on the left you have people at Maxine Waters remember if they get a majority she chairs the committee\nAnd she's not some random back bench not take she's a senior member of the Democratic party leadership and she has publicly saying that people you go out and find members of the Trump Administration you harass them in the stores you harass them at the gas station you harass them at the at a restaurant what kind of country is that\nWell they're telling everybody to do it now they're out on a fishing expedition in what they promise last week which would be limited in scope and you know at an extra day to expedite the timeframe is now you know they're expanding it out even ...\nYou stick short days I called the most important midterms

middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those types of shows and doing other things that people want to mock now but I'm\nIn any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation a number one first will work conservatives we have a moral compass if we if we do detect but there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one is that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans do investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use the power to investigate everything that's going on here\nAnd potentially witness was being coached

I'd I'd sure they were it was easy to find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee like the the the goalposts are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to believe that any of these people and it it could take themselves seriously they said\nIt's going to be here for days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she worked at that every Democrat that that now they're going up the Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI are actually going to be it's horrible part is an organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's\nLifelong reputation here on the line\nTakes your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well and this case\nI I don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on there is someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to get simply use that as their case is counted the name of discounts and because they disagree with in any way\nOn a clear someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective\nOn that that judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit at a lower court catch\nThe Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times they found out they vindicate his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him\nI don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk a part in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of the people that\nHave but I like it\nIf the parents have been brought a reputation now\nYou read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's pack it in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was on a ration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange\nUm and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day uh I don't think that's the ... in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your behalf\nVery different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions of course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions\nMost people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer\nEver and I'm like why am somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but\nThe FBI is is the FBI people I Know the whole to the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that this ... hit companies coming and low right now is just to try to destroy the Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the irony at the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to live the FBI is the one that said it's a crime to like the Senate and they're with their debts get it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not\nThey've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of what the FBI guys to say that that it's somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the St Louis to people the Senate Judiciary committee had already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same state 'cause the FBI can't and ... how much they can't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of the old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new here that they're they're my prediction\nIRA and that they don't have any other thing they've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they had attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate a story and then saying that Mrs Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking the other if she telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think with the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer telling people she's not even sure it with him she says like pop that he was in the room [laughter]\nI'm positive he adjusted his hands but if that means that so but I but I Can't say for start to get hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her\nI I I mean ... even counting the cut about ... you know what go for the FBI could talk to her and they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to hold on wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the

ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that that we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where it is the news hindered in any capacity

and\nAh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad but it was given in part a a due to the news networks um thing about Michael I have an ... her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people are ... there was nothing to this story\nUm and when she offered a witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm since the story is already out there and has already done it damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted them no floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in her case um was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nAll the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling

is that fell bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace\nA Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlet fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a a three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... or any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do\nA there your colleagues maybe you have some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but right close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but it'd be a fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then from but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delayed legitimize\nThe way he was treated if the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man's been abused are not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states uh were Democrats or rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yes\nMost Democrats wouldn't know no matter who Donald Trump test ride they've already against score six yeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell a smart question Martha makes Sally is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... Ford's claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly ... camp to vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state from state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now\nI'm so you mean you're you're communicating hand I don't I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in\nThis is about the teacher the judiciary the states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook\nThat if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can find yeah find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of these states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nOh it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\n[laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a Baptist I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've\nSpain and Washington and that's saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short or less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm a pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves\nThink ... [noise] yes\nNo I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot off but\nThey have on them is that this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those audience on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or conservative and you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage or just a homophobic Xena pope Islamophobia you're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children and it's got to be all look alike of youth throwing a grandma over a cliff\nIs as predictable as the day is long and now which Supreme Court nominees\nThis slander has been taken to a whole new level do you have a nice throwing incident when you were nine I mean it's ridiculous\nPolitics of just corruption\nBut we have seen and we've had to sit here and just take it when we think it can get lower it does is there any shame\nGlenn Beck program morning is on the loan\nRadio I'm rich Dennison Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer rejecting claims by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell that his party's movie would goalpost when it comes to delays in the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh coming\nFrom the same man who delayed the nomination of Supreme Court justice Merrick Garland for over three hundred days without a shrugged his shoulders give me a break a\nConfirmation vote on Kavanaugh is expected to take place after an FBI investigation into sexual misconduct allegations Kevin I'll denies those accusations President Trump telling his tentative trade deal with Mexico and Canada while in Philadelphia today NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made\nIn any country at any time\nThe Dow today hitting a record high for the fourteenth times this year Fox News\nWe report due to side [noise]\n[noise]\nNow traffic on the Patriot am eleven fifty\nAnd send him a century what you spend it via Verde as sold big rig was blocking to re leans for a long time it's been clear for a little bit but there's still some extra slow going as you make you mean in that area ten east bound so look for the gym to continue for a little bit even the links have been hoping for a bit of time\nMid city freeway west bend your Crenshaw Boulevard\nAn accident there the right wing blocked in traffic is slow and go to about Norman ... mission Hill's breakdown stolen car when he teen freeway you spend it to four or five and the top of the transition where they are tending to it right and started the connector winning team east at the ... freeway\nThis report sponsored by California banking trust always in your corner you never know what's around the next corner that's why you need a bank is always in yours\nCalifornia bank can trust offers a wide selection of loans lines of credit and the guidance to choose his account bank trust dot com and Richard turn a journey of eleven fifty the patriots\nGroup and you know the American market journalist when they for to subject credit for some ...\nGet a lower payment on a larger alone now have you been told no on a jumbo purchased a refinance the shell towns says yes hate your friend Sean Hannity here that maybe you got one of those quote interest only loans that's about the double\nOr maybe you simply need some cash out well after almost three decades processing loans Michelle knows how to go outside the box and find a program that work specifically for you\nSean leaders helped one of your listeners in that exact situation they were in a seven year interest only loans that was about to reset we were able to secure than they fully advertise Fortier alone that will also say them five hundred dollars per month\nAlmost show with a town group before interest rates go up just say Sean Hannity told you to speak directly to the girl who gets it done all eight three three my jumbo loan or go to why Michele town dot com that's ma show with one L.
