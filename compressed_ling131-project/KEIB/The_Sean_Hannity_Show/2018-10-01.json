Am with you every single Sunday right here answering your questions and talking about things that truly matter in life and the afterlife\nI'd love to hear from you you have a theology question or life situation dilate seven seven holy host numerically that's eight seven seven for six five nine for six seven check at our website the Jesus Christ showed dot com\nFor information about our archives page check all that out of Jesus Christ you're dot com and follow us on Twitter at Jesus' show\nToni welcome to the Jesus Christ show yeah my question is about ...\nSchool once once you're safe your state and the other one said that you can lose your salvation and also had a question about water\nOK well yes there there is a two schools of thought and they go back and forth um as to you know whether you can lose your salvation or not ... uh my thought to them or those that we believe that you could lose your salvation would be first will how do you being salvation\nIf it's a gift it's nothing you can earn as says scripture then how could you on earning and\nTo what is that thing that you can do that is worse that is so bad that not even my blood the blood of Christ on the cross could cover it\nYou think that's a fair question yeah\nUm and I and I don't I'm not sure that there is a good answer on that side says well it's almost saying that man is more powerful than God\nOr when it comes to that now there are those that would go to the book he bruised and they'd say okay well um but what about chapter six for sports says um and I'll read it to you quickly it says when the case of those who have one spin enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made her take her to the Holy Spirit\nFirst five and have tasted\nThe good word of God and the powers at the age to come and then have fallen away it is impossible to renewed them again to repent and since they again crucified themselves the son of God and put him to open shame\nThe interesting thing there is that the word tasted is the same word or in a Matthew twenty seven thirty four I talked about me on the cross that said that I tasted but did not drink\nSo the illustration in Hebrew chapter six years really of somebody who\nWho sort of case of salvation you know and maybe they go to church a little bit or maybe they say oh yeah I'm a Christian but really not\nThey they never fully took it in and in that case they may appear to be a Christian and fall away but they weren't they never were they they never really truly a embraced it or played it to their life\nAnd therefore it was more appearances are kind of a facade a synthetic kind of outside thing and then they've fallen away but if it is truly\nWhat you believe\nA and it's truly a an invitation that you that that you received a God knocks on on your heart and he used to I come on and then how are you going to on gift that\nIn some way what are you going to possibly do that out does the blood and across um doesn't make a whole lot of sense so quickly your your other question\nYes my other question was what about this in this water baptism essential for salvation\nKnow again it would put it in the in the context of you adding something to the blood on the cross so now now it's yeah it becomes a work now doesn't mean that a baptism a is an incredibly important and there isn't spirit a spiritual happenings taking place when you\nUh get baptized but it is really about understanding\nI'm In my death and resurrection and in a through this symbol but an act of your rebirth as well that is important if you get into well it's a ... it's a necessity then there's problems with Paul in fact the policy that hey I'm Glad you know I didn't baptize any of you and\nAnd all these different things that you've got problems in scripture um\nThat you know people start wrestling with but really the biggest thing because there will be those that argue well what about the the fund across\nIf you remember I said today you will be with me and paradise it's not like they pulled him off the crossing and baptized him and put it back on 'em there's those that say yeah but ... died yet so therefore it wasn't under that and all these different things to get around it the truth being more importantly than all of that is\nWell why would you have to add something to what I did on the cross\nOther than receiving ... other than the very active receiving\nYou know it's almost like um [noise]\nThis analogy may hit with some of you may not with others uh there's a there's a belief um my producer Neal is very much into a to cooking and baking all this there is a belief that if you\nReceive a steak from from a chef that you're not supposed to season it until after you eat it\nIt's disrespectful because that it's supposed to be prepared the way they prepare it and you're supposed to enjoy it so sometimes you're not supposed to season is all you're supposed to take it as is that is what it is and it can be even offensive because you're telling the chef hey\nYou didn't do it right I'm going to add to it not take that into loose the sentence\nAnd expand on that to the concept of salvation and you're going out at you know it's good to definitely cross everything you did God I'm just going to pepper it just a little bit with baptism\nMm Mm Mm Mm [noise]\n\n\nJesus Christ and show will return in a moment to

Dr Ford brought forth in her letter\nI just found it interesting that she the discrepancy that she couldn't remember where she was the evening of the alleged incidents how she got there how she got home but he quit he named the Montgomery County or the county of Montgomery County in her letter\nAnd I just thought that was interesting got me thinking I'm from that area I grew up in that area I graduated in Nineteen eighty five and I lived in the same town as she did and I know that the party that those that we had our kids had back then could happen in Maryland but it also happened in Washington DC or northern Virginia\nThose private schools draw kids from all around the DC metropolitan area so it's funny that she mentioned you know Montgomery County specifically although not\nAny clue where in Montgomery County and um I looked into a little bit and saw the statute of limitations does not expired in Montgomery County Maryland however he let me see or northern Virginia they would've expired so\nI'm Wondering if she's trying to hold herself to be able to turn this if something goes criminal let that she had some sort of case to hold onto\nYeah listen I I tend to agree with you um I don't know I think it's very problematic that all four people and I'm again we've been trying to be fair as we can be here\nAnd the Senate Judiciary committee talked to all the quote

now that's what they're saying and remember she admitted she quickly became a ... she had gaps in her memory foggy slurring of words\nSo that's what the Democrats are citizens are credible allegation well if it was so incredible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of them\nLast week 'cause they they they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to\nThen we've got the the third incident which is the ... case where a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been the ten of these parties herself personally\nThat there was Brett Kavanaugh one and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a a whole series of allegations he looked at as Byron York said the gold polls have moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people that but not just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein had this for six long weeks she had this back in July there was a California state or California congressman that had it early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh\nThen of course we had the original hearings\nAnd not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is the lawyer that represents professor Ford but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's\nRadical left political the attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week\nOf a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sending to the right\nOf professor forward or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they were soliciting women to accused judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety and this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope\nThey were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape\nAnd one email sent a late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart\nAn all girls school near Georgetown Prep with the subject line corroboration needed never cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by break cabin on his year book page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F\nA wording in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit pleased contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted to delay for\nNow if it was truly limited in scope and we know that in the case of professor poured that there were four people she mentioned we're at this party\nSome don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was at the end of the you know that when the perjury I mean ... under the penalty of ... felony here\nSo they all signed these affidavits all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection and the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event\nThat eye witness has said under penalty of a felony that it never happened what professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put\nMark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident so I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond\nSee whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements\n... there's nothing else really left for them to do please use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting you know randomly anybody\nTo come forward please please come forward\nAnd then the hope is that there will be delayed again and again and again and\nYou know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week now is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yeah who knows what Dianne Feinstein owes\nThen the only thing they've got is well didn't commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank\nYou know did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out now he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking bureau lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to have blacked out as an I worked as a bartender for a number of years\nI Know a lot about alcohol I watched it up close and personal\nYou know everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose it for some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and other throw him out and they'd be walking straight\nHaving been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individual individual is just it's an enormous you know you see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all\nI learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter\nUm anyway so we got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time any uh was I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today\nAnd he said that he's a pollster was the Clintons pollster and he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he found is the support for professor Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning of one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by Remington research group because the election is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader of the United States Senate\nBecause that's what the Democrats want now this doesn't\nIf this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of six tests the president has it it it diminishes any chance they have but getting back their power\nAnd after two years of trying to destroy the president you know they want a Christian do their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we've got this election you're going to tune in at night and you're going to flip the channels and you got to be watching news channels and you're either going to be seeing happy anchors all over the country or you're gonna once again shocked the world and you're going to defy the odds and you're sick of their agenda\nThere's blood thinning of Kavanaugh this the agenda just destroy Trump\nThe

is now evolved into Democratic senators\nOh the FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against judge Brett Kavanaugh\nBy the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last week if they want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we've got to interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including that anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI\nHad to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of this left wing attorney that's representing professor forward that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remembered Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professor Ford\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women to accuse\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt this is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we got delayed like we wanted now are we going to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a

describing how much he drank so they're spreading a wider\nAnd frankly at an age when Justice Ginsburg was very political and some attacks on President Trump Democrats are trying out\nJudicial temperament of this whole thing is it is character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country uh and it is it tells us who they are I mean I think the key to the election this fall is which America do you want to be\nDo you really want to be an America where somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage and then get smeared on ending Lee was totally uncorroborated assaults does that sound really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as could be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beer then

behalf of the Dianne Feinstein recommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats\nSending out letters saying ah we're we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is\nThis has nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge count on\nThis is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassinate me or cheat I mean when you when you have\nWhen you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to

there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nAnd I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused of

know what the significant or\nNormal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me let me play historian from it because\nI spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through when you know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you

having me on a budget talk around there earlier um I grew up watching a and you cannot cross by reminded me and my dad who were just you just died a few weeks ago and so I think you'd be happy recalling him getting on to your show so\nI appreciate it you know cross fire was a defining show in the history of political debate in the country and and Pat Buchanan and breathing in all those original guys there was an amazing show at a time\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those types of shows them the doing of things that people want to mock now but I'm\nIn any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation a number one personal where conservatives we have a moral compass if we if we do detect that there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one is that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans do investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use the power to investigate everything that's going on here\nAnd potentially witness was being coaxed ally people being put forward to sign false affidavits\nThere's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the public as we are going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't think you look if we're going to be fair if they really cared about the issue then they'd be asking ah what about Keith Ellison and why would they supportive of Bill Clinton where's Juanita brought her ex FBI investigation they don't want\nAny of these things because it's not the issue with politics the greatest evidence that his politics anyway appreciate the call of the latest on Brett Kavanaugh Carrie Severino is going to join us next we're going to spend\nA lotta time taking your calls final hour the program news roundup information overload our as we continue from Washington Hannity tonight we've got a very important show nine eastern

people so this could be for you a way to pay health care bills that's not only very smart financially but it's even profound Medicare is a nonprofit with four hundred thousand members nationwide to

we're told doesn't matter\nRush Limbaugh mornings and I found the patriots am eleven fifty [noise]\nSixteen year old and we did not do that and I think that's wrong I think it's a bad idea to show our kids to save up for pay for half their car a match whatever they say and they had to save up and pay for half of it when you pay for half of it will pay for any of it they cause you drive a different way to keep it clean and bump into stuff was often\nHave Ramsey show these days is three on the patriots am eleven fifty\n\nI had a stroke kitten being well this is high blood pressure get back on

light on Capitol Hill Brett\nOf these allegations whatsoever member that anyway well Deborah Katz is the one that well she didn't really believe Paula Jones and she did take Al Franken side\nAnd you know as you know you just you've got to watch this it there's no end to this now they are not going to stop until they get a no vote on Brecht capital that's just this this should not surprise anybody\nAnd Jeff Flake is now in Massachusetts today trying to run for president thinking he's going to which by the way it is a way to do it you don't like Trump go be the\nEnd thirty six days Democrats they'll make their case and they're going to ask you to give the house of representatives to Nancy Pelosi and the Senate but the Democrats\nThe Chuck Schumer if that's what you want on election night in thirty six days and you want to turn on the TV and find out the results if you stay home well you'll get the government you deserve we always do do you want all progress that we have now\nAchieved in two years to stop that will happen too but all the senators saying well no no no we got to limit the scope it it's got to be very quick expeditious and and just have the FBI do this that's not what they ever intended they want this to drag on through the mid term elections\nIn the hope that Donald Trump doesn't get to make is Supreme Court nomination\nAnyway joining us now is Carrie Severino she's the chief counsel and policy director for the Judicial Crisis network a welcome back to the program as well as predicted the bar has shifted\nAnd now the Democrats won an extensive FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor Ford there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now all four of them probably work\nI'd I'd sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to\nThat to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to hire an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she works at that at every Democrat that it's now they're going up the Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be this horrible partisan organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here on the line\n[noise] take your mind that you're doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on that you know someone who clerk for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted the name of this couch them because they disagree with in any way\nOn and he is someone who it does ... incredible amount of respect on the bench\nKavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge the Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they walk to fourteen different times they've found now they've vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk a part in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are have but I like it\nIf you write all the parents to do on a reputation now if you read James\nComey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's packet in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI don't love the upper brass on their Khomeini and the cave and struck and pay the FBI is is the FBI people I Know the salt of the earth people and I said I of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn Carolyn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them and you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says if you look he he told me coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate as their ... with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not\nThey've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list of people the Senate Judiciary committee had already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing 'cause the FBI can't as ... as well make that cap force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they couldn't be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything you to hear that there there's like prediction\nTurned it around the IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate her story and then saying that Mrs Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking the other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigating\nThem people she's not even still share it with him she said what positive it in the room [laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but\nYeah they are starting to get hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyer for six days to kind of work up\nA ... her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I I'm a tractor even counting the cut about ... you know what go for the FBI could talk to her\nAnd they'll they'll get their state in it and I think if you look at the people out there\nThan I got older you get a whole new wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those three oh two we've been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and and what was said in those conversations are Carrie Severino is with

you're ... you're losing the burden or read yourself but the burden of facing the voters will now you're going to be who you really are that's what it sounds like to me which kind of as an admission that you've been dishonest the whole time and so I have a suggestion if this is a\nTrial balloon and he's thinking about running for president would get get in the game go run you know there's a way to get Supreme Court nominees through and that is you can become the president then you can pick your own person and you can do what you think is best then you can be\nAs boring as you want to be as
