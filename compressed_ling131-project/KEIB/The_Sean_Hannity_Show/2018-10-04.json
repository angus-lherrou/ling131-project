{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "Well it's only ten or twelve minutes\nTwelve minutes he dropped his parents and said kiss it\nReally that's not a problem for Deborah cats are defending Al Franken anyway we'll see in the political fallout of all of this now is Kavanaugh's now the president's approval rating has an all time high at fifty percent today and the president laying out the facts in this particular\nCase we've got an election in thirty three days\nAnd every poll is now showing that the Senate races in the enthusiasm gap is heightened dramatically and significantly which is the right thing why because\nI think the American people are learning a lot that this is the Democratic party playbook\nIs a party that doesn't believe in due process or a presumption of innocence there's a party that regularly smears Flanders\nUses character assassination character blood Janine all in the process to gain their own power is not one agenda item that you can cite any Democrat that they're running on and thirty three days that's going to make the country a better place\nThey don't seem to care at all at what they've done with judge Kavanaugh or when you look at the evidence and you look at the facts as the FBI did now they're attacking the FBI what do you find out is that there is zero corroboration\nTo the claims of all three women in the ... not even including\nThe cases of outright lying that were dismissed early on about judge Kavanaugh they just dismiss it altogether but\nNone of this would ever make it into any court of law and there might actually end up being significant legal consequences to Julie sweat Nick and some other people based on what Alan Dershowitz and others saying should happen\nBecause of the things that they said the backtracking that took place and perhaps even lying\nUnder the threat of a felony anyway news roundup information overload our Jonathan Gillum author of sheep do more Danielle McLaughlin is with us um I don't know if this was going to impact the election and thirty three days but I think it certainly has energized every\nEvery part of the Republican coalition that recognizes this for the grave injustice that it's banned in the smear campaign that has been Jonathan\nWhy Korea and you know where I I think this has definitely\nCause I'm some good reactions and conservatives across this nation I'm also a free thinking or people who used to subscribe to the Democrats are the Democrats' way of thinking are are now saying this is this isn't really politics this is\nI'm kind of criminal behavior the way a wad of this stuff is playing out in Washington DC right now we're going to be the dark thing that we've seen 'em or whether it be just the sheer way that the FBI has been used and I think what's happening is\nIt's solidify and people that they don't want to play this game and people are starting to get on the same bandwagon I Do think it's going to have a huge outcome and the election I think that people are going to say they're tired of this nonsense it's on the west um they may not agree with everything on the right but I think it's going to cause\nBacklash you're going to defend Europe the love liberal democratic socialist party Danielle\nThat's right he had a great show on on that could happen any everybody at selling it to be here I I honestly I Want to tell you that there's going to be at the backlash on the left as well you know um there are concerns about ah the nominee a they're a consensus investigation wasn't\nDial cave but others say anyway hurdle we've heard all the allegations\nYou know that professor forward so called eye witness was contradicted her\nTestimony and her accusation we know in the case of ... Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody could corroborate her story number one\nNumber two or own words that she was a ... D quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before\nAnd that this Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yelled classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug or and rapist of teenage girls would give me the evidence and cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from your Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not do and I don't think it was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week wait a minute what everybody's talking and it\nWas a full and fair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I didn't know and the FBI did\nNot use I mean why every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week\nInterviewed dozens of people and then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself and then we all watched Julie sweat Nick alter shift\nAnd backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so you have any cooperation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not getting any education that I don't expect that you would expect that I did\nBut I Know you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of corroborate ration people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that happen that way at all\nSo the judge is our culture and that thing on at the last twenty four hours a king about ah the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible ... predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do show they sound like it or something\nOf course I Believe and the and the and the presumption of innocence but I also have to leave that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair investigation and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge outcry and I understand that this is energizing itchy out hey\nI notice a talking point what was on a second I Want you interview\nLooking in the case of professor Ford before\nPeople she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do because we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there got home from their what else is the FBI to do that already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... at the FBI just\nTo see what else can they certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when we don't know huh\nOK okay she thinks the fact that she doesn't run into where I where and when exactly it's not necessarily\nDon't you know you're you're trying to what you're trying to ... look follow the bounds you have all the ...\nIf there's four people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got there we don't know how she got home\nWe don't even know the house which you mentioned four people were there for people under penalty of felony all said that didn't happen the way she said\nOne witness or didn't happen and my question is what the FBI do if they don't know the location that can't be looking parenthetically for anything quick break we'll come back more with Jonathan Gillum and Daniel McLaughlin here on the Sean Hannity show\nHey I Want to talk about your whole security protecting your

our phones as we say Hi first Brandon is in Colorado Brandon Hi how are you glad you called and welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nHey thanks Sean I grew up in spent most of my life in Arizona where my family's still is and I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a\nA good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that you'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday it sounds\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it's just you know I I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a see good people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain I feel like that's kind of happening with Jeff as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he may was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters again [laughter] ... not um and I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I\nI just look at a guy that can't doesn't know his own mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the\nSame guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you don't look at him and uh you'll find that funny Sean but we were actually related I think it's for three or four generations back our great great something grandfather is actually the founder of snowflake Arizona which I thought you would really love\nTo know somebody told me that yes it was really no there is a snowflake Arizona senator Snowe for like um I Hope it goes the right thing\nIf any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delayed they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations\nAnd they're not going to offer opinions here and all they are going to do is give you a straight data and that's what it was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start\nYou know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it's it is so ... it's so dark um I was having a conversation with a friend of mine who's religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\n... shall not their falls witness against the neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and\nA media hysteria that that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people with a new window falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that they've come out as a matter of of course because that's their play book I don't know I um I I some house at some point we may need to examine libel laws at some point we may need to say\nIf you're going to make
