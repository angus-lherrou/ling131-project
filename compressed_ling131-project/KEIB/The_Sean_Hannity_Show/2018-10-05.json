New York times reported they could find no one with first hand knowledge nobody\nTimes doesn't like Donald Trump\nAnd then they also pointed out a bit of information that was a little bit scary and they found out that Mr Ramirez herself had been contacting former yell classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them that she could not be certain if Mr\nCab and all was the one who exposed himself well I hate to say it based on her own words that point that's it that cases over add to it\nHer own admission achieve quickly became a ... and ... that the party that she was foggy slurring her words and admitting in her own words that she had significant memory gaps from the evening so the New York times couldn't corroborate the stories and of course we've got\nDoor number three allegation number three and that was the case of Julie sweat Nick as soon as the woman that is being represented by the attorney of the year for the Democratic party Michael em Ali\nAnyway a lot of credibility issues as it relates to her and we saw all of her allegations blow up the sheep backtrack big time on her story in an interview that I don't think ever should've aired on NBC News because she gave the names of for people that she said would be able to corroborate her story and\nWell they couldn't find two of them or they wouldn't respond one is dead and the other one said she ... they don't even know who Julie sweating it is I've never heard of this person\nSo that story fell apart and\nHad an ex boyfriend that had found a restraining order against her and ... and I'm not going to go through a whole bunch of credibility issues that she has you know I have a lot of facts evidence of what she's saying is not true at all from a former boyfriend and oh anyway and that was the third allegation where are you supposed to go\nFrom here and I remember Mr sweat neck was claiming that on a regular basis almost weekly weekend basis it almost happened on the weekend basis\nThat these boys including\nBrett Kavanaugh as a teenager in high school that they were regularly happened often almost every weekend she was a time of the parties that they were literally drugging girls against their will making sure they got an ... capacity hated and that\nThey would line up in the halls of the boys and the boys were then\nGang rape these girls and it happened again almost on a weekend basis and then it became in the interview well I don't know if he's spike the punch shy but I saw him give out red solo cups once and I saw him near the punch bowl and\nLining up in the home I I I didn't they weren't exactly lined up in the hall but I saw him in a whole\nIt's just not anything that would hold up anywhere under any significant scrutiny\nAnd the FBI has done the best that they can do and it's interesting that all the people that have been demanding all these FBI investigations they don't want an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nAnd number two guy at the DNC always

that we're told and stories that were created and pushed into the media\nBut if you if we're now going to convict people based on\nAccusation guilt by accusation or as Spartacus Cory Booker said well I mean if there's enough accusations you they can't put them on the court well based on his own words when he was a teenager which I've read on this program he doesn't belong as a U.S senator\nFrom my home is just beyond the vicious porn some rancor that is going on beyond\nThe accusation we don't fight of what the moral moment is about control and also when we ask ourselves western if it's the

corroborate professor Ford's allegation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee\nHe said there's nothing in the FBI supplemental background check\nTheir corroborate claims from Ford which drew Kavanaugh's nomination into turmoil and he said he agrees with his fellow GOP Senator Susan Collins and viewing the FBI report as thorough and failing the backup boards claims that Kavanaugh

I think is a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her\nHer country with incredible honor and distinction and and Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but these numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy I suppose that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nAll that it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive\nThe enthusiasm gap does is closed almost two dead even hauled and you see Republicans and important Senate races now and dead heat in all of the states that are red states where where Democrats which Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go stage further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they meet your\nIt everything you can imagine and they lost and I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process\nHe may well have crippled his party or a generation a good friend of mine

I just don't think people are Americans\nAre going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we have been living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this with certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever the vista nature of politics they could bring up comes up every election year but they have now son to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor Ford there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nTo to look for anything for ... that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talk to the four people were passer Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eyewitness that that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just going to jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's enough allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think at a real future as a reformer who is just sort of decayed I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks with any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I found it painful um\nHe he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy a thin the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that\nYou know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good

two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWell he has put your finger on the key

I. investigations remember last week well we'll just have a limited in scope and will do it in a week and we'll trust the FBI and now they didn't get back what they wanted\nThe problem they their problem is much bigger they're never going to get to the answer that they're so hoping for and the three cases that they've been using to me or slander and bludgeon judge Kavanaugh and his family\nYou know what professor forward she has mentioned for people none of them remember the party and the I witnessed she placed in the room at the time of the alleged attack\nSaid they did not ever happen ever\nIn the case of Mr Ramirez the New York times even said they called dozens and dozens of people and they weren't able to get one corroborating witness not one\nAnd the New York times hates Donald Trump would have loved to come out with the smoking gun article that destroyed judge Kavanaugh and they even pointed out something that should concern everybody\nThat Mrs Ramirez was calling her former yell classmate said well I don't remember I'm not sure do you think it might be judge Kavanaugh that and of course then gaps in her memory and being ... and early\nAnd I don't even want to get into the whole issue of Julie sweating it can you know she goes on NBC News why this ever got reported is beyond any\nUnderstanding that I have changed your story backtracking from a story in a multitude of ways mentioning that there are four eyewitnesses in her case one dead and the number two person has no idea of who she is no idea at all\nAnd the allegation that on almost on a weekend basis that young boys were drugging young women and lining up in the halls and then raping gang raping these young women\nAnd then ... then to well I'm well Brett Kavanaugh I saw it near the punch bowl so it may be probably was one of them and he gave out red solo cups I saw them give out red solo cups so it wasn't lined up in the hall but he was in the hall I saw him in a hole and nobody\nElse can corroborated they wouldn't never getting the answer that they want it because they've all known as the smear so now they're just\nMe or the FBI investigators in this case that did what they were supposed to do there never was going to be a recommendation or a conclusion made by the FBI we learned that from Joe Biden in Nineteen Ninety One\nBut that wasn't the purpose of any of this their whole their dream their prayer was that the FBI would find the smoking gun that didn't exist based on the accusers own words in each Pacific case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlave more tortured they want to lift returned America into Venezuela that how you get people like Cortez winning primaries in New York so\nRock bottom adjust the just endorsed Cortez\nYes he does that mean in his list them forty of those people call themselves socialist but there's a very simple message or let's go to mark and\nLooked at Brett Kavanaugh's record for every ... he's been alive well the fifty years this clean record in fact he's not\nJust as worker was green and he'll Seventeen Days ago right spotlight relatives have been ... days ago\nAnd if the the the conclusions of our ship or if they can do this to this map they can do it to anybody including to the list of your show if you get in the way the Democratic party they will try to destroy you and your family and your reputation\nNobody on winter we all three of us all of us\nHave been through these ... years and attacks I've been through it Dr Gorka you've been through it Monica you're getting through it I remember calling Monica ... I don't even remember what they were attacking you about to be honest\nAnd I remember saying a well welcome to the club it's part of the forest hang in there and when you were in the middle of it it's not that much fun and a lot of people are making phone calls to you\nKnow and when you're over the talk show\n... that that's exactly right Sean and like if you're conservative your target but if you were a pro Trump conservative now you got about a hundred targets on you anybody stands up for this president what he's doing his agenda anybody who is the associate it with have nominated\nBy hand eye supportive of hand you are a target and the president himself is a great role model because she's the strongest political leader I'd ever seen and and judge Kavanaugh God Bless him because he was getting more than any\nProfessor for to hire a radical left wing attorney who attacked Paula Jones well it's only ten or twelve minutes\nHer twelve minutes he dropped his parents and said kiss it really that's not a problem\nFor Deborah cats are defending Al Franken anyway we'll see in the political fallout of all of this now is Kavanaugh's now the president's approval rating is an all time high at fifty percent today and the president laying out the facts in this particular case we've got an election in thirty three days\nAnd every poll is now showing that the Senate races and the enthusiasm gap is heightened dramatically and significantly which is the right thing why because\nI think the American people learning a lot that this is the Democratic party playbook\nIs a party that doesn't believe in due process or a presumption of innocence there's a party that regularly smears Flanders\nUses character assassination character blood Janine all in a process to gain their own power is not one agenda item that you can cite any Democrat that they're running on and thirty three days that's going to make the country a better place\nThey don't seem to care at all at what they've done with\nJudge Kavanaugh or when you look at the evidence and you look at the facts as the FBI did and now they're attacking the FBI what do you find out is that there's zero corroboration\nTo the claims of all three women in the ... not even including\nThe cases of outright lying that were dismissed early on about judge Kavanaugh\nThey just dismiss it altogether but\nNone of this would ever make it into any court of law and there might actually end up being significant legal consequences to Julie sweat Nick and some other people based on what Alan Dershowitz and others saying should happen because of the things that they said the backtracking that took place and perhaps even lying\nUnder the threat of a felony anyway news roundup information overload our Jonathan Gillum author of sheep no more Danielle McLaughlin is with us\nUm I don't know if this was going to impact the election and thirty three days but I think it certainly has energized every every part of the Republican coalition that recognizes this for the grave injustice that it's banned in the smear campaign that has been Jonathan\nWhy Korea and you know I think this has definitely caused um some good reactions and conservatives across this nation I'm also a free thinking or people who used to subscribe to the Democrats\nAre the Democrats' way of thinking are are now saying this is this isn't really politics this is\nI'm kind of criminal behavior the way a wad of this stuff is playing out in Washington DC right now or whether it be the dark thing that we've seen 'em or whether it be just the sheer way that the FBI has been used and I think what's happening is it's solidify and people that\nThey don't want to play this game and people are starting to get on the bandwagon I Do think it's going to have a huge outcome and the election I think that people are going to say they're tired of this nonsense it's on the west um they may not agree with everything on the right but I think it's going to cause a backlash\nAre you going to defend Europe the love liberal democratic socialist party Danielle\n... he had to get Sean I could opt in any everybody excited to be here I I honestly I Want to tell you that there's going to be a backlash on the left as wild you know um there are concerns about ah the nominee are there a consensus investigation wasn't\nDial ... ... let's say anyway hurdle we've heard all the allegations\nYou know that professor Ford's so called eye witness was contradicted her testimony and her accusation\nWe know in the case of ... Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber two or own words that she was a ... D quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before and\nThat Mrs Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yo classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug or and rapist of teenage girls would give me the evidence and cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from you Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not don't yeah I and I don't mind it was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week wait a minute what everybody's talking hunted\nWith the falling ... getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I think now and the FBI did\nUse I mean why every main person that was mentioned\nIn the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmates and I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself and then we all watched Julie sweat Nick all third shift\nAnd backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so you have any crop rotation for any of these incidents at all\nI Know during the negotiations that I don't expect that you would expect that I did\nBut I Know you're following of the ... you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of corroborate and people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that happened that way at all\nSo the judges are college room at the end on that and the last twenty four hours a smoking about ah the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible president predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do show that you sound like it or something\nOf course I Believe in the ... and the and the presumption of innocence but also the late that the FBI should have been allowed to do a full and fair investigation and that is why you're going to see on the ... a huge up for a while and I understand that this is energizing itchy out hey\nI Know I was not talking point what was on a second I Want you interview looking in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one I witnessed says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do is we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there I got home from their what else did the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nBut if you take the emotion out of it and you look at the investigative facts there are none and there is not going to be any because it doesn't matter\nWho you question the very people that are the the the alleged victim claims were the closest to the to the electric crime don't know anything\nAnd so as you go out in a perimeter away from the people who the victim says was was there and you interview other people that may have heard somebody say something or hurt here say it becomes here say you know that from being in court that\nWhen you have a just eight minutes with no corroborating evidence\nThe case quickly falls to the side\nAnd I certainly agree with Jonathan totally and the problem is that in and also the fact that the FBI is being used outside of their authority for a political matter and that scares me as a former FBI agent that scares me\nBecause that is the that's the thing that totalitarian I'm a governments do\nLook I agree I think the one thing that's important she got back to this was a standard here this is not a criminal investigation out this is an investigation and to conduct\nThat may or may not have bearing on way to get a lifetime appointment um and I understand and I agree that this is a kind of extreme like political and extremely emotional and I can get ...\nQuestion do you have any corroborating witness for any corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nThat isn't on the question that as an unseen\nReally I got an unfair question Jonathan I don't think it's unfair to them\nWell I think when we say fair or unfair I think what it is I Want you to make question I'll tell you why didn't you know because\nPeople are so again angry and people are saying I Believe her I Believe him but in this case there's just no other witnesses there's no other evidence and so when you're asked if you feel this passionate about something if somebody says\nWhat other information do you have that legitimate question because there is not and the FBI who was secrete it into this investigation has come up with non either and I can guarantee you if anybody would have ... ... it would be them\nRight and our inside there is no robbery evidence as to where the judge was on any given day with the he was there and I think I think people are emotional for for ...\nAnybody actually has a copy of is summer calendar that year but we don't have an exact day anyway so right right and you know what you're saying is that you know he has to prove his innocence or is the innocent before proven be ... they haven't been proven guilty what what do you believe in\nIs innocent until proven guilty again this\nIs so he hasn't been proven guilty and you know has he he has not been proven guilty and it's gone on a long time\nNot to a legal standard that would be required ... absolutely not but I don't believe that it's a stand if yeah and I write\nThank you both we appreciate it eight hundred ... all one

say hyper Brandon is in Colorado Brandon Hi how are you glad you called and welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nHey thanks Sean I grew up and spent most of my life in Arizona where my family's still and I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a\nA good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that you'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday challenge\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it just you know I I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a see good people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain and I feel like it's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he may was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he had an absolutely not um I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I\nI just look at a guy that can't doesn't know was old mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the\nSame guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you don't look at him and uh you'll find this funny Sean but we were actually related or I think it for three or four generations back our great great something grandfather it was actually the founder of snowflake Arizona which I thought you would really love\nTo know somebody told me that yesterday I'm practically really though there is a snowflake Arizona senator Snowe for like um I Hope it goes the right thing\nIf any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delayed they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations and they're not going to offer opinions here and all they are going to do is give you a straight data and that's what was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims\nAs we've been claiming and as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start it you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it's it is so ... it's so dark I'm having a conversation with a friend of mine who's religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\n... shall not their falls witness against a neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and\nA media hysteria that that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people with innuendo falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that come out as a matter of of course because that's their playbook I don't know I um I I\nSome house at some point we may need to examine libel laws at some point we may need to say\nIf you're going to make these girl as accusations against individuals you better be able to prove it because if you can't prove it then you ought to be held financially liable because\nMade me stop and ... how many of your let me just ask you how many of you have ever made up your mind on who to vote for based on a TV ad I never\nNot I don't watch local TV that much but I Know that I Am not\nA good example of a cross section of the country a lot of people watch local TV and as such are inundated with political ads and we keep hearing people are tired of\nThem but they keep running them because of the political consultants believe that they work\nBut this is an area where I don't have a lot in common with with the people in this regard\nAnd it it leads to being a constant frustration for me I Am never influenced by the money spent on the campaign particularly campaign ads it and that doesn't affect me I Know who I'm going to vote for before I see an ad and there's not an ad in the world that's going to make me change my mind\n\nBut I have to keep in mind how rare that is most people watch\nLocal TV they can avoid all those ads and a lot of\nPeople are not immersed than this stuff like I Am and maybe you too and so they are influenced by these ads I have to keep reminding myself\nThat these ads and the the spending of a voluminous amounts of money does matter\nI just I have a tough time I see how people who pay attention to things could even think about voting Democrat right now I I folks I really mean it I think\nGiven what we've seen since Trump was elected a Democrat Party and the deep state deserve the biggest electoral landslide loss ever\nThis country needs to rise up and reject these people I Know their voters are not going to reject them but\nI don't believe that the majority I think these people need to be skunk their behavior\nIs in terms of decency common decency these people must not be rewarded for what they're doing destroying people destroying institutions destroying concepts in our rule of\nLaw I shudder to think of them being rewarded for this stuff\nYou know it used to be that you know the economy was great just by living through it but now you apparently have to be told that it's good you have to be watching TV and then somebody on TV has to tell you the economy's\nGood then you have to believe it well I remember a time where when the economy was roaring along and people were doing well did you didn't need to be told you know it but now we got the Democratic party out there saying it's not a great economy tax cuts are ruining everything [noise]\nAnd some don't cops believe this stuff\n[noise] you you reject what you're living and believe what you're being told by ... [noise] so I just I have I have yet to be influenced by a political ad now I realize\nI'm very firm in like infections and I know what I Believe but there's not an ad in the world is going to change my mind about\nA candidate one other thing I get along the lines of what are the Democrats going to do if Kavanaugh gets confirmed I told you they're going to double down and they're going to keep harassing and they're not going to stop trying to get rid of this guy I have just a little bit of anecdotal evidence to back it up I have a tweet here actually to\nFrom a woman who works at the

and maybe they would act right\nShe sounds like everybody's first ex wife\nIf they knew they would get yelled at for the rest of their lives and maybe they would act right [noise] these people are going to get hounded [noise] I think they're going to get out of no matter what they do if they're not Democrats they are going to get out of no matter what they do man up back after this\nMakes it

that\nHave that chance that he has been an exemplary public servants judge teacher cos husband\nJust by the turbulent bitter fight surrounding his nomination my fervent hope\nIs that Brett Kavanaugh\nWill work less than that division in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer five or just say the sun and so that's public confidence in our judiciary and our highest court\nIs restart Mr President I Will vote\nChicken for judge Kavanaugh [noise] they give to [noise]\n\nI think one of the more amazing speeches and I I Am now it's actually interesting because as a tomorrow I Begin my twenty third year on the Fox\nNews channel and my Thirty years on radio that was one of the most thoughtful speeches I think I've ever heard and I'm frankly shocked I'm Susan\nCollins over the years is frustrated the living daylights out of me were opinion so I think what stands out more than\nAnything else is the the students here come the amount of gravity that she gave to her decision and her speech\nAnd the gravity of the moment and and the un bringing literally\nA sense of sanity to what has become an absolute so she said circus around the country\nAnd systematically went over every single aspect of her decision making process from judge Kavanaugh his judicial temperament\nThe questions that he specifically answered her passion about uh especially didn't I disagree with her on on roe v Wade but on the issue of constitutional precedence the role of advice and consent\nAnd the respect that she is showing the constitution the process and the whole process of a role of what it means to give advice and consent\nNow with Susan Collins a yes and Jeff Flake saying he is a yes on camera and all that now brings us to well Lisa Murkowski stimulate use ... know that brings those two fifty\nA what forty nine fifty one forty nine yeah so that brings us to forty nine\nSo really all comes down to I guess at this point Joe mansion and Lisa Murkowski and Lisa Murkowski appears to be a no win I guess mansion could be the yes\nIs our math right on this who else is outstanding at this point 'cause everybody else I think is on record\nYeah\nNo I've got to believe I think Joe Manchin by the way I don't think it'll be a surprise he voted just two\nTwo and a to start the debate the thirty hours final vote a that'll happen mansion well here we go we just broke mentioned is voting yesterday confirmed judge capital the votes of their pores the Danes as that is supposed to walk his daughter down the aisle tomorrow in the middle of this vote\nI don't know how they're going to work that out somebody better lend them a a private plane was so kind to get them over there\nUm what I had mired I think the most about this speech is the pressure under which Susan Collins has been\nThere is literally a main going on now and by the way Maine is not exactly one of the most expensive media markets but she talked in the beginning at length about the process and what this has now become a and talk about it being a a got a political campaign\nAnd millions of dollars and people in groups of people pledging to destroy her into feed her an upcoming elections et cetera\nAnd um wow this is pretty amazing\nWas just an amazing speech eight hundred nine four one showing us auto for telephone number Lindsey Graham is going to join us now at the bottom of the hour or I mentioned voting yes late voting yes and now Susan Collins voting yes which means the votes are there to confirmed judge Kavanaugh\nI Want to remind you if you have any sunspots over the summer I mean in plain

I don't really get the sense after reading his statement in hearing what are you saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today\nUh that that really might impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons as well as articulated by\nSenator Collins and what was the most riveting one hour speech is I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something and how she systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent the meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers\nUm what it means ah the whole issue in process of\nOf a presumption of innocence and and how important it is to society or even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade in precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought a level of of seriousness and sobriety to the entire debate\nI I just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney Greg Jarrett\nFox News legal analyst author of the number one bestseller the Russian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if you have the same reaction I did I was I was stunned I I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant\nA ... with uncommon eloquence and sound reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a compelling legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important that at the outset\nCollins condemn the outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote is concerned and and I I the best part of what she said\nUh was re counting many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate that even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations\nAnd said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent\nDuty and she announced her own standard for considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers you know in the civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence or and she said it wasn't there there\nA rock sex life on the patriots am eleven fifty\n...

the most powerful speech\nIn recent memory on the Senate floor that I've ever seen it was Thoreau it was sober it was smart it was thought full it was comprehensive\nShe went through everything from judicial temperament and philosophy to her own belief system how she came to her decisions are constitutional view on the Supreme Court\nOn the role of advice and consent on the madness and the circus that has broken out in this country\nAnd um I I have I I'm frankly I we never run an entire commercial free our unless it's really important news and we did that for you to our beloved audience because it was something that I wanted everybody to hear\nThis is a moment in history what has happened in the last Eighteen days can't continue to happen in this country you cannot bludgeon people without any corroborating evidence weighed judge Kavanaugh and his family have been bludgeoned\nYou can have political differences and I've had my share with senator Collins over the years\nWe're really realize today is I don't know her well\nShe doesn't do a lot of television she's not somebody I've interviewed a lot like the most impressive thing that I took away from this is the seriousness the intellect\nThe the systematic she walked every American through her decision making process and frankly it was flawless it was spectacular\nNothing shorter spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money and then it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her conscience on this issue and she is ... ... it was obvious\nShe missed nothing she had followed every single solitary detail of this process\nDid all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative and and\nNow I guess the left is about as unhinged they'd been I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate halls at this point\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina I Would argue it would not have happened but for him and he joins us on our news maker line um you know you told me something when I was in Washington earlier this week and I asked you I said well what are you know about Susan Collins and you'd\nYou basically described what I learned about her today I was blown away and I don't get blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I've been in radio Thirty years I'm a tomorrow I start my twenty third year in the Fox

differences but Jeff Flake also is that yes\nJeff Flake or is on the other side of a lot of things with Trump but he rose to the occasion and say listen\nI Want to hear more but I'm inclined to believe what I Believe\nI Want to hear from Dr Ford he listened to you also listen to ... and the process her and Susan and Susan ... gonna make Kevin ... better nominee more legitimate nominee so I Want to thank him too but in the end of the day this is about a person a single person\nWho is sort of the odd person out in politics\nRising to the ... and being that giant and to the extent I did my part thank you I wanted to stand up for a good man 'cause I've known him for Twenty years uh I wanted to let everybody in the country now have despicable in my eyes he was being treated and that they

important midterm election in our lifetime\nYour tax savings is on the ballot\nThe American economy is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot in your kid's futures\nAnd their jobs on the ballot or wages for one cage all of this is on the ballot and if you're a small business owner well your tax cuts are on the ballot also and here's the biggest political issue on the ballot who's in charge of

latest details more coming up straight ahead [noise]\n\nHi Michelle mocking here one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor Kermit cause now\nThat's done so much in so little time two years no administrations come from [noise]\nAnd when we went through a lot of that success earlier in the program and a lot of it bears repeating by the way I mean these are ... for a million jobs created since the election more Americans now employed\nThan ever recorded in our history unemployment the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine four hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs those are the jobs Obama's that never coming back\nBy the way things are only going to get better with the explosion in the energy sector\nOnce they can get up and online and Anwar and and continue coal mining the president's saving the coal mining industry in West Virginia singlehandedly\nAnd once we continue to extract more natural gas in the world would ever needed in three hundred years we have all of those ... resources and fourteen states record low unemployment\nA record low unemployment for Hispanic Americans African Americans Asian Americans youth unemployment fifty five year low median household income\nIts highest record ever recorded\nYou know we have the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for Americans without even a high school diploma and veterans' unemployment has now reached the slowest rate in Twenty years\nAnd four million people off of food stamps and I can just keep on going and promises about the types of judges he put on the court and gutting endless\nBureaucratic regulation that that literally hamstrings all businesses in America\nPromoting buying in hiring America actively promoting and asking people to come and build their factories in manufacturing centers here and creating the economic conditions\nAnd the regulatory conditions where it's possible I mean that's why all these manufacturing jobs are coming back or reducing illegal immigration courts defeating ISIS you know of course pulling out of that idiotic Iranian deal and\nRocket man not firing a missile over Japan every other day I'd say that's pretty good but with\nThirty two days out of the electorate a lot can happen between now and then John McLaughlin as pollster founder McLaughlin associates Doug Jones is with us also a pollster author political analyst for Fox News\nI thank you both for being with us or we can see I don't know if you want to call the cabin on balance or the cabinet awakening there's in every single state now Claire McCaskill is down significantly in the latest poll in Missouri\nJoe Donnelly is in trouble in Indiana Heidi Heitkamp is down and eleven in her state of North Dakota or I say that Rick Scott will be the next senator from Florida and then of course Martha ... has been surging lately uh where do you think it stands at this moment John McLaughlin\n... I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's three gauge whether Trump voters a short you know you're done and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited millions of voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday or those voters were staying home they're a good portion portion and weren't engaged and I think\nThey got to see the the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats had looked at ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart strategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours\nEntering states that that Donald Trump won\nWhat can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabin or that the Republicans pull him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay on because you only get Ninety million coming out in the mid term elections so they they made their heads the Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him\nAnd the Democrats were exposed\nThese voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to mirror good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother and said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man and his family and the Republicans are ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was a poll that we did for super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day\nIt's it's not a big explosion but what it is is Trump voters coming back in and get along well ... ... that Trump voters worked on what what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago a lot less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process the party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended\nClinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they are being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nWhile shot I mean I don't quite know how to fly but I'll give you ...\nYou can say I actually agree with your characterization and their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have is that I'm going to lead in the house which I just did it lead to pick up the house that I think from what I see looking at the Senate races there are all very very close within the margin her\nAnd I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after Kavanaugh is as I think we all expect\nNarrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job than you\nAre talking about Sean is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out ... I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats are from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York the the San Francisco and Los Angeles a or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with my writing of America I think it's going to play very differently\nI think the the real challenges the one John raises I think it starts right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs going to have it in such twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... and in sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did to this man Hans ... support for ... disgusting and I am buddy who lives for experimenting Arlen and things like that\nYou know what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they've been with no due process\nAnd for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled it properly they looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not\nYou probably have the Democrats handle this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you ... give me a chance to do that I Would add up I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal and philosophical differences\nWith the judge Kavanaugh so I Would not be voting for him but I Do think showing that you are correct\nThat the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and a Democrat second\nUm I think the process is destroying\nA the independence of our judiciary destroying the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but I'd like to think we stand for the same enduring values\nWasn't Lindsey Graham who in many ways showed such a profile in courage in this\nUm and even and I think the deliberate seriousness of Susan Collins\nYou know Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party John I mean you've got the extreme left and then you've got the super duper extreme left and\nThere's no room for a scoop Jackson they even through Joe Lieberman of all people out of the party how do you throw a Joe Lieberman out of your party [noise] um I mean that's insanity to me\nOh absolutely\nAnd and I tell you what does it does make the point you have over four weeks ago\nAnd that's a lifetime in politics I mean I mean remember twenty sixteen the Democrats put the late hit on Bush or not Bush part of it they did it to push for the drunk driving but they did it with to Donald Trump with a tape of that women are people people weren't right through it and realized it was a choice between Hillary Clinton\nAnd Donald Trump and they voted for Donald Trump and and this voters in the heartland right now that are engaged we have to keep them engaged over the next four weeks because what we win again and cabinet gets confirmed they can think oh things are fine now\nI think capital is going to be confirmed you will have the Republicans holding the Senate or narrowly and the Democrats winning the house but was thirty thirty five six [noise]\nWow that's a huge production for the Democrats um I don't think there's any scenario that I could discount thirty two days out of this election I think anything can happen and I hope the American people see what they were electing and Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters and Chuck Schumer that's my of my biggest hope John McLaughlin\n[noise] I think you're right and uh uh in terms of its just four weeks out over four weeks ago I can happen\nBut I Will tell you that the key thing is Donald Trump is putting the Republicans on his shoulders and bringing them across the finish line in that he's bringing his votes to bear but it is voters are coming back out but the key thing is\nJust too real opponents right now or Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer she needs to take them on they're going to be a nightmare if they get control either house\nOr a for next year so we've got to do is look left that she'll certainly had a fifty five percent unfavorable rating\nI mean fifty five percent will be a landslide for the Republicans and they could they could hold the house so right now we're headed to gain seats in the Senate but it's too early on the house and and prior to cabinet looked like we were going to lose the house but uh uh with that kind of a negative on policy\nFor her to be the leader to oppose Donald Trump every day to the elites where the swap runs the country got\nSo uh if he does that over the next four weeks the Republicans could hold the house and they'll definitely pick up Senate treats\nAlright thank you both John McLaughlin and dug shown eight hundred ... all one Sean toll free telephone number will continue we'll have our Florida Georgia Line background concert series when we get back and we'll continue all with Jesse lead Peterson referencing O'Brian it much more as this Friday edition of
