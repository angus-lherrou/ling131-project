{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "He was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and and he is a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just ... he travels around and I as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... 'cause if I go up to Salt Lake I use these ... from it rather than\nThe hall in mine around but it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just a state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and there are so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then\nThen great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place but if we want a little bit more for trying to cook it create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his\nFive fingers and I would have to name all of them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me I'm not going to be able to do this that\nConverted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to ... ... exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really taken truly a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life that drafter and

free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always liked to say and I said earlier on the shows doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\n... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have you have bags in bags loads of these these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad is people will get themselves stuck to think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right 'cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now\nAnd simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money and that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation\nAgain if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf and Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that\nI said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading because that's a whole another piece of it people go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you are you a training before after college she goes\nBefore of course it I Love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kind of fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great to after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half\nThe class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end where you say we do another giveaway yeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here ah right right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find a how and how is out at the half day class now just a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these

you're gonna love this pastor I Will say this pastor because you've been very good to me and you even said to me pray for me and I I I Am but I'm very touch when people say that to me and I know you mean you're a good guy and and David has written\nThe books he started with persecution his first book on faith and religion and um I think now the best book yet it's called Jesus has risen poll in the early church\nAnd David is that a pretty profound impact on me making me realize I'm not that religious and then I I Believe everything um I I Would be one of those people that sort of shows up at Christmas and Easter at your church\nUh and I don't go to church that much but uh but I Believe all of us ... and ah and both of you have encouraged me to to want to be better does that make sense\nIt makes a lot of sense or you know are often times phases contagious and phase one can rub off on another phase breed\nBasically you guys getting in my grilled Telhami Hannity you know you need to shape up their ship out [laughter] or Hannity going straight to hell live I can read your mind do I would never saw the way David ... book is now a two weeks in running on the New York times best seller list welcome to you too David said a pastor Scott and Kareem\nThank you hey how're you guys thanks for having me on\nWhat eight let's start with this mob everywhere we say we're not going to kick our ... I Would I ran into um\nWhat's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Kavanaugh hearings and he was a total jackass during those hearings it was coming out of where I was going in and I said center Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation\nIf he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out of the ... ballot box I\nHave a fear and when I say feel with him regarding myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go viral [laughter]\n\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself how would I had always said though man of the ... you know that's why I say I have a fair I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that all Amy the old me would come out and then I found if I'm with my wife told me would come out\nAnd then it will go by what my response would go viral but I think they pick and choose the targets does exactly well\nMaybe but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half maybe they aren't the largest and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to stop crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk away\nI Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or outright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like that's just not then they're going to get past and somebody's going to get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful\nAt it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think I mean we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left that just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and passed it what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor it in I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that there's a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated you know some people are going to vote the party regardless but others say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you\nSay they have it to another level and you're you're propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama said we're never coming back\nWhile the president get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus by night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just rent\nCream tell him his message was moving the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really good\nFor what we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but writing President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC just starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get in the ... the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this David if if we all\nBelieve in in ... the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes ... the word or education from the Latin isn't due to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people\nAnd that's what I see Trump's doing and it and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David\nLike dental and

Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting doesn't they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have obviously they want it to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it a to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win

friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nUh it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it and that this this whole thing about preexisting conditions

dollars keep your plan to keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right\nAnd now they're blaming us for messing it up um we tried to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put

remember we're gonna vote to repeal Obamacare and immediately repay replace it the original built that deal with preexisting conditions among other things\nThe Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew\nYou know what and talk to the president talked or leadership it said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies denying people with preexisting conditions that we we got

to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is well Republicans didn't support

the day we'll find out where the money comes from that supporting some of those uh I understand you know America can't continue to support and prop up as the president has been saying\nAll of these

Warren she's got to get a DNA test she's less of a Native American than you or me into the vapors Asian the caravan issue of the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his\nBase that cabin all thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they shake it okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process in the meat you know\nLet's take this guy that did very well credential judge\nOh he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter\nInsect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicting so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we're very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate\nAnd it couldn't happen without the energy and the ... President Trump\nWell if they do when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these fronts in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blamed the Democrats were not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mixed in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he cheese recognizing the legendary Friedman one\nAny country if you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your order because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that order to participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get a you know I'm I'm ... I'm promoting my my uh my vote today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response oh\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that have voted in laws I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... well could there answered by so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more job out of\nThe bottom ... percent of the society showing the wages about five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us all through the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get it on e call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President because of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background is similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not their jobs we now in two years\nHave a U.S a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better than your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look what you started I you know\nSean Sean with that I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so incredibly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspirations\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies because what we both know is that you cannot just ties or through a political system created equal outcome it never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tip top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders in her kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not want it here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor in distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here but\nThere's no moderation left either ... and the Democratic party ... used to I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or\nDisaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people which happened to me it's happened to me on college campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it but the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about this Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but about forty five to fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the Milwaukee\nYeah All right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs are and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs and eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps a dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nQuick break right back well continue more the mood Scaramucci on the other side she is the Senate candidate American War hero Martha mix Sally from Arizona will join us immigration obviously a big issue out there and we'll talk to her and much more straight ahead [noise]\nFred Trump showing up to collect rent with these twenty six year old son Donald Trump and and they're walking through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors Carolina family cannot pay the rent the father as lost the job he's a blue collar worker\nFred and his son are looking at him saying okay no problem\nAre very on guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job well and behold six short days later\nA he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed\nA and it's just a wonderful story about their family never\nGoing to be told by the mainstream media\nBut people talk about what does the president that compassion for these people does the president that after the the answer is yes he learnt that at the riding shotgun with his father is he was either building these buildings helping to fill these buildings are collecting rent for collar people that were living in a shot so\nSo I wanted I get a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of the Trump family which is a great American success [noise] many ways the added he family is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh put their goal part of America the ... of America\nYou know the the generations that built this country and I don't know if Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations of built these this country are just amazing people the immigrants that built this country my grandparents all for coming from Ireland\nUh anyway the book is called the

the\nTen years since I was in the spring and fall\nMy ... and I approve this message\nI we have a big race going on in the great state of Arizona Fifteen days from now glad you're with us twenty five to the top of the hour\nA that was an put out by Martha mix Sally a war hero and her background or experience is pretty unbelievable here also watching and Arizona this caravan are headed right towards our southern border it's become well a big big issue\nWe have a couple of things that have literally taking the people of Arizona back I'm\nKristin cinema once calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake yeah that blind shake involved in the what the bombings in America\nUm she's had no problem with Americans joining the Taliban\nMartha mix Sally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops of torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest development cinema once attacked BS stay at home moms for leech off their husbands\nThese women who lack like staying at home leech off their husbands or boyfriends and just cashing checks to some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life is fairly judgmental you would think\nMartha ... with us ah Martha how are you\nHey John I'm doing great thanks for having me on\nWell I think I'm happy with the last two polls one had you up by seven when I grew up by two ah but ah I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks about Christ in ... I Would imagine that you're opposed to going to go higher\nExxon well ... it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed and her mocking Arizona and extremism on so many issues as being on earth but the air\nAnd the local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are us turning it into a TV ad\nUh the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous so out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compared to nice to have been twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms and our way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly fighter jet in combat uh and then the first to command a fighter squadron and combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan\nA hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was an absolute honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear ... cinemas ill it's OK at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the Taliban and nearly died\nA son when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven\nUh the Taliban harbored al ... who can and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops to include you know truth well I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them and are eight ten but often times uh you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there is no this is silence there\nAnd everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nYou were building the funding and fully funding all yes and you had\nBoarded our belt thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall Yes sir\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell John I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on a house bill I'm getting my asking for it right now because of being misconstrued either Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear and people in that family\nMember wait a minute and I know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare as they held in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen if it really happy that there's no choice even lock their healthcare coverage we had people right now a tree that the conditions you can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I work hard to make sure that we were moving away from that uh and and towards something that gets more choice for people more flexibility at the state level more free market get the federal government you know to not be doing that one size fits all top down penalty taxes mandate\nIt out and so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ring that though I I voted to protect people with preexisting condition oh that's good intentions but their policy they're wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr Martha McSally a really a rock star a hero who served their country\nUnimportant race for the Republicans as they not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate\nIt'll make votes for Supreme Court justice was a lot easier on up against the very radical leftist and the name of Christian cinema thank you so much a Martha McSally for all you've done for your country and and the positions you take and ah you should win this race\nFar and wide when the people of Arizona fully understand the record the background and the radical views of Christ and send them a thank you for being with us Martha McSally\nThanks on appreciate you signing a flashlight on that and an advocacy and if people want to how they can go to Nick Sally for Senate dot com you need your support and help and donations to weaken my nesting thanks so much\nThank you rod as in Florida crushed view on the Sean Hannity show her Iraq\nYesterday legislation on the show dedicated listener concerns my concern is the Supreme Court list that the president at actually a presented when he was Ron Paul is okay\nAnd the reason why my concern is is is because magic close is already a put the news out there that they do smear campaigns\nAnd they've done it can initially they want us to have transparency and so we've given transparent like open up our playbook so they can actually investigate every person on that list so whoever president shop actually nominates they've already got a team investigate and that's specific personally attacked a smear campaign\nWell that's all you get from the Democrats that their only play book that's all they have that one on one one or two one oh three one oh five one oh nine that this is it you know and you know it's interesting to watch the Democrats now are trying to urge caution on blue wave and temper expectations they're scared to death\nBecause after all the mobs and after what they did with Kavanaugh and what we see what the caravan and we see the now the that it is getting into focus what eight years of Obama was like versus two years of Trump\nThe American people you know watching two years of smearing and landers and misinformation the American people see

you know\nThe amazing this is now number three reticent a phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill\nThe pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are\nYou a showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the sameness Heidi Heitkamp director in her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in the battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of Brett is an even calling the people tendency ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this other guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those a bomb it looks like the ... on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well\nBecause the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff the same so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead after what was the moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be settled liberate once you get selected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again\nSo because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they were lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicions that well that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really a left or right thing I was at this first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were you know
