schools\nSo that a child that brings an aspirin to school is considered um as as big of a problem as someone who brings enlisted drugs a\nMarijuana or whatever it might be cocaine\nBut they're all drugs even though it's aspirin\nEveryone gets expelled so that kind of concept of all or nothing that is it really points to laziness than it does anything else\nAnd if you're going to be lazy\nIn your face and not use discernment then why did got put you here and give you the tools like scripture and prayer and a shake things like there is wisdom in a multitude of counsel so the people around you to get insight if you're just supposed to go okay not doing this ever\nOr they're not doing this every type things sure there are but even the ten commandments are you talking about ...

me he prayed for me and I I I Am I'm very touch when people say that to me and I know you mean you're a good guy and and David has written these books she started with persecution his first book on faith and religion and\nUm I think now the best book yet it's called Jesus has risen pole and the early church and David is that a pretty profound impact on me making me realize I'm not that religious and then I I Believe everything um I I Would be one of those people that sort of shows up at Christmas and Easter at your church\nUh and I don't go to church that much but um but I Believe all of us and uh and both of you have encouraged me to to want to be better does that make sense\nIt makes a lot of sense to you know are often times phase is contagious and faith one can rub off one another phase breed\nBasically you guys getting my grilled Telhami Hannity you know you need to shape up their ship out [laughter] or Hannity going straight to hell I I can read your mind knew I wouldn't have a subtle way David's\nBook is now a two weeks and running on the New York times best seller list welcome to you too David said a pastor Scott and green\nThank you hey how are you guys thanks for having me on what ... what start with this mob everywhere we see we're not going to kick our ... I Would I ran into\nUm what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington with during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings it was coming out of where I was going in and I said center Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation\nIf he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with um I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out of the ... ballot box I\nHave a fear and when I say feel with him regarding myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response would go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I'm asked myself what I had to wait another man of the ... that's why we have a fear I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the old me will come out and then if I'm with my wife told me would come out and then it will go by what my response would go by what but I think they pick and choose their targets does exactly\nWell maybe but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half maybe the martial arts and they know this well it ... it is not going to stop crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk like\nI Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or outright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but\nMost people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past not then they're going to get past and somebody's going to get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to\nBe civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interaction but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nI look I don't know why are we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics\nWith with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but\nKavanaugh the mobs the caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for a better job they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others the say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I ... so do you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump that the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus by night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just recording tell him as a message to live in the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really good\nFor would do it with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN the politics of CNN and MSNBC just starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the ... the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all\nBelieve in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes ... the word or\nEducation from the Latin isn't due to bring forth from within\nThat tells you the God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years at Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get back what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why\nHave an alien Abul lights it flows from that but I think the leftist authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked\nI don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort to identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics dividing people on the basis of race and gender\nIs every four to them for years the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white or read that book is a racist sexist massage in this Tacoma ... Lama foe but they weren't dirty air water they want to kill children and grandma throw over the cliff\nBut also they also hold eyes kept him out yeah and then one of the polar ice cap to melt Sean\nWell there's so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around a Trump expand that opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black\nAnd I'm telling you liberals can't stand is a ... and the other people who were defecting from their plantation can't stand it this is exciting stuff it's uplifting we need to go on a positive message nationalize that these last week\nI how great would it be weaker transform cities like Detroit Cleveland elsewhere where every person that lives in this country\nHas a nice beautiful house in a safe neighborhood a nice car truck that they could afford a vacations take the kids to do is anyone there seven and be miserable but but they want to take their kids go out to eat and not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things that if this is universal listed humanity\nYes it is I really believe you mix fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging as long as I mentioned in stays consistent also I think that you know there's a script in the Bible says this is no weapon formed against the self prosper\nI Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation I'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that a lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans regardless of political party this year at the same concerns that the Republican Party\nShares right good to see a both curry and we've got to let you go to thank you so much for being with us pastor always go to see it when you were in New York my present you being here David as always congrats another New York times best seller it's on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com\nUh when we come back a tight race for congressman Ted but we'll check in with him than your calls eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number of an awesome Hannity tonight at nine hope you'll join us as we continue and you're listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show we'll have more of your favorite gas topics and memorable moments that's all coming up\n[noise]\nThis is Michael ... than here with my style from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down\nThe government protect the costs of Medicare plants will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best right help markets opera's a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and say\nWhat is that people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go it alone get unbiased helped to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with lower copayments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away\nIt's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistance is free\nThanks my this is Michael met that for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance Colleen outrage seven one three forty forty two that's eight hundred seven one three forty forty to eight hundred seven one three forty touched on the U.S department of health and human ...\nFox News I'm like the opposite of Texas elections director issues the warning to early voters\nWhat he said look out for is pressing to enter button and moving the dial at the same time I wanted to see for myself what the issue was using a sample sure enough it happened democratic democratic Republican turning wheel [noise]\nAnd pressing inner at the same time but if I use one hand and took a bit more time moving to the next page now it says all the same party\nK.

twenty five percentage points but now because of uh Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision\nThey decided read do you draw that state's congressional map as a district that has a chance of flipping and as

out there\nWe ... call they wanted to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it or to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you kind of highlighted some of the things are doing of course the big thing they're doing which they're not just doing it to me you know and talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Matt gates whoever\nOr it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it and that's this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare a showing you know they're the ones that screwed up our healthcare system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a\nTwenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan to keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right\nAnd now they're blaming us for messing it up um we tried to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put what thumbs down but\nYou know Sean when we fought the original the Freedom Caucus in particular fought that original a bill out of a you know the ... the

things\nThe Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew\nYou know what and talk to the president talked to her leadership and said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies denying people with preexisting conditions that we we got that right in the buildup we finally passed yet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that we broke healthcare\nWell let's all hardly ... tried to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the

says there or not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people they legally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats were not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary built for even one set of any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your border because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so I don't get a you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows where they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response oh\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that have voted in laws I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... well could there answered by so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more jobs\nOut of the bottom ... percent of the society showing the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving the lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us all through the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get Donny call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and they said ... done if you don't mind going to hijack the nicknames and just switch out billionaire and put in President because of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background is similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in our country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not their jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look what you started I you know\nShowing showing listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so incredibly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration in America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that\nCan do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that are parents that for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies on because what we both know is that you cannot system ties or through a political system created equal outcome it never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders entered kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she does all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not want it here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after in uh Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor in distinction\nIs that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left\nEither ... and the Democratic party ... used to I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nOn equal outcome so you know bad society or even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they make contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people which happened to me it's happened to me on college campuses\nIt's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it or you don't know what's great about the people just want you to think about this Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the ...\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the

supported the wall and this is the worst group or whatever like on the ground saying\nOkay because I just add something or yeah or like making people go she doesn't support the wall and the other day I don't know but ah so I don't say that she doesn't want them to kind of\nPeople don't really understand why\nHe like they're going to look at me while I\nWas right on the wall or was he didn't even

amazing this is now number three reticent a phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are\nYou [laughter] hey showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the sameness Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states elected\nWhich so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people tendency ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's use and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this other guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those a bottle looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well\nBecause the presses here and and we take it down and when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states they have to mislead they have to what was the moderate voters and play the progressive base\nWell we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be settled liberate once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again\nSo because this what Jesse Overton says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they're ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that well that's what we do it very possibly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really a left or right thing I was at this First Amendment conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and\nNearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to woo the moderates and they and they can only make one choice\nOne for this you know we have a choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state\nPenn well Dave though it's so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talked to anybody in his\nStaff but McCaskill asked should be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about so many people\nKnow I Know and it it it it ... to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone\nTelling you not to go on the radio in talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're east Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something else Sean if\nIt's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks then how wrong is that for them to mislead the voters if it's it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way\nFrom like on my county board of elections like five or seven

about these states we've already have them are getting a little bit more we still undercover\nPeople in play is the ... in it and they're supposed to represent their states their constituencies but

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders shocking moments ago about the Pittsburgh synagogue massacres atrocity was a chilling active mass murder it was an act of hatred\nYou know wealth gun issues I listen to me we've had too many shootings at schools at churches in this particular case this is the largest anti Semitic shooting in history of the United states\nAnd you know when the president says that you know having armed guards at school or I've been advocating for a long time now retired police retired military on the perimeter in the property on every in every hall of every school\nAnd that's one way to protect our children and I always ask a simple question and it's not to me about the gun debate if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter would you prefer that there are ... you know that there are trained professionals\nIn that building with firearms as a first line of defense especially knowing that most of these shootings or over in seconds\nAnd even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments it's usually by the time they get there it's ... it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect in in an orderly fashion those who either or injured or weren't injured\nSo it's a thought um it's been used before but that's not a big story of the day the saddest thing I watched all we got to watch very closely\nAnd even hearing my name brought up a number of times and you know I'm just shaking my head because people obviously know nothing about me\nThey do nothing about you know they don't take the time the either bother to watch or listen to this program if you've been listening to this program\nYou know we have been decrying going back to Kavanaugh the angry mobs\nIn Washington confronting bidding at senators not letting them closed doors there\nWe've been talking about how dangerous the left wing mob mentality is cotton we've talked about the incidences of Sarah Sanders in her family or kids trying to get something to eat secretary Nielsen trying to get something to eat\nYou know we've talked about Pam Bondi trying to go see a movie Mitch McConnell walking to an airplane numerous times and Mitch McConnell have in his his table slammed on food ripped off his table just last weekend Kevin McCarthy's office having a Boulder sent through it\nYou know and I've been saying it it's

these cabinet members you get a crowd or does she thinks is going to happen when the crowd is formed and you follow them into restaurants and department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted any anywhere anymore\n... how is that going to end well\nTold the story when I met senator what's that guy's name from Connecticut again ... looming fall when I was coming out there who was in the middle of the capital hearings you know I don't I don't understand being rude to somebody just because you have a political disagreement\nWe had a very pleasant conversation I invited him on my show I don't know what came of it but nothing obviously but I don't know where he's thinking about it what is the point of being rude to people are getting in people's faces says Cory Booker Spartacus says why is there this anger out there\nThat we have you know all these bombs that are sent out\nThe first one went to George Soros and I said that day I said this this has got to stop\nAnd George Soros is no fan of Sean Hannity's funds groups that wants me to be silenced and go away but that's not what we do in this country we protect people you're allowed to have political views and spend your money the way you you see fit in life\nAnd even if it's being spent to silence made you know what I still believe in free to\nOr the ... you know I don't want to see any politician hurt and I have consistent consistently over the years said that\nWhen President Obama and people you know threatening him and people race how do we let how does somebody get into the White House says that happened we've got to protect our elected officials we have one president at a time we got it that represents the United states and that represents all of us\nAnd at the end of the day the powers in the ballot box\nBut you know you watch something like what happened this weekend and you watch\nThe Democratic party their lap dogs in the media wasted no time\nYou know trying to politicize this terrible shooting over the weekend pin blame the massacre on President Trump look if the president says fake news is not serving the people of this country you can chronicle it\nYou can watch it they don't see it which is sad their views and their bias and they're abusive a platform\nBut the reality is they live and they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape or form of calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter this guy Rodney Bowers by the way he hated President Trump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated the fact\nThat President Trump and I think he could make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has aligned with Israel more than any other president in modern times you know Trump surrounded by a slur for Jewish people and then that heat the this killer lamenting there's there's no maggot as long as there's a\nYou know bad word of a quote in ... infestation but despite those facts you have people\nYou know pretty close to blaming the president and conservatives for the shooting Joe Biden widely expected to run for the presidency seemed to do so when he tweeted to the president's words matter silences complicity what does he talking about Paul Krugman New York times suggesting that Trump was to blame at least in part\nSpeaking sarcastically Krugman tweeting all linked to the story with the caption but no but\nNone of the white supremacist terrorism as anything to do a Trump\nOh no it's unbelievable how they now have you know believe their own lives Alan Dershowitz had a powerful column and the Daily Caller today and he's been a a\nDefender over the years a staunch defender and rightly so of Israel\nAnd Jewish civil rights anyway drew linked this morning and pointed out something the very few are willing to say and he said a day after a man killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue he criticized presidents Obama and Clinton as well as Keith Ellison this is Alan Dershowitz\nAnd then went on Fox and friends this morning there can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism we have to have zero tolerance President Obama meets with Eric ... they hit the picture for eight years\nShame on him but now we have the picture President Clinton sits on the same platform with Farrakhan shame on him\nHe tell us and joins with Farrakhan for ... one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic hate just because he's black doesn't give him a pass on anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with Farrakhan as part of the problem not the solution\nThe Pittsburgh massacre comes just two weeks after ... you know called Jewish Americans termites and that's mild compared to the\nThe anti Semitism anti Semitism in the past and is that racism as well\nYou know there's there's rarely bashing Trump Peter Linder SARS sore after the ... massacre in Pittsburgh we're hearing where new calls to have a national conversation\nWell as long as we don't overlooked some of the obvious suspect\nYou know if you look at some of the the the history now with the Democratic party that don't seem to be the supporters of Israel they once were and it's not limited just the Farrakhan you know you have Palestinian activists Linder source or well known that\nYou know she was a a lead organizer of the anti Trump woman's march where McDonald's said she'd dreamed an awful lot about blowing up the White House what's not so well known as the association that many prominent elected Democrats have what's our store\nYou know in in just the last year she's been campaigning alongside some of the Democratic party's most celebrated rising star alec Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez no wonder Cortez adopted many of our shores well radical positions and it was Kirsten Gillibrand's herself introduced at a rally biased source or and last week had Lou reiterated his support for Linda is our store\nAnd she's been campaigning for Michigan house a candidate\nRashida totally move vows to vote to slash aid to Israel when she gets in Congress in August Bernie Sanders was campaigning weather and we're beginning to see something here is democratic candidates increasingly\nYou know they're they're being team was the most radical types of it if it was if it was Trump I can assure you there'd be a lot of people speaking out All right we have a lot more to talk about we'll talk about how you know Fox is under fire I'm under fire house never Trump or is it just so bitter and angry\nThere's all kinds of data points out there on one indicator is

played such a powerful force in American politics in many ways he has rebuilt the Christian Coalition in terms of\nGetting out mailers and and making contacts with voters all around the country key races\nNow in the Senate will watch in Florida it's a dead heat and that's both the Senate with Rick Scott and that's for governor and Ron dissenters has a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle and people showing up in the panhandle\nYou got a very tight race for governor and the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back towards camp and back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett is it and we have British ... team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin on that he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really has taken people back also on tape staffers progressing calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall holds but people have got to get up to vote 'em we see Josh Hawley is doing very well and he's up by a couple of percentage points in Missouri against that phony Claire McCaskill\nAnd she's bragging about how she really politically it's just like Obama but she too like bread as soon as hiding who she really is\nHeidi Heitkamp in North

factor\nThere that I really see is there's a libertarian that's drawing votes so away from the Republican so if you're in Indiana do vote libertarian or else that's like a half a vote for Donnelly we've got to hold the seat\nHeld her seat in Nevada right now he's currently up in the polls but it's always tightened Nevada and then Arizona I have no idea why poll came out this weekend showing

is with us\nThat's the Senate do you agree with my assessment\nI'd Ishaan we're uh we're currently are contacting twenty six million evangelical and pro life and pro family Catholic voters and Nineteen states we knocked on a million nine hundred seven thousand three hundred and twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not that we're counting and\nAs of this weekend five point eight million of the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day\nWe think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had a turtle election well\nI Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I look at ras muses number of the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide here\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats at two o five Republicans a two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and Sean ... are it by the people right now certainly have a ... thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature for our organization is ignore the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the ...\nAnd everybody tells me you know I make a living for people not ignoring\nYour except it okay by it but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election

you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because ... shows you what other people are paying for the Patriot\nAm eleven fifty\n\nBreathe founder chairman of the faith and Freedom Coalition\nUm and I think that the ... look there are many factors I think Kavanaugh is playing a part in this I think the Democrats ... none of them have spoken at all about the caravan their silence has been definite you know and then they'll say is well Republicans talking about it means that they're they're racist and Xena phobic it no it just means we believe in the rule of law\nAnd we're not going to wait the four weeks so\nYou know seven fourteen thousand people make it here\nSo I think that's playing a part I think all the incidence of the mob on the Democratic party side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up\nA Republican headquarters in Florida we saw the terrible shooting in the Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican congressman you have an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans\nPunched in Minnesota or there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left you see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nAre paid run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy's office it with a Boulder busting his office window so there's a lot of left wing violence out there and it's a pretty dangerous time\nYeah and I think a anytime you're dealing with a different kind of pervasive dark the most important thing that you can do is light a candle and I think what people have got to do is they've got to resist that hate with a look for their country a love for their fellow man\nAnd hope for a better future for all of our citizens stay positive stay prayer full and work hard you know I when I was coming up shot and me in the eighties I had a friend of mine who was running for Congress had a sign on the campaign headquarters I never forgot\nIt said work like it all depends on you and pray like it all depends on God that's not a bad way to live then it's not a bad way to live now\nAnd I really well said Ralph Reed he is with the faith and Freedom Coalition and by the way people want to get in touch and help you out how to do

citizenship\nAlright no news roundup information overload our eight hundred number one show and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen and we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico um but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them and who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership in Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries\nAre from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam ... senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your\nCountry thank you for having me no pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column midnight I haven't read the whole Columbia but what if my read a bit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question what on the Mark I'm there\nActually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this or folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president's ... who basically tried to overthrow the constitution and making self presidents for life they are in bed with the Venezuelan\nAnd they'll have laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that role in organizing a posting videos and pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and that is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad and our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president\nTalked about a border wall with a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity but not anything to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws and according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply ... to walk across the border I have always wondered by the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border\nWhy is it that only people who can walk here should be allowed to get him just out of stuff if that's the principal\nWell what I'm I'm married and lives I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he said and if people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border the military is going to be\nGiven the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here are coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess but nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\n... ugly down at the sun shine we don't want anybody hurt and also it is undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff on the ... probably been lied to the game I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nSo they are being caught in the in the middle of this I'm simply used as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I've I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall of an end fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty\nI saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding will look like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or ... million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument is just what we have to do for our own safety\nThat will without question of what you've just described is most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who control the border that we are supposed to allow three to four billion people move here\nBecause that is what you were actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion and we obviously cannot do that we have to maintain control of\nYou know All right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program we got to take a break up right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections or turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings your tax savings that's on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages your four O. one K. is that is also on the ballot\nAnd if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future politicians bureaucrats the socialist in DC or you you want to preserve the victories of the past two years\nOld get involved this election this November and go to big choice election dot com big choice election dot com they're going to make it simple for you to do your part now you can mail make calls and emails tax\nKnock on doors help neighbors get to the polls go to big choice election dot com because the only way we lose this year is if you don't show up if you don't turn out go to big choice election dot com do your part\nAnd let's not get out worked in November big choice election dot com will come back for your phone call straight ahead eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number\n... you know Hillary and all that and that's really getting sicker and ... by the name Trump so I think they just they just want to silence and they're going to just vote Republican\nLeaning I I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats Bush if the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada\nI think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana\nAnd we'll win North Dakota Florida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head of that today and I'm ... I'm trying to warn people that this was real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house\nAnd that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house or it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nVery Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go vote for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirement\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all into get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses\nBecause Nancy Pelosi as speaker\nAnd Maxine Waters is a committee chairwoman and Adam Schiff as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman\nIt just it's a disaster for us eight hundred nine four one Sean are toll free telephone number [noise]\n\n[noise] nothing is sacred to these people their minds have been poisoned by this loop\nOf MSNBC and all the rest of\nCNN the Washington Post New York times their minds have been poison they think that they're smart when they talk about how the president has to be removed by the twenty Fifth Amendment they think they're savvy when they discuss the coming fascism in this country they're hysterical in muscle [noise] but they're also getting danger and they are really destroying some of what holds us all together in\nThis box active like this on the patriots am eleven fifty\nYears I'm rich Dennison White House press secretary Sarah Sanders rejecting concerns that President Trump's rhetoric could inspire some of the domestic terrorists acts seen in recent days\nIs outrageous that anybody other than the individual who carried out the crown withhold that responsibility\nThe suspect from the deadly Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and the manager used up sending pipe bombs to critics and opponents of the president both making course appearances today the Trump Administration order a more than five thousand troops to support homeland security operations at the U.S Mexico border they\nAre not supposed to be coming into contact with migrants and with protests are they are not there and law enforcement capacity their engineers say our medical personnel and they're providing air left for customs and border patrol agents\nFox's Catherine heritage is eight hundred troops arrived at the border earlier today another eight hundred expected to arrive\nTomorrow the Fox news [noise]\nWithout traffic on the Patriot am eleven\nAnd he's still a sixty freeway east bound before many boulevard an accident number one and two lanes block to slip says the freeway traffic is almost at a standstill from the five freeway interchange action against sixty he's found before ...

you're with us twenty five now till the top of the hour uh\nAre about thirty races now we have identified actually if you look at real clear politics they have they have narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point this actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey ... they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words it we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when that you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think we'll have pick ups\nI think will hold Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians cinema can be beaten as well how she was up at three in the latest polls beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exactly even tie forty six all Nelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida round the census was coming back interesting John James and Michigan is cut his latest stabbing now in half\nAnd it's only a six point race in Michigan where it was once twenty and so he's doing very well a lot of eyes are paying attention to the latest poll in West Virginia where mentioned is down by two\nIn New Jersey Menendez is only up by three and seeing is very weak and could be the big surprise of the night\nBoth West Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprise is not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medal is currently serves as the chairman of the board of commissioners for Lehigh County Pennsylvania you're running for\nCongress there in the Pennsylvania seventh district to fill Charlie dense empty seat and a big Trump supporter but it it's a tight race where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nAnd I'll say that Sean first of all thank you for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every corner of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue is to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all and make it sound wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back beyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got reticent in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we got Heidi Heitkamp\nWill unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they planned to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing and the case of Tennessee got reticence that calling the people in Tennessee ignorant so is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day that Democrats think everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can see pass or angry is Sean and let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixty and when the media had two scenarios out there\nOne of the best the best case of Hitler and wanting the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors of come out contrast after two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten can midterm stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change\nGive the crumbs back increase it regularly watch jobs go back overseas see now that's that's the difference my opponent goes and talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some some people in November six", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "29"}
