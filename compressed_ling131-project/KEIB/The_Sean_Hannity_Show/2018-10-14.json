so good ... team was just the doctor order for UCLA as they put a thirty seven on the cow golden\nBears during Thompson Robinson Thirteen to Fifteen for a hundred and forty one yard ... about Joshua Kelly though the junior running back\nGiven the ball given the Baltimore and then keep giving them to even when he doesn't want it thirty carries a hundred and fifty seven yards and three touchdowns he had his longest is Eighteen yard to run on the ... five catches for Ninety two yards deal Howard had to catch is for twenty three yards\nAs UCLA puts it together they forced five turnovers and this one a theory is picking had nine tackles key Sean loose year south how 'bout that night he had\nSix tackles three and a half tackle for last a sack an interception and scooping score for a touchdown I think that's the trifecta isn't it [noise] a sack\nAn interception in a scoop and score I'm pretty sure that just about as good as it gets\nIf you're a defensive player Chris Barnes eight tackles two and a half tackled for loss and an interception as well everything went right for UCLA if you didn't know any better and maybe you were just I don't know gone or out of watching baseball or just not paying attention to college football for the first six weeks of the season\n[noise] and just turned on the practical network which maybe most or you don't get any ways but uh maybe you stumbled across UCLA game\nThis this afternoon and you wow UCLA ... thirty seven to seven wow UCLA is really efficient offensively while UCLA is really taking it the cow and putting pressure on brand new ... game well yeah that's a not so good Cal team and this is a UCLA team improving\nSlowly but surely tonight and they got to put it all together and again it's a ... team that's not very good\nIt's accounting that's down and when I was still in conference play but nonetheless it's a road waiting for UCLA which they haven't had many of these to come for the last couple of years especially impact will play an for UCLA it's the first one of the season in for a lot of these young guys\nA lot of these red shirt and true freshmen sophomores or getting first time playing ... defense\nThis is a win that they desperately wanted this is something they've been craving for and trying to get for the last six weeks they've been working for hard and not given up on and UCLA football to their credit these guys these coaches the really stuck with it the last five weeks just by being on five\nGet a win tonight and they really show that hey they've improved\nAnd they're continuing to get better and hopefully UCLA can build upon this\nAnd we talked about last week after the last of Washington maybe this is baby steps for UCLA now and moving forward and next week another opportunity to win again\nAnd make it to wins in a row for UCLA how 'bout that you went three that's called the winning streak eight six six Ninety seven to five Seventy or actually run on a unload fifty so it's a seven ... seven ... seven fifty eight seven seven\nFive to oh loving fifty to post Gabe ruined talk you're on the eleven fifty eight seven seven five to oh loving fifty UCLA gifts to win a thirty point win over Cal thirty seven to seven Dorian Thompson Robinson did a lot today and did a lot but I Do too much Thirteen or Fifteen for a hundred and forty one yard efficient\nVery efficient\nAnd dry and joins I'm Robin ... for twenty seven yards including a twenty yard run to get them down inside the one yard line on a drive in fact this could've been worse scoring game for UCLA they could have won by more\nIf not having to settle for a couple of fuel goals deep and Cal territory UCLA had opportunities to get seven instead walked away with three\nAnd again is thirty point when it's nice I went over a cow is really nice uh packed wall road wind is impressive\nAnd something to build on but this this at UCLA thing that really could afford it on the cow goat embarrassed and I as it is Thirteen and Fifteen for a hundred and forty one yards he actually had a little ball bounces way at this point the season how refreshing to see the ball actually bounce UCLA way for once\nAnd it was a player which he threw it\nAnd it deflected off Michael ... hands the freshman wide receiver and ...\nAnd went right into the hands of Kayla Wilson that actually set up the first touchdown of the game by Joshua Kelly but how about that little little lock a little deflected ball\nBounces the right way for UCLA from a Z keys hands right into Caleb Wilson's hand inside the red zone UCLA there was set up the first touchdown for Joshua Kelly the junior running back and again during Thompson Robinson you heard him on the post game show maybe you didn't saying that he's heard it he's heard the critics he's heard some of the college football\nAnalyst out there and say hey you got to start using your legs a little bit more your athletic quarterback you can do damage you could be a threat in a different way if the pocket breaks down you are a threat to run the ball that can open up the offensive team start to kind of Keenan on you throw into much\nNow that you can run in and make that an extra thread that now for the defense a little bit back on their heels a little bit more and can't just zero in on one\nAspect of the game that stopping the run and stopping your past a now they've got to worry about during Tom Robinson tonight he was able to get it don't his legs and that's going to open things up for UCLA as they move forward eight Seventy seven five to eleven fifty eight seven seven\nFive to

he was as excited as chip Kelly is going to get\nWe know he doesn't get too excited but uh it was nice to see him showing some sort of excitement and he did so tonight after the game with Wayne Cook\nIn his post game interview so it's good to see him excited or more excited about these guys getting their first Wendy's freshmen\nGetting their first when these young guys getting playing time

the lead up to the mid term elections I think the Kavanaugh hearings has awoken people to just how vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past\nWith the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox show you a racist besides you this you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics can easily Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back then we're going to back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a\nWe may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy that Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks um and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America\nThat this was a process

really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation a ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of issues unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnish stay just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning\nTimes

and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize what five ... five ... actually a warrant just like a search warrant\nIn order to get a ... a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information the affidavit is true incorrect to the best of his knowledge and beliefs\nAnd that's the way we operate and if this wrong sometimes it is if you find out as an incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in there with that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know it was signed up as David they gotta Pfizer warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal buys the application and the case of Carter Page a which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the phone eight Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course\nHe's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller and uh now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled appearance before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the
