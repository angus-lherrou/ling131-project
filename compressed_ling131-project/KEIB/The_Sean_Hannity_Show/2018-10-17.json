I think she may think she's on the wall and they don't ask don't let them think that\nAnd if they don't ask let them think that that's what the rule is now for the Democratic party even the center for American Progress sending out don't talk about immigration Maxine Waters admitting that she's being told don't talk about impeachment just shut shut up about it we we know we know we're going to do but we're not going to\nWe're not going to help people the truth before an election that's Claire McCaskill and and people on her staff people just can't know that she wants a semi automatic rifle ban and that\nThat of course she would vote yes on gun bans of course she supports the semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on guns because she has a bunch of Republican voters but secretly shoes that she supports say hey gun control group you know in our staff is saying well wait till after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now\nWith you know three weeks Twenty one days collection they why would we ever tell people the truth people just can't know McCaskill\nAnd Obama essentially the same views on everything wow now the people in Missouri I Hope you're paying close attention but it's bigger than that a project Vera tosses got this undercover video they got the undercover video the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen Marsha Blackburn is now up by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line he'll he'll do the right thing when he gets there of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what ... what we're saying we vote for cabinet of course he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh\nI mean this is all part of a light campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power\nAnd it's being exposed to very high level I mean this is really you know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people in Tennessee in Missouri a James O'Keefe is with us She's the founder of project Vera toss\nExposing the senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars that's all I think when I see those great job\nYeah Sean this is a pattern you know we really the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate rather than you know responded by bumbling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all of a staffer Sean inside Claire McCaskill's office they're all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards some of that already it was a little hard to hear but\nOne of those powerful pieces which when the sky Glenn Winfrey one of McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates after we did the impeachment because we're going to have to mislead them\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it and that's the that's the ... it's the next arose field organizer tells us\nHe says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on Obama have the same views I confronted neck on the street yesterday with a microphone Nick why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee is true in North Dakota\nOh how nice red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected if it's a necessary condition so all we're doing is exposing\nYou don't want you know what you're going to say just agree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win\nAnd ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty and embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you

I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive the nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nYeah they try to see things just harder to God\nAnd I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most hating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them is the United States Senate or\nHave been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage you mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri their their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journals do not want to talk about this in fact I just got a bike up Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about some of these position what about other things she came here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much have we gone for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now what's supposed is something that I've been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and Everytime they told me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office don't talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is a really scary scenario for the call\nFree and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is to lie and to hide who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now on the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in Missouri and want the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us to take the money ... indirect means\nIn order to I guess appeal to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats were shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when\nThe Democratic party a band in any sense of due process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute capital was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so-called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you got these ads are his middle class of managers attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punch by an anarchist after trying to stop him from kicking her campaign side\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was the stuff that sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I Know you play loaded on your show last night and she said the number that quoted she says well start off with Josh Hawley that to her opponent would be part of fraudulent embedding someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he did not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she is one on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud\nLet me ask you have to involve the Nevada are you involved in Montana you involved in North Dakota and Indiana are you involved in Florida are you involved in\nThe states you just mentioned except one wow we we got a lot coming shot at and we in fairness to the stories I Want to get the local media is covering

a twenty fourteen study scientific study and they said that average European American walking around his point one eight percent\nNative American she's half of that\nSo the idea that she continues to double down on this why is the most disgusting thing to me is the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it is backfiring on her and I I'm Glad to see it because she what she means that do come out and apologize to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president for not running for president I Am not running for president at the United states are you going to find that at no I'm not running and I'm not going to run\n\nI'm Geoff Diehl running to be your fulltime US Senator you don't need a part-time author part time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm Jeff deal the guy who stopped automatic gas tax hikes and now I'm not just not partisan gridlock in Washington that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren St Elizabeth Warren ... officers race from front to back\nMe I call them heroes men and women\nThe line every day\nMy campaign isn't about party politics about getting the job done Massachusetts I'm Jay Field I approve this\nMessage or that is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now till the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ... ads by Jeff deal was born well she does have to get re elected a senator if she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is Native American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she lifted herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a perfect\nSir at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school she was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out he is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this they and tries to prove\nTo her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics at the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts land solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but you really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill well than\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nToday showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm and you know Scott Brown won when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the un Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the bus into traumas association has never endorsed a Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist friends at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "17"}
