about\nMuslims accounts Fox has gone on Scott has this live\nFrom Lisa us attorney Scott Brady said Monday his office had up to a month to present a case to a federal grand jury well that result came much faster as shooter Robert Bowers was indicted today on forty four total counts which include federal hate crimes\nThe shooter hates Trump in large part because he's such a staunch supporter of Israel and yet that doesn't stop them\nFrom collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and rhetoric blaming Trump\nWere the Pentagon shooting but yet the guy involved in the shooting hate the president in large part because he is so closely aligned with our closest ally Israel\n... in this country is white man most have been radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about\nIf you got to stop the main things about me I'll stop and citing angry lunatics to kill you you know whether the\nPresident knew what he was saying the alleged gunman certainly heard

as being ... by the president of the United states where the races\nFor any time I think that he's probably powered of racial ...\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump\nHated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve's beliefs on the ball field in and shut up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders\nBernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not isn't it's actually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rational they would ever give it if it's a conservative\nJust the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it it is in is what it is the biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media\nIs universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs\nYou know the whole lie about Russian collusion it's just what I've been saying they don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for word dynasty a full of Russian lies\nUsed to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty sixteen it was it was used to get fired warrants on verified uncorroborated Russian lies that even the own\nEven the author of the\nOf the ... even stand by let me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be maybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east ones overall because of\nThe threat of a rainy in Germany in the region now caused an alliance that was unthinkable maybe just a number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into what I think is just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media\nThey don't even see what blind hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up their rhetoric that they faint moral outrage about but they are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card I he said I'm a nationalist David Duke comes out the next day say thank you thank you so much for\nFinally admitting that your own life nationalist and then you have a even some Republican back ventures are that\nAre are linking George Soros and these anti Semitic threats to the caravan Fox News talking about\nSmall pox and leprosy coming up it

even know what to say anymore you know Don Lemon last night or the night before whenever I think it was last night listen to what he says\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and not realizing biggest terrorist\nThreat in this country is white men most of it I'm radicalized brought up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them [noise] there was no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy banned [noise] so what do we do about that\nI I just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning host adjusting the Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the fact that\nSo he seems to be hearing in on the two pillars of the media continuing hit the trail and attacks against me and my current continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to say using some of the same language that the mass murder\nAt the synagogue used in terms and invaders and\nInvasion these tragedies working at cross purposes narrative so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of vilified hang migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nAnd I don't I don't even know where to go with this you know joined list may heart not even on her show the view but on conspiracy TV MSNBC you've also a time has gone along with them as as\nCars out on their own all even just like oh I I've I like the guy in a way it was like oh here in New York character he's not a Republican or Democrat he's just an advocate decides on [noise]\nAnd I don't mean that an ad hominem [laughter]\nNah not at all let me tell you what it means they are afraid they ... a ... look there are three scenarios as I said for election night\nWill be examining the results one week from today on this radio program and there is an unknown factor here anyone that tells you they know what's gonna happen doesn't\nThere is there's not one outcome to be very Frank with you that would surprise me one week from today when we gather here to talk about the results but I Do know this\nI Do the fear at a level that is unprecedented they never saw Trump coming they never understood that\nThe election day twenty sixteen they were in a state of\nShock and it was not only shock it was obvious sadness depression you know CNN white flash it don't against the country et cetera\nYeah that that's not it is they end up back at their head really fear you know\nThe American people and what you're gonna decide\nEvery race matters is four hundred and thirty five house races you vote for any Democrat or you stay home\nYou're voting for ... as the next speaker all these important Senate races Florida Tennessee Texas Ted Cruz a Claire McCaskill I'm Josh Hawley Missouri\nNevada or Arizona Montana North Dakota Indiana New Jersey West Virginia\nThey're afraid of what the results are going to be I'm not afraid of any result we I can deal with whatever hand the American people people deal last\nI just get a little crazy a Claire McCaskill those I'm enjoying um well first of all she's fighting fellow Democrat so she's calling in ads crazy and the Democrats are mad about that and I'll get to that in a second but now with a poll numbers sagging going into the last week of the campaign now Claire McCaskill getting more desperate\nNow she's begging Missouri voters to believe her when she says\nI support President Trump a hundred percent on securing the border\nWell that's odd because I don't think I've ever heard Claire McCaskill ever chant or talk about\nBuilding that wall even once\nBut anyway she told the fake news CNN that she supports the president a hundred percent to do what it takes to secure the border quote the impression he's given Missourians those ... ... I had a cousin from Missouri Missouri what does that people say Missouri others say Missouri Laura\nI well you don't count because you have a language all of your own which is called the ... which is called Philly street talk you know with the added flavor of New York and welcome 'em I support the president a hundred percent oh that desperation\nThat's really desperation I'm I'm I Can't wait to see what the what you might say tomorrow the president's right on everything I just happened to both the wrong way every single time but the last two years\nA we have some new polls out of Florida finding the Senate and governor's races they are statistically tied\nA Florida is the one state I'm worried about in terms of both the Senate and\nI don't understand this obsession with Gillum or the way he stuck taxpayers apparently with travel causes is a fund raising my buddy was getting a lot of money from a we oh that's right we have breaking news on Gillum that I don't we owe undercover tape Mm Hannity nine Easter\n[noise] has a problem they are no longer objective in all of this now it looks very likely that the Republicans are going to see the Senate and\nThey have a fighting chance and people are saying it's a twenty five percent chance I'm telling you I think it's more like fifty fifty right now that the GOP can hold the house and\nSay yes and they they really going to all of a sudden\nDiscovered that oh Russia manipulated this election true is that going to be the play in\nMy block sex night to sit on the patriots am eleven fifty\nAnd President Trump or in a group of Central American ... asylum seekers to turn around before hitting us border functions John decker the White House the\nPresident tweeting our military is being mobilized at the southern border many more troops coming we will not let these caravans which are also made up of some very bad thugs gang members into the U.S the group\nIs still more than a thousand miles away from the border or a federal grand jury has charge suspected Pittsburgh synagogue shooter Robert Bowers was a federal hate crimes including the murder of eleven people the forty for John indictment claims Bowers indicator his desire to kill Jews while opening fire President Trump heads to Florida Today for a GOP campaign rally\nThe president hopes he'll muster support for two Republicans now embroiled in very tight races that's Scott running for Senate and Ron dissent is running for governor Fox's Evan brown outside Fort Myers\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nNow traffic on the patriots am eleven\nFifty [noise] have a closure right now on the one Seventy portion of the Hollywood Freeway only or close between five and Sheldon free speech is insane what's going on here\nIn the meantime the one Seventy ... found is slow from the five down to Roscoe boulevard in the five southbound approaching the one Seventy junction [noise] that's a jammed up right from ... down to languish five north found in the city of ... right\nAround Atlantic boulevard you had an accident in lanes had all gone but the five north down do you have often on reduce speeds from ... to up to the east LA interchange five\nSouthbound just a little bit of sewing heading into Orange County from paramount boulevard to the six o five\nThis report sponsored by Bob Evans refrigerated sides make mealtime easy and delicious with Bob Evans side dishes like mashed potatoes Mac and cheese they're made with real milk butter cheese and potatoes and the ready in the microwave and six minutes try Bob Evans science from your grocery store it'll be love at first bite\nI might Morris you're listening to the Patriot am eleven fifty\nLetters if you're scared you can't just be paralyzed right you can't just step back and wait and hope it will go away\nCalled top tax defenders dot com I have known people to use these folks they deal with the IRS all day every day they'll take over your claim for you they'll deal with the IRS you get back to your life top tax defenders dot com three one zero eight seven eight Ninety six hundred [noise]\nYou\nCan't always get what you want but you can get Sean Hannity on line at ... dot com I ... in this\nIn the door so Nancy Pelosi's agenda [noise] she'll be voting for higher taxes less secure borders and the government run health care scheme that will put seniors many\nDrinks in order to have supported protections for Iowa Lincoln [noise]\n'cause I never forget why [noise] why fight for you [noise] I'm Dave and young I was in the message and\nI'm David Young and I approve this message ... name any way you can get degrees when you think we're going to stand\nRight now there's probably aren't that many\nRadical ...\nDown in Saint Louis and young Brian rumored working man [noise]\nI don't remember where nearly Colombian Army even when we think that we remember these radical agenda\nRight twenty five 'til the top of the hour what am I have been saying no to vote for any Democrat is about ...

a little bit later\nOr in Iowa's third district we gotta fight going on there a lot of outside money coming in as well against David Young\nAnd he joins us now apparently you know I Love these people in the Democratic side they're all saying the same thing health care health care either way welcome to the program David Young appreciate your being with us but\nThey have people that gave us a did they give us Obamacare he'd be a doctor keep your plan and save money\nWell that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the the deficit and debt and rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa shots\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages from Nancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut back\nAnd then lying about their they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we had those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care bill\nYeah a lot of ... listen lying is just a part of it the playbook of the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse and I look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting took place in those Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat does the media but I don't they're blaming Donald Trump port and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his strong support\nWe've got to take care of our American family first and that only enriches us to help others as well and we're the most generous country on earth as I've said so many times has been no

than me I just don't know\nBut I have a feeling there's always this question Donald Trump is changed all the rules in politics I don't think a lot of Trump supporters are going to be telling pollsters they're going to the polls I don't think they're going to take the call and if they find out as opposed to they're going to hang up\nBecause that's what I Would do but I've never gotten any such

comments they want\nWell that that's why I didn't I think that's part of what we're going to trust them as an option\nBecause American alike and Kevin secrets and\nWhat's really happening in the country and the American people I Believe are prepared to reward a party and the movement which has the courage to try to save the country [laughter] got straight from work and so um I Believe the next two years he was going on a great deal\nAbout the nature of America welcome to learn I think that a billionaire liberals can't buy election or because the media and people just shrug off the ranch and say that's not true I don't believe\nWhy are you so confident in the election now I feel pretty good about the Senate\nBut you know I'm always I guess I'll just because I'm Irish but I always uh going into elections I always tell people it's really up to them\nThat's the case this election midterms we have a headwind against us historically speaking only three times in the last hundred years as the party in power in the White House\nOr been able to gain sees it looks like will gain them in the Senate but then we've got you know at least thirty thirty five house races mostly Republicans on defense they're too close to call\nI think that's right now our reasons um you know him\nVery wise there will be\nQuite a bit of a gamer and can be rebel a starting about two thousand and with the Tea Party rebelled earlier when Ronald Reagan on a contract with America a rebellion many ways created from ... then we're in for them that rebellion\nAnd the result is you now have states like North Dakota Montana\nUm jury or the west Virginia where there is a huge base that we believe that they're involved in a college and that causes more than just everyday politics and I think it's it's just fascinating to watch because I think\nThe media doesn't get it show up my mind he's got a little car tomorrow basically search on the planet side which is over\nOr we can we keep

Harvard law can do to change and once they got adopted and it's a healthy debate for us to have is a country because it comes back to exactly the same challenges to care of it are we in the

has\nEvolved Mr Speaker out about it argue from moderate Democrats or I think it is one party one voice leaning solidly socialist left\nVersus those that believe in our constitutional republic limited government greater freedom less government intrusion into our lives I think that is the fundamental disagreement\nLegislature vision of two totally different environment you know there there are America's one in which we don't teach American history we don't want to be American I'm not proud of the flight motion shows will be could count on emotional either the star Spangled Banner\nUh and uh you know we're just one more normal country though to be subordinate or to the you\nKnow in their own because we're the wealthiest country in the world we're only seeing huge amounts of money to other folks are because they'd like to be wealthy challenged the tiny chance that they don't have the money isn't it like you I mean it's just amazing to watch it sure is\nA huge folks are and how much they would basically undermining America for the purpose of variety honest\nThere's a lot at stake I think the most you know if you're barely pay close attention the Democrats stand for nothing\nExcept painting Trump wanting their crumbs back open borders not anything that's going to improve the lives of the ... men and women in this country but there's just because you spend a lot of time with us

researchers needed to we need to find a cure for this devastating disease\nFor more information on this bipartisan bill visit I save team dot org ... eyes save team died\nAnd the only way that she's going to get that capital back history California in orange county and in my district it was the first time in eighty years since FDR ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when\nOrange County and so the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they have zero zero in on us\nThis was really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California raised as being that important\nBut now it's become crucial in terms of you know we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com um that they're really focused in in which means it could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls can\nOf the house or come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money I'm can ...\nExactly yeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\nYeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to do America forward I mean we had the lowest employment in forty nine years as you know in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we are really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era\nToo where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes where you had government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district\nWe have over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the return over the Democrats so we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power they have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS eat\n'em and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job with the people in your\nState and in your district but the you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment or to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out and vote so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now\nAre on the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that come out of Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that uh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it\nGet to a point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the ... you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations and high taxation of states like California and New York Illinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave their liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your dues the unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of that and the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point or in the future and the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California\nYou know have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats than in tight races and one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nA and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you it's not fun running for office who wants to run for office these days\nAre All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day let's go to Mary is in upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called\nWell New York's on the verge of re electing Cuomo and who am I wasn't done a thing for upstate New York\nAnd the fact that Pennsylvania takes all of the natural gas from New York and they were allowed to frack and you see the economy booming and the other side of that border and here we could be literally creating wealth beyond our wildest expectations pretty sad\nVery sad you know what's going on and and\nI I'm In that business as well so for me that's ridiculous I I I was talking to you a few years ago matter of fact it was five years ago today on the health care as a situation because when they rolled out before to ... became affordable\nFor no one that I Know I've especially myself um\nI told you that and my husband had gotten kicked off my plan and um I take extra and I'm getting less coverage and there's tests that I've had 'em that are no longer covered and ah yesterday I had to sit down to do my two thousand Nineteen elections went up\nYet again and less coverage getting dang for tests and things that used to be covered and I'm just I Want everybody to get out there and vote\nBecause we need to continue on our past\nAnd and and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that\nUm and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually was calling to talk about the health care well\nI've got to tell you right now uh it's everybody that is now on the Democratic side they're running on oh we're going to fix health care\nWe're going to know I'm like you're the same idiots they gave us Obamacare keep your doctor keep their plans have less and fundamental it's been a failure and the fact that was true none of it was true was one of the biggest lives that were told them perpetrated on the American people\nUh but anyway Mary thank you I I Wish the people in upstate New York would get the prosperity that they deserve it can be done instantaneously if they would allow fracking up in upstate New York long before they were ever an

... von and others you know paying for a recount other ballads and they found enough new votes\nThat were not counted to\nA well not connected to voters to swing the election is that pretty accurate
