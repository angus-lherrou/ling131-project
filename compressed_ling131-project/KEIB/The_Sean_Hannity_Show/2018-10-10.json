do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else do they stand for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency as only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot or new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago\nIs America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation east kept his promise on building the wall hasn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt bill today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall you know record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for our veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea sanctions\nIran are now paying off we see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he was select from many selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd then twenty eight days or weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people what are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you\nKnow what these tax cuts are working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour you know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation there's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one\nOf them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage have all been breaking stories but you know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know that just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice when she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with the cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company\nAnd told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration of Hillary in May of twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview her Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nA man that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and they exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAnd exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remembered then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney\nOr by the company ... that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait which is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group that went out and hire the former and my six agent\nOr the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August ... Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or\nOr stepped aside and anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's studying in terms of what it reveals since that directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI officials sworn testimony so in other words they lied under oath\nAnd Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was cut out he was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in fact you know its application then for the price of warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that even the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nThe Pfizer application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction\nOf Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton from the get go\nWhich by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials after the OJ and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party being behind all this Clinton dirt\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes us he was on with Maria berets aroma I think on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice for doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the Pfizer warrant to snoop on Trump campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the Pfizer warrant to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without Hillary's involvement here\nIt's so worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you eight five five Ninety four Bible at eight five five nine four B.

James Baker memories the top legal counsel at the FBI\nHas to do with the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously record Donald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnyway it turns out that not long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with President Trump remember this was this was chronicled by both\nThe deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe in and his lawyer Lisa Page that's Peters drugs boyfriend they went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry\nLisa Page was it was she was his boyfriend\nHe was her she was his girlfriend alright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third of official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump after Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through\nIntermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it\nThe thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source close to the investigation of of bakers house interview\nHe was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force

panhandle area we check in with both job of starting the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf\nBut a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola immobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this was a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three or four inches of rain but once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area the weather pattern you remember Florence was\nOff its peak when it hits in North Carolina coast\nThis one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast and I don't expect anything to stop it from being a place that strong category three perhaps even\nA a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much what is the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern when Florence was coming into powder in the uh western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical site clones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese ... you see it snaps came out and said look out October fifth\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic face it you notice all the typhoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely and say well what does that have to deal with as well when the action stops there like a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to cap on ... or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw him once we got so last Thursday and friday you know I'd been shown knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit it off to the east over there with sports this is going right in between and instead of coming west northwest it's hitting it's heading into classical faction from the southwest\nAnd it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately in a lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain\nComing Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right after the to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it\nBut it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas\nOr because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force along the outer banks in forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moved up it's going to accelerate through there\nWhere we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City\nAvailable to use services under what Gavin Newsom is proposing for everybody it's basically putting a sign out that would say hey free health care in California just make it here and we'll take area\nAnd you know people are going to do they're going to make it there and use the California health system and remember California already has a state income tax of Thirteen and a half percent\nYou know add that to a federal income tax and the fact that you can no longer the duck after the tax cut plan passed you could no longer\nCaught or the duct rather your state income taxes on your tax return means that if you do make money in California you're paying that much more in taxes\nSo the people of California are hit harder than any other state in the United states and New York is where I Am is right behind them just ridiculous\nThe amount of the burdens that they're putting on the people of California and Dianne Feinstein is up for reelection it's gonna be interesting to see if ah Gavin Newsom will pull her down in terms of the polls but anyway we'll we'll have to watch that race a little more closely and see what happens all the way we do have\nAn attempt by the ... Democrats than out threatening to impeach and continue the investigations into judge Kavanaugh and um\nThey want to now begin the process of impeaching them to the house Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler will just strongly implied impeachment would be on the table of Democrats take over the lower chamber in the midterms\nIs there anybody in the Democratic party that's running on any agenda item

Eighteen\nAnd the strong account economy has been touted by people like Larry Kudlow called it\nThe hottest economy in the world but there's no doubt it's for the proof is in the ...\nUm you know it's an interesting piece by my buddy Hugh Hewitt Trump may be outside of our norms but he is the seating for all of us and I I just read a little bit of the article I didn't finish it yet\nBut I think what he's saying there's a point that I've been making as well except in a different way and that is that if you look at any criticism of Donald Trump it's all stylistic stuff\nHome out of style they don't like that is combative they don't like that he breaks dishes they don't like that he fights they don't like that he is at times not polite\nUm they don't like that he is a disruptor an iconic class they've got their image of how a president needs to behave in an act in what they should say and that they shouldn't be tweeting and this and that the problem with that is to be get rid of that side of Donald Trump you get rid of what we elected\nThe disruption is good breaking dishes\nIn a swamp lake DC is ending up being a good thing for the American people that's why the jobs that are

OJ face consequences\nRegarding sizable he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned\nThat those infamous discussions about secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ... and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president using the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was a scientific ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed that the source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI\nI remember that you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot\nAnd he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates that already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story ladies' Baron extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people that the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease but investigative reporter is what the hell reg Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax thank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe've got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein\nJust before that we had people like ... Lisa Page in and Peter Struck talking about uh media elite strategy\nThat had to do with the dusty a while it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes and again ... all was was the dot CA recycled in different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ...\nTaping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nWell if there's one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that really I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from Margaret in may and they still have anywhere from a ... a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he get fired and once the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that roses have a a Medicaid and a stroke page\nIt's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove he's confident and will will record him\nAnd uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment this is not what the FBI with ... with ear I'm sure record talking about the history book lays out a real possibility that this was a soft crew right look at this we have the FBI investigating a crime here that\nFact they can't find a crime by a page\nHas all these well at least ... pages testimony just to be clear she said they and they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nIt just says that job for the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it so you've got the FBI the deputy attorney general\nOr allegedly have a conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAgain and again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jerry why every FBI guy I Know it was so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that this was them they know they\nGet fired that's right and in fact I interviewed former

recommended the firing of combing number two we was the one that that recommended the special counsel Robert Mueller number three is also the guy that signed the fourth financial advisor warrant\nIn other words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associate\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to see color it secretly recorded conversations with President Trump\nAnd the ... say something that they could use and then and vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker said it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following as\nWe as a pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS in our research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... same dusty a that was never corroborated a verified but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associates\nAnd it gets worse than that it was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used when our understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers who've die by the name of Michael's such but directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenty sixth election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton at the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance now the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer warrant\nWiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself\nAnd you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants and permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and Greg Jarrett continue with us or anything I'm saying here that is wrong\nRight Jared you got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian\nCollusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composers it totally fabricated phony document\nBased on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed\nAnd yet on July thirty first two thousand and sixteen\nThey officially\nA launch this investigation Peter Struck\nSigned the papers he had just finished meeting with Christopher Steele and in fact the same day that James Comey cleared Hillary Clinton twisting the long could towards the facts his FBI was meeting for the first time in Europe in a building with Christopher Steele\nWho had composed this phony ... that the FBI was never able to verify and yet they ran with this dilate in investigation to damage Trump and then\nThey violated other federal regulations that say you may never use on verified information to gain a fight so wiretap warrant on an American citizen and they never had it verified Rosenstein signed off on the final renewal application\nAnd he had no new evidence ...\nBecause it does the I I Will take a quick break we'll come back more Greg Jared Sean Solomon and your calls later in the program eight

get the special counsel may you know using the same source of information but making it appear like there are numerous sources ear so they're all saying the same thing so creating enough smoke so that there would be right fire\n'em and all the FBI guys they all knew it wasn't true from the beginning Lisa Page even testify to that effect\nThat's right I mean you cannot use double triple quadruple here say from anonymous sources to launch an counterintelligence investigation that is strictly prohibited yet shown that is exactly what the FBI and the de OJ did and what John\n... exactly right there there's a there's a guy that testified a few weeks ago that they can get a lot of attention on script guy but his name is bill priest that\nHe was ... strokes boss she was the chief of counter intelligence that the FBI he told\nHe told the congressional uh a committee that at the time they were submitting advice using that information from Christopher ... they had just gotten betting if they hadn't and yet the standard for the five is it must be substantiated before you can submit it to the court records it exactly right\nThey they hadn't even begun to substantiate process and get through using it presenting it as fancy to verify the court when you look at this\nPoint they willingly lied before buys a port and light it as an advisor court application and they also purposely withheld key information like have you back that Hillary pay for it or how much of these are crimes here\nOh you know just the vice alone\nIs deprivation of rights under color of law known as abusive power so-so perjury because they signed off on it or under penalties for perjury it's obstruction of justice\nIs also a conspiracy to defraud the government to fight the court is in existence\nBecause when we get all these ... applications John that the president said he wanted the class or non redacted when are we going to get the war and so what are we going to get the thrill to lose we don't we know that Bruce or was working with Christopher Steele Christopher Steele is trying to pass on information\nAbout is phony lying ... even Robert Mueller for crying out loud\nThat's right with the president and I was listening for the Justice Department nightmare guy who said hey there might be problems here we don't really watch that you that he should keep in mind this is the Justice Department that hit from the American public and the court for more than Eighteen months the fact that he had to be paid for the main evidence used to open an investigation of Trump's campaign\nBut I

...\nOr the God Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I got in a bad accident right\nRight and you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for long term care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last you know really eight ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is ensure less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility at Seventy in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches or it's an emergency you know a lot of the tree and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet health care is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and it happened and how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you've you've been out and about and a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this modern last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nYeah and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of doc a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was a physician run health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table when ever having conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions about getting back to the table to have this conversation\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that with some erupt southwest Florida ... ... any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nSolid does is create obstacles to access some ... some ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come from all over the state of liberty and even from outside of the country\nWe're seeing some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it and you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because the ...\nOne of the insurance if you don't trust drives up the cost of the other products so whenever I cashed parks Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so but I'm pleased to see what the you know we're shifting the conversation from a coverage for every\nWhen I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care that real close enough I was about ... upon us some help committee on the ...\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock\nGather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody whether your pay our taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick um because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nOff for every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that's sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of if but the big things heart attack\nA accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month or so\nAnd the current rate is closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send him an originality\nDestroying more money at the problem is never fixed it\nSo you what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get much cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nI'm actually looking at ways it fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending and if I could add\nTo that just a a book you know the cost of course you know people ask us was can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well I'm I'm a care made that illegal\nOr so something little stretching just brought offshore export with access to these major medical plan is called ... short term medical ... and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses for Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this going to be implemented easily\nCity by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nEverybody's welcome everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over and not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nBoy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that\nAre doctors and forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership\nWe do the same thing and we're able to get the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those because they're going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWell they're gonna have to move to New York because they don't make it easy but they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the a few states that make it very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take your New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um you know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills of blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand\nPills I can and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than what\nAbout Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we've wage you down with regulatory burden so we're going to cut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can\nWrite a quick break we'll come back more Dr Josh amber outlets MD and Dr Lee as grows president ah docks for a patient care foundation\nThe

it made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile per hour winds very close to a category five so powerful it could hit Georgia as\nAnd if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael and it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast\nThrough Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect at that point it's probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline kept five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and uh on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher ... over a million power outages we expect occurring\nAnd not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak rainfall flooding is gonna be a significant threat\nCarolinas so uh everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina if you're in North Carolina\nYou know you can make your preparations now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with your pack the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers with everybody in harm's way today this is this is the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you they're leaving it it's not as bad as they say it's gonna be this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's gonna be\nThe worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida that's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow\nSame thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth would most generous people on earth\nAnd whatever our friends in Florida Georgia the Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half\nHe is the person in May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me\nHe is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew all the fourth ... application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the face of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legally\nExpense now he was now are supposed to testify because three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week James Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office\nTaping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he is denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse\nAnd the impasse over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional taskforce interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aide said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and have him testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talked about why signs of the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he sign off on a document himself talked about well with regards to find a civil warrants you know that it was an affidavit and career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nIf there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the dusty a was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents when questioned in in in Iraq a tour and Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true it's just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially fights application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them\nA hundred million is zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... operation of what the insurance policy was\nInsurance policy is that you have people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation\nLisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tax confirmed that there is no there there but anyway then they started ... media elite strategy all coming from the same stores which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA and it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint\nRod Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to lease to page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing too is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nOr Judiciary Committee the house are in the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why what eight especially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath you know and people worry about that just asked Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is\nInto a destructive of fish they can't get enough of us to vote with them so they get this mandated by legislators in black robes on the Supreme Court violating

David they gotta Pfizer warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal buys an application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked\nWhich is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller and uh now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nWell the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions for Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a deal Jake two on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is I let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nI think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nImportant questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena ... we've got to bring

them you write for\nCall today and good story\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics to the past with the Republican Party which you're intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist besides you just you know the if the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics when he said Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then I Will get it back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just unless it's not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spiced up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says\nUh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats are in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Garrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs ... will it last over the course of the next four weeks\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the ...\nAnd of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim you\nReally can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation a ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is done and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness they just care about their own political agenda however misplaced and wrong it may be\nAnd show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is then they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want board Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republican celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the end you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American to have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it's a host\nAnd and a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this rage not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe thinks he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what are you have to do you have to oppose the trader you\nHave to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the cabinet so that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left and I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen\nWhen is enough enough you attack this this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's faces and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how on a legal basis impeachment is not possible\nFor Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals' and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than Brock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and I and that is not\nJust made up the I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity 'em and add money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I did like Kevin McCarthy introduced which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars he needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the AIDS and the health of some of the justices that there's no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near future\nYeah and and don't forget showing that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell you most of these cases that are ... reports to American businesses American individuals\nMoms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump had already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to have to be confirmed as well\nSo this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat a you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection it may come open\nI ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if you give Berg decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's gonna happen\nIf that seat comes open as a potential six three conservative majority and the courts\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at a at a again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen\nI quit break we'll have more a dam bond Gino and Greg Jared on the other side listen I\nDeep state COBOL inside of the federal government that is working against the president's interest in
