and Carmen Robert functioning\nTo me we've had too many shootings at schools at churches in this particular case this is the largest anti Semitic shooting in the history of the United states\nAnd you know when the president says that you know having armed guards at school or I've been advocating for a long time now retired police retired military\nOn the perimeter in the property on every in every hall of every school\nAnd that's one way to protect our children and I always ask a simple question and it's not to me about a gun debate if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter would you prefer that there are that you know that there are trained professionals\nIn that building with firearms as a first line of defense especially knowing that most of these shootings are over ... seconds\nAnd even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments it's usually by the time they get there it's it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect in in an orderly fashion those who either or injured or weren't injured\nSo it's a thought um it's been used before but that's not our big story of the day the saddest thing I watched all we got to watch very closely and even hearing my name brought up a number of times and you know just shaking my head because people obviously know nothing about me\nThey know nothing about you know they don't take the time the either bother to watch or listen to this program if you've been listening to the program\nYou know we have been decrying going back to Kavanaugh the angry mobs in Washington ... ... ... bidding at senators not letting them closed doors there we've been talking about how dangerous the left wing\nA mentality is ... and we've talked about the incidences of Sarah Sanders and her family or kids trying to get something to eat secretary Nielsen trying to get something to eat\nYou know we talked about Pam Bondi trying to go see a movie Mitch McConnell walk into an airplane numerous times and Mitch McConnell have it as his table slammed on food ripped off his table just last weekend Kevin McCarthy's office having a Boulder sent through it\nYou know and I've been saying it it's we've got these everybody's gotta stop\nNow we've been talking about the rhetoric we heard Hillary you can't be civil kick them Eric Holder and talking about Maxine Waters a lot\nYou know if you see these cabinet members you get a crowd or does she thinks is going to happen when the crowd is formed and you follow them into restaurants and department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted any anywhere anymore\n... how is that going to end well\nTold the story when I met senator what's\nThat guy's name from Connecticut again ... looming fall when I was coming out there who was in the middle of the capital hearings you know I don't I don't understand being rude to somebody just because you have a political disagreement\nWe had a very pleasant conversation\nI invited him on my show I don't know what came of it but nothing obviously but I don't know where he's thinking about it what is the point of being rude to people are getting in people's faces says Cory Booker Spartacus says why is there this anger out there\nThat we have you know all these bombs that are sent out\nThe first one went to George Soros and I said that day I said this this has got to stop\nAnd George Soros is no fan of Sean Hannity's funds groups that wants me to be silenced and go away but that's not what we do in this country we protect people you're allowed to have political views and spend your money the way you you see fit in life\nAnd even if it's being spent to silence made you know what I still believe in free to\nOr the ... you know I don't want to see any politician hurt\nAnd I have consistent consistently over the years said that\nWhen President Obama and people you know threatening him and people race how do we let how does somebody get into the White House says that happened we've got to protect our elected officials we have one president at the time we got it that represents the United states and that represents all of us\nAnd at the end of the day the powers in the ballot box but you know you watch something like what happened this weekend and you watch the Democratic party their lap dogs in the media wasted no time you know trying to politicize this terrible shooting over the weekend pin blame the massacre\nOn President Trump look if the president says fake news is not serving the people of this country you can chronicle it you can watch it they don't see it which is sad their views and their bias and they're abusive a platform\nBut the reality is they live and they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape or form of calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter this guy Rodney ... hours by the way he hated President Trump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated the fact that President Trump and I think he can make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has aligned with Israel more than any other president in modern times you know Trump surrounded by a slur for Jewish people and then that heat the this killer lamenting there's there's no maggot as long as there's a you know\nBad word of a quote in ... infestation but despite those facts you have people\nYou know pretty close to blaming the president and conservatives for the shooting Joe Biden widely expected to run for the presidency seemed to do so when he tweeted that the president's words matter silences complicity what does he talking about Paul Krugman New York times suggesting that Trump was to blame at least in part\nSpeaking sarcastically Krugman tweeting all linked to the story with the caption but no but none of the white supremacist terrorism as anything to do a Trump oh no\nIt's unbelievable how they now have you know believe their own lives Alan Dershowitz had a powerful column and the Daily Caller today and\nHe's been a a passionate defender over the years a staunch defender and rightly so of Israel\nAnd Jewish civil rights anyway drew linked this morning and pointed out something the very few are willing to say and he said a day after a man killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue he criticized presidents Obama and Clinton as well as\nKeith Ellison this is Alan Dershowitz and then went on\nFox and friends this morning there can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism we have to have zero tolerance President Obama meets with Farrah Khan they hit the picture for eight years\nShame on him but now we have the picture President Clinton sits on the same platform with Farrakhan shame on him\nKeith Ellison joins with ferret conference con one of the greatest purveyor of anti medicate just because he's black doesn't give him a pass on anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with Farrakhan as part of the problem not the solution\nThe Pittsburgh massacre comes just two weeks after ... you know called Jewish Americans termites and that's mild compared to the the anti Semitism anti Semitism in the past and is that racism is well\nYou know this is rarely bashing Trump Peter Linder saw sore after the ... massacre in Pittsburgh where hearing where new calls to have a national conversation\nWell as long as we don't overlooked some of the obvious suspect\nYou know if you look at some of the ... the history now with the Democratic party that don't seem to be the supporters of Israel they once were and it's not limited just the Farrakhan you know you have Palestinian activists Linda source or well known that\nYou know she was up a lead organizer of the anti Trump woman's march where Madonna's said she'd dreamed an awful lot about blowing up the White House was not so well known as the association that many prominent elected Democrats have what's our store\nYou know and and just the last year she's been campaigning alongside some of the Democratic party's most celebrated a rising star alec Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez no wonder Cortez has adopted many of our shores well radical positions and it was Kirsten Gillibrand's herself introduced at a rally buys source store and last week had Lou reiterated his support for Linda is our store\nAnd she's been campaigning for Michigan house a candidate\nRashid a tele move vows to vote to slash aid to Israel when she gets in Congress in August Bernie Sanders was campaigning weather and we're beginning to see something here is democratic candidates increasingly\nKnow they're they're being seen with the most radical types of if it was if it was Trump I can assure you there'd be a lot of people speaking out\nAll right we have a lot more to talk about we'll talk about how you know Fox is under fire I'm under fire house never Trump or is it just so bitter and angry that they can't stand how wrong they were they they want to do everything possible to align with the most radical elements in the Democratic party\nOr it makes sense invest in your workforce and they'll invest in your business\nThat trade Sean and an investment

President Trump because he thought Trump was quote controlled by Jews and not only that part of Trump's family is Jewish\nAnd and so on and so forth you know apparently it you know as Ron ... rightfully said oh this weekend on Fox News that you know these burial an anti Semite can come from any side of the political spectrum\nAnd if you look at the persecution that has taken place and this was something that the president raised the Jews have endured terrible persecution over the years\nWe've read it we studied it they've gone through it all and we still see so much of it it is growing by leaps and bounds sadly all across Europe it's getting scary\nAll these countries that seek Israel's destruction radical Islam is Iranian mullahs chanting death to Israel or president said we will seek their destruction which is standing holy behind in the right way Israel or as so many people\nHave been you know victims of anti Semitism\nYou know Sarah Sanders pointing out is there any tragedy the Washington Post won't exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump but there's the president is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nWe haven't had a president in modern history that has stood by our closest friends and allies Israel in the middle east ever and what an act of courage was apparently but there's other presidents have promised that never did it\nAnd making Jerusalem the rifle capital of Israel [noise]\nAnyway we're going to get to all of that that Fox News

we've had a lot leading up to all of this and go back to the Kavanaugh hearings I didn't hear many people on the left to cry the angry mobs that were going on in the halls of Congress I I got to the point where I said probably it's better if we've cleared the halls of the public\nOr you would think in the people's house that the people would be allowed to go where they are elected officials are but it was obviously becoming\nUnsafe for people senators being spit at you saw the treatment of you know we've had in recent weeks but do we have rice and sent or what was supposed to be rice and sudden to Susan Collins home during the cabinet Harry's Law coat hanger sent to her office et cetera\nWe've watched than in recent weeks racing or what they've said wars rice and being sent to the president and General Mattis and our FBI Director right and our CIA director Gina Haspel\nWe watched the last few weeks what we watch these mobs and people being run out of restaurants\nYou know Sarah Sanders in her kids and family secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi Ted Cruz Mitch McConnell airports and having his table slammed in his food thrown out the restaurant door\nI've been telling everybody that the rhetoric is too hot and too heated and people need to come down but nobody on the Democratic side ever decided to stand up and say this this has gotta stop\n\nOn this program I set it when Obama was president it's got to stop we got to protect our elected officials the day that they mailed this the\nFirst device was sent to George Soros his house first thing I said on the radio I said we've got ... this can happen in this country\nI Know he's not a fan of mine in any of the people that were threatened by these bombs but the rush to politicize this and turn this into well this is who conservatives are is just one big lie\nWhat you're watching unfold before you're very eyes is you know the race to politicize tragedies thank God those twelve or Thirteen PVC bombs didn't go off and nobody lost their life thank God\nThat was in Donald Trump's fault\nAnd then you can you know look at this terrible tragedy and they're shooting in the synagogue or this rabid anti Semite racist and also a Trump ... not that it should even be relevant\nIt's getting scary\nWe had real bullets used over the weekend also to shoot up a Republican Party headquarters in Florida\nYou know and that could have killed people\nSouth Daytona police investigating after they said that someone shot out the window of the local county Republican headquarters belief set of worker arrived Monday morning saw the damage called authorities we have another threat of a man has accused the guy who's been arrested\nBy threatening to kill Florida congressman Carlos Curbelo\nThat story came out this week yet he's been threatened there was a campaign rally would Lindsey Graham and Marsha Blackburn and you had an angry leftist mob disrupt disrupting that and a half a dozen angry liberal protestors they had to be removed\nIt's not true it's never been true and it's not any conservative\nI Would ever support and then the case of this guy that shot up the synagogue it was a very ill and anti Semite who also hated Donald Trump\nBut that doesn't stop them from saying and literally advancing that narrative\nYou know this is you know watch watching the Washington Post alone is unbelievable Fox deserve their headlights Fox News and the rest of the right wing media can escape responsibility oh\nI've been the biggest supporter of Israel that I Know in the mainstream media have been my entire career friends with Bebe Netanyahu going back decades than there during the war and been there at other times reporting\nShowing people the tunnels that nobody else in the media would show them friends who they who Brock formally Shimon Peres\nLet's name names according to the Washington Post Trump's hate and lives are inciting extremist oh this extreme is in the synagogue hated Trump was at the Washington Post headlines that you got\nFrom the G O P defiant amid allegations that incendiary rhetoric these are the same people on CNN fake news they\nCouldn't identify 'em up for who they are\nThese phony hypocrites Trump blames and you know something when the media live twenty four seven and they get called out that's too bad that is not a call for violence\nUnbelievable the times that we're living in now here is um where we are the Senate is interesting 'cause there's two races you can add maybe to the let's watch column\nAnd I would say that would be West Virginia where Joe Manchin is down by two in the latest poll and Menendez is barely hanging on to a lead in New Jersey by three now do I think both of those races are going to be won by Republicans\nAh maybe West Virginia New Jersey's heart ... possible people in New Jersey\nClearly fed up with an end us then I think it's too close to call on either the gubernatorial race I have no idea why Floridians are flirting with Guillaume ... got a radical agenda in Florida Rick Scott stone a fan passed\nA job as governor and he'd be a perfect complement for the Republican majority in the Senate I think Marsha Blackburn hangs on we got Josh Hawley now in the lead in Missouri we got Dean Heller holding on to his lot hopefully that's an important race in Nevada\nI don't know why Christ in similar cinema well we've got new tape on cinema tonight that will blow that case wide open\nDon't see how somebody who supported Americans joining the Taliban could win in Arizona and calling her own state crazy and the meth lab of democracy and inviting radical lawyers for the blind shake I don't know how she survives\nHeidi Heitkamp I don't think she's going to win in North Dakota that'll be a pickup as long as the people of Indiana don't vote for the libertarian and split the ticket\nThe Republican their Braun should be able to win that race and that would be a pickup for Republicans\nI think Montana's a little bit and play but I'd say favoring pastor at this moment protest or can be beaten there\nAnd I think the biggest thing is I'm looking at real clear politics and the battle for the house race they have two hundred and five likely Democrats and Republicans two hundred and the rest you have some thirty toss up seat that have gone to\nDefine or tip the balance of power John James by the way is now only within six against Avon out he was one soundbite twenty you'd be he's a totally great rising star in the Republican Party and I think it'd be great we'll see what happens but you know I think the house can flip so there are three possible\nScenarios a week from this Wednesday the day after one is Republicans rock the world and shocked the world again and they help hold on to the house pick up Senate seats that's the ideal\nFor eight days and there's a split decision they hold on to the Senate pick up seats but it's speaker elect below sea that split decision and the worst case scenarios speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nThese important race as we have on Hannity dot com thank you Linda for reminded me hey listen you've got to keep your home and family safe it's a dangerous

you're with us eight hundred nine four one showing toll free telephone number eight days till election day one week from a tomorrow that was the president talking about the Pittsburgh synagogues synagogue shooter um we're letting getting to know a lot more about Robert\nBowers and who he is he was a very ill an anti Semite he was a huge critic of Donald Trump or in a lot of ways\nUm and the president you know took heat for saying what that means maybe and we've talked about this after school shootings and after other church shootings\nWhere the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all those says we continue rose ten and I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows um plugged in Pittsburgh, PA\nUgh long friend of the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nAh you know how much I Love but friends in Pittsburgh rose I'm very very sorry your thoughts and prayers go to everybody or the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes beat my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning\nI mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear the list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular Pittsburgh neighborhood I go there to shop and to dying and then in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the the ... considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects\nAnd not just their community but the out if the surrounding communities\nAnd as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl who is cut and with the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it just it's heartbreaking it\nReally is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things and immediately I got sick thinking that this is going to become political\nAnd it did it you can count the seconds\n... there's an interesting side note that there is no throw those to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turn against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful column that he put out linking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan\nI'd never ever get in a room with a vicious racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan\nOr picture that emerged with Farrakhan and\nObama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we have had\nSince the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nThat any person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as an anti Semitic bone in his body is that of their mind look in his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr fabric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling with Farrakhan members of Congress

program Ralph Reed is back with us a\nHe is the founder of the chairman of the faith and freedom\nCoalition and CEO of of century strategies and look he was part of the Christian Coalition back in the day when they paid played such a powerful force in American politics in many ways he has rebuilt the Christian Coalition in terms of\nGetting out mailers and and making contacts with voters all around the country key races\nNow in the Senate will watch in Florida it's a dead heat and that is both the Senate with Rick Scott and that's for governor and run to Santa says a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle and people showing up in the panhandle you had a very tight race for governor in the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back\nTowards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it's ... if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett us and we have British students team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin on that he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers progressing calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall hold but people have got to get up to vote 'em we see Josh Hawley is doing very well and he's up by a couple of percentage points in Missouri against that phony Claire McCaskill\nAnd she's bragging about how she really politically it's just like Obama but she too like bread as soon as hiding who she really is Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota's down by double digits she also was exposed by project Vera ... uh we now have\nIn a Braun in Indiana he's up by a couple of points against incumbent Joe Donnelly a Democrat the only the only factor\nThere that I really see is there's a libertarian that's drawing votes away from the Republican so if you're in Indiana do vote libertarian or else that's like a half a vote for Donnelly we've got to hold the seat\nHeld her seat in Nevada right now he's currently up in the polls but it's always tightened Nevada and then Arizona I have no idea why poll came out this weekend showing Christian send them other Democrat up on war hero twenty eight year veteran\nSix tours of duty Iraq and Afghanistan Martha make Sally especially with cinema calling the people of Arizona crazy and saying Arizona's the\nMeth lab of democracy and inviting the attorney for the blind shake to Arizona State university and saying right after nine eleven was perfectly fine of Americans want to join the enemy and joined the Taliban I don't have a problem with it anyway he believes that he can help get out the vote Ralph Reed is with us\nThat's the Senate do you agree with my assessment\nActor Sean we're uh we're currently are contacting twenty six million evangelical and pro life pro family Catholic voters and Nineteen states we knocked on a million nine hundred seven thousand if you're under twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not that we're counting and\nAs of this weekend five point eight million of the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day\nWe think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had an internal actually well\nI Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I look at ras muses number the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide here\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats at two o five Republicans are two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and Sean ... are it by the people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is ignored the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the ...\nAnd everybody tells me you know I make a living for people not ignoring\nYour except it okay but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia where we elected the first Republican governor and that stayed in a hundred and thirty four years\nBut that's life lock dot com one eight hundred life lock promo code Hannity we'll

none of them have spoken at all about the caravan their silence is deafening and they'll say is well Republicans talking about it means that they're they're racist and Xena phobic it no it just means we believe in the rule of law\nAnd we're not going to wait the four weeks so\nYou know seven fourteen thousand people make it here\nSo I think that's playing a part I think all the incidence of the mob on the Democratic party side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up\nA Republican headquarters in Florida\nWe saw the terrible shooting in the Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican congressmen\nHave an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans punched in Minnesota or there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left you see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nUh Pam Bondi run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy's office it with a Boulder busting his office window so there's a lot of left wing violence out there and it's a pretty dangerous time\nYeah and I think a anytime you're dealing with uh this kind of pervasive dark the most important thing that you can do is light a candle and I think what people have got to do is they got to resist that hate with a love for their country a love for their fellow man\nAnd hope for better future for all of our citizens stay positive stay prayer full and work hard you know I

five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border not download fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico um but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them and who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any end it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this\nThat's the only bit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis she's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program sir glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me no pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column midnight I haven't read the whole column yet but what if my read a bit is is you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question what on the Mark I'm in the la actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guy's been organized this folks from my party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of the of the president and the lady who basically tried to uh overthrow the constitutional making ... a life there and done with the Venezuelan and laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos and\n[laughter] for from the more so again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and that is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American government look bad and our allies look that\nWell I mean look the America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws\nAre constitutional republic American sovereignty and come in\nAnd if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself and don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process and maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity does not seem to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also a nation of laws come in according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered by the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border\nWhy is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to get him just out of stuff if that's the principal well\nWhat I'm I'm married I was I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and people rush across our border being at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border\nThe military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here are coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\n... ugly down at the sun shine we don't want to be heard and also it is undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff on the look probably been lied to the beginning I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nUm so they are being put him in the middle of this I'm simply used as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible raunchy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country and\nTimes and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I've I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall of an end fencing and I can look across the fence\nOn the other side and Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding will look like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or you know million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people but\nWe can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way and it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument is just what we have to do for our own safety\nThere without question of what you just described is most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who will control the border\nThat we are supposed to allow three to four billion people move here because that is what you were actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion obviously cannot do that we have to maintain control of\nYou know All right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight

Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this was real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate\nRepublicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house or it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nVery Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go full for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirement\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses\nBecause Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters is a\nCommittee chairwoman and Adam Schiff as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman it just it's a disaster for us eight

identified actually if you look at real clear politics they have they ever narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point is actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey ... they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats and\nThe remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words if we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when

out campaigning hard every single day eating every corner of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to feed the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back beyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we

that well the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know St Trump cause this promise responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show\nA desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking on both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to do to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight and one\nDay after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the word speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it the worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan and Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody there were candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate and he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four\nWhere the media again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know you go back and you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty four team you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics as the Democrats have two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they called toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself and\nThe only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media and twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think is going to the next president Frank Luntz who's reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost\nIt ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data I had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong in twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans were even set off because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen one\nYear before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival because in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nThe expert such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty four team Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty four team midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the G O P not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine feet Senate landslide\nHow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but uh yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into a all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world\nAll that but an old for it's happened in fourteen and it happened and sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou shouldn't do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six the this is a this is a white latch CNN was reporting\nThat night anyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that\nNone of them thought in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control\nKind of similar where they are now the G O P claim they similar one point advantage lead in ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggest a narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term\nAnd you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal\nThey were saying they might they might well twenty ten was kind of a two touchdown embarrassing loss for Democrats this is more Republicans went on a field goal\nIt never happens instead we keep watching his critics self destruct Trump's opponents melt down now practically every day over the fact that Trump is melting down by melt down over the fact that they can't make Trump melt\nDown Rush Limbaugh tomorrow morning

and millennia go to Pittsburgh today after the terrible\nShooting in the synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday and no one in the media and all the people in the media there actually blaming Donald Trump for this it's outrageous it is ugly\nIs twisted it is sick it is the family story and frankly the there's there's gotta be some legal standard at some point\nThat you ought to be able to sue\nFor such slander and libel those comments like this anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi you know who watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's\nNow become the political targeted and he's receiving hate mail\nFor saying he would welcome the president to his place of prayer it's unbelievable anyway you had all these wonderful people they're going to praise God and the temple and their gun now\nAnyway the organization told reporters they now have received three phone calls today a loan from a non identified man swearing and angry at them they wouldn't elaborate exactly what the caller said they did tell reporters that it was anti Semitic and pro Trump\nWell the guy powers that was responsible for this murder and terror in the synagogue was anti Trump and his Ron ... has said the ambassador to Israel as a Bebe Netanyahu has said\nYou know they never heard any one president ever say stand up that if you destroy\nOur friends our allies in Israel we will destroy you which by the way is the way it should be you\nDon't get to kill innocent men women and children in a synagogue\nIt's unbelievable the ... the race the rush to politicize pretty much anything and everything\nThat is Donald Trump\nYou know the rabbi said on CNN Trump is my president he's always welcome to visit\nYou know ever since yesterday morning of the fake news fraud media's been circulating what is just the ... nation is why that somehow Pittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre\nRose tenant friend of this program she was on with those yesterday you know she exposed this is their hateful garbage abroad that it is and saying those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community\nThe Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political group\nAnd they want to give them any attention\nAnd then anyway anyway so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful\nI mean how pastors and priests and you know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know\nIt takes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my president the president of the United states is always welcome to visit\nYou know you could see the hostility about all things conservative Republican\nYou know I call for security and peace and people do take out their differences at the ballot box\nBut that doesn't stop them they're so desperate to get noticed\nSo desperate to help

uh because I think they realize that this is an important race for the future of Florida that's good news for a\nWhile but you got you running for rich Scott's seat Rick Scott a would love to see him we did a great job as governor of Florida and I'd love to see him go to the U.S Senate that too is a tight race\nLet's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved\nWell this guy was posing as a developer a he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that's in a legal gift ended up itself Andrew never reported it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in Tallahassee and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release where that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby its body of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWasn't he got arrested isn't that buying influencing corruption\nWell there's an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's going to happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence\nAndrew also the same lobbyists that arrange that New York John get paid for for night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAndrew didn't pay a dime at that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the aging gave to go on the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaigned on twenty sixteen that was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you can't report after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks CYA so it only interested in report\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas or one of the lobbyist attorneys release that for the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton\nAndrew says he's not under investigation but Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate\nYou know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it's now out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark and er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew get one picked this guy knowing that he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum\nHe is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders\nWhich is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement targeting Israel they actually say Israel the genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day\nOpposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and when a Israel fought back against the Hamas attacked and may ah Gillum blamed Israel you know they just use those attacks as a pre tax it'd be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is really ... organization that he won't deserve out\nThere one of the most radical organizations in Florida ah they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be the funded they say they say the U.S is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their word with socialist principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro wash so key sign their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifest there so that just who he is he believes and what they're doing\nIs endorse them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's please them proud to a snake food\nTo dream defender activists during a thirty day sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol referring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement they're anti free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know what I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from the left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nLonging for a liberator these other

millions of dollars coming from former New York city Mayor Bloomberg\nWho is supporting all of the Democratic candidates in California\nAnd why not I mean Governor Brown is doing such a bang up job

Darryl ... old seat Dana Rohrabacher seat a Duncan Hunter see that really are seeing a fortune in your seat thrown at them in terms of\nThese are really being targeted as tipping point races at in terms of the balance of power in Washington one week from today or how much money's being thrown at against you and toward your opponent\nWell I think I'd go back to that old the old commercial for a kind of hot sauce and say New York city because that's what's happening in my district a New Yorkers are throwing a ton of money out here I think we're now number one in California for most money being spent in a congressional district\nA that's not something I Want it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nYou know what do you think the colds or what was in the bottom line is they're throwing money and they're running negative ads because negative ads work and money helps get out the vote you know they'll use that for you know people knocking on doors they'll use it to tax people to use it to reach out a hundred different ways\nAnd that puts you at a decided disadvantage now\nI kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want is freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races\nAre obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\n[laughter] why I think that's probably the reason but he's also looking at districts that he thinks he can he can do something there uh this is this has been a held by Republican for very long time and we're going to win the seat\nBut ah yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's come in here it's it's gotten to a saturation point now and people are just so upset\nI think

and wanted\nAnd they forget that\nPeople with a pre existing conditions well with Obamacare you pay more higher premiums than any other plant\nRate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lied to you

call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum and I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress in the Senate as we move forward and\nThere are a couple of
