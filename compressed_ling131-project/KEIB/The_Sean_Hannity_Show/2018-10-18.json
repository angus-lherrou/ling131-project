say you know they now is not sure that with any uncertainty new uncertainty over whether or not the wall or the wave will materialize contrary to the fake news media predictions democratic GOP voter registrations were at the exact same level as they have been in the\nPast election cycles let's say daisy no other way of pay democratic fraud or bring has been uncovered in in Texas picked up by CBS

what is it do to your business my let me tell you right now these companies are in total freak out moment that Sean Hannity did he\nSaudi council and it can be hurt on the tape saying during the show these tortured do this outside you're going to get me in trouble or in another tape\nAnd unknown person again I Can't corroborate doesn't only told me what the New York post and the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper\nIf you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia be quiet anyway returned to Riyadh on Tuesday\nOf a plan search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe into show gaze disappearing that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia Middle East English language website holding a Turkish sources saying that there were no attempt to interrogate\nIt could show he but that us Saudi hip team came to kill him the source told the site that his death took seven minutes forensic physician doctor Salah Mohammed al ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe could show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president hairdo on and the Turkish foreign minister ... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMight bump pay on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts a day after the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nStop us deployment diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged hit team were found to a close ties to the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nSolomon according to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president say they didn't get any tape at this time\nYou have a pro government newspaper reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume that watch exists in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and in body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving Riyadh aid Pompeo told reporters that the Saudi leaders made no exception ... who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying Turkish official Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that that in fact happened on the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi consulate had the ... wire dab transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment\nBecause the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later\nJoining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight\nDefending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan hop but Fox News contributor thirty or CIA up operations officer a doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis\nAssassinating murdering this guy in a a far Paraguay that's what I'm thinking\nTo visit ruined in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned uh I think this man is that whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between\nTwo nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the new often I'm an avid won regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't an American soldiers that trying to spin\nIt was a foreign national read them and it was a common type that you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures\nArab um the ... of the ... century a non ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think uh miss the hot but it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have your back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil brutal brutal way possible and I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we're going we're going to have the truth\nRushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to live that ... entered and we know he just show gay never exited the costs\nAre we do the makeup of those of the safety and Saudis for them apparently part of ... one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly membrane ... body after he was killed\nOr what we don't know\nIt was with the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to hope that they report posts for to those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think was a hundred percent right to just fashioned secretary said the gather the facts emphasize that they ... issue of rape is a concern to us we'll get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin power with poison back in March\nBritish home secretary rod said they needed a voice speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here in the last thing I Would just highlighted that Well Secretary palms hey was meeting and doing it public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legal at Shea in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or in ... in ... probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it to be a part of reviewing it shows\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince says denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had money in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this was that\nUm I think there's there will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nUm but it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat a [laughter] not

when we pay Seventy two cents of every dollar for defense mostly of our Western European allies or\n... you know demanding better more fair trade deals with our Western European partners with Canada with Mexico people don't understand is it\nBeautiful threatened to pull out of a deal and you don't threatened tariffs you're never gonna get the deal and nobody ever thought in the past ... ask for these things and the fact that he not only does it then wins then the American workers all across the country doing better and that that's what brings us to this election\nAnd I'm thinking I don't see any good ideas from the Democratic party that's going to improve the lives of Americans make us more prosperous secure I don't care about it I ... I Want this country mouse burst\nHe also did something that the mainstream media is reporting on the twenty fifth of July the declaration of a ceasefire in Europe was absolutely brilliant Sean because he was able to\nPressure on China from Europe he's affective Lee and people are really reporting is pretty ... joined forces with the Europeans the Europeans also had these trade issues and these trade agreements with China\nAnd so what the president did is rather than fighting a war to directions you declare cease fire in Europe he knows he has to deal with them\nBut they're applying maximum pressure on China and I'm going to make a prediction right if you're on your radio show hopefully it won't bite me back I think you get to trade deals with China before the shock and if not by the end of the year it's a very early in\nThe ... let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these sanctions and tariffs on China China what happened\nThere economy took a thirty five percent dive so that would tell me by now they're probably and I don't know for sure but I'm assuming they're banging on his door begging that they can get those back\nOf course yeah seven percent hit to the currency thirty five percent hit to the stock market\nAnd their their economies grinding down and uh we know about China is they need to create twenty five million jobs you're\nJust to break even shock and so uh if if if the locomotion of growth and progress is stalled uh it'll be cataclysmic for that political system so I Believe they will be at the table or maybe they don't get it done at the G ... which is at the end of November but I bet you they get it out shortly thereafter\nOr because we both know the president's personality he's hitting very very core of but he's a very fair guy and he'll hit the intersection of fairness with the Chinese government are and what is best for the American working families so\nUh and that's why it was all ... and by the way you know I was ... doing a lot of traveling around the country I was in Detroit last night I spoke to three or four hundred people I'm Down here in Miami Today and whisper rate is up you know that whisper rate where saw it on people that they don't like Trump but then they\nPull you aside at his age Sean by the way I happen\nTo really like otherwise isn't that what this group there is an intensity of his supporters

I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just auditor discussed and I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most hating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them is the United states senator\nHad been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri they're they're they're the local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journals do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like all the Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about some of these position I said what about other things she's saying here that she hasn't been public about so they they very much shaped me Sean for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now it's supposed it's something that I've been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and every time they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about that ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is ally and the high who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now ah this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees that McCaskill quote essentially\nHas to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her off the hiding hiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money ... indirect means in order to I guess appeal to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats are shrinking constituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that\nIn order to get elected in a state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when\nThe Democratic party a band in any sense of due process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute Kavanaugh was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so-called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you got these anarchists middle class of benders attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representatives Sarah Anderson punched by an anarchist after trying to stop him from kicking her campaign side\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was this stuff that's sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I may play a little bit on your show last night and she said that now that I quoted she says well it started with Josh Hawley us to her opponent would be part of fraudulent embedding someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she just went on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just\nFalsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri wasn't involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud will will walk by what recording the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own their own their own with our son\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers next to roast about\nHow she's going to impeach Trump that you can tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected that's their words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting to expose the truth and and I think she's gonna have to respond to her response because\nIt's filled with lies and innuendo an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get all of this out and before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates well I have known you know what for a decade or more\n[laughter] that's right yeah I mean ... you know my M. O. a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next to release a candidate of the time we have to United States senators\nAnd their candidates opposing them responding to our investigative work we're lying in their responses were sort of using ... tactics against the landscape feeling skew is to get the reaction and use the reaction in the reaction to the reaction we have two reactions now and we're going to the next state will\nBe releasing another video early next week and a very very a battleground state same theme Sean ... they have to lie and then once they get elected to the new deal bait and switch through\nAnd do what they actually intend to do and it's just on videotapes not my words stopped my claims are not giving you unsubstantiated\nAnd all that people watch it to themselves and they can decide people are pretty smart um\nA James O'Keefe is with us founder and the c._e._o. project very tossed dot com and\nThe videos are up there and you can check 'em out yourself a boat Claire McCaskill and her staff and they'll reticent and his staff and now he's telling us there's more to come we'll come back we'll take a quick break we'll come back and continue eight hundred nine four one showing a toll free telephone number will make a quick stop\nA there is an opponent for Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren Jeffs deal and uh does that that that race now need re evaluation by the people of Massachusetts will get to that\nAnd your calls a eight hundred nine four one shown as a number will continue\n[noise]\nThey partying and investigating the stories that mattered\nI ...

continues to\nUse is and what she was trying to do was put this to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it is backfiring on her and I'm Glad to see it because she what she means or do they come out and apologize to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president of the United states are you going to run that I Know I'm not running and I'm not going to run\n\nThe full time US Senator you don't need a part-time author of part time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm Jeff deal the guy who stopped automatic gas tax and now I'm not just not partisan gridlock in Washington that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren same Elizabeth Warren ... officers race from front to back\nMe I call them heroes men and women with their lives on the line every day\nMy campaign isn't about party about getting the job done I'm just prove this\nMessage that is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now till the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren will she does have to get re elected a senator if she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThen tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst than I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nAre the question is I I Know that Massachusetts land solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but the really want or elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible Jeff that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nTo shine great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm you know stop brown one when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when it's not tell you something the Boston determines association has never endorsed a Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist front to that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House in twenty twenty\nHere would you not normally use this amount of money or do this openness and candor is that you\nAnd if you reply that it's you and everything's fine they go away and nothing else happens if you replied that it's not you then they've caught somebody trying to steal your online identity that's when it gets interesting\nThat's when they start trying at that moment they start tracking down where this is happening who might be doing in hopes of catching them\nNow nobody can do that regularly I mean there's nobody that can prevent all identity\nTheft and nobody can monitor every transaction so they have a restoration tape people in this country Americans that do nothing but work with lifelike members who end up being defrauded and they stick with you until everything is resolved\nIt's that simple it's that necessary\nThis kind of crime is something that you're not aware of the moment of happens to you your data is stolen from an online database where you're\nA member you may not know for months or weeks\nThat you have been defrauded lifelike will lifelike dot com\nOr call them eight hundred and forty forty eight thirty three\nUse my name ten percent off and they twenty five dollar Amazon gift card when you use my name eight hundred for forty forty eight thirty three a gym in Pacific palisades California it's a gorgeous place how you doing Jim\nGray Russia are you doing fine thank you\nGod Bless you what you do out there listening to you for twenty five plus years this I just wanted to make a quick point about that whole caravan um\nI think it's a godsend for Trump\nBecause I Believe that Americans like the ones that elected him you know we respect you think about this country fairness and strain and um\nYou know the Capitol hearing was going down before Kavanaugh's show strength and every time Trump shows during the\nGames you games momentum and we spend the military down there as a message and if the military treats everyone with respect a sort of almost like a enhanced FEMA then I think this is going to be a net positive for him and if the Democrats trying to you know\nWhat do you think the Democrats objective with this is with the carbon\nYeah what do you think they're trying to accomplish with it 'cause somebody's behind it somebody's paying for it you know it's a liberal Democrat donors somewhere or a series of them are making ... on\nThe ... I think honestly rush that the Democrats plan is anarchy because they don't have a plan I think they they are just the proverbial party that throws everything against the wall to see what will stick because\nYou remember the or the science fiction film Forbidden Planet\nMm years I rent me where I\nWas like a a a ... a monster that was made of energy that that was conjured up by this man I did was Walter pigeons brain and every time they attack it ruins stripe that absorbed all that energy\nAnd that's basically what Trump is he absorbs all the energy just makes us stronger\nIt makes the people that support him a digging their heels even even further down and it makes president more comfortable and confident because he's\nUsed to being attacked and it doesn't faze him you know and um I just think that the Democrats right now or in a point where they just a in a in a like a a fever and they can't figure out how to get this guy and they're going to throw anything and everything\nI Do I I I'd I'd I Do think that they are seriously folks I don't I'm not saying this to be funny or outrageous to call attention to myself I I really think that in a large swath\nOf your callers are Democrats or to the American left I think there is a creeping insanity\nThat has been building it existed it's been building since Trump won the election it has been building with every failure but they thought was a lock to get rid of him\nThe futility the fact that they're not even slowing him down or harming is driving them crazy because their experiences if they target somebody for destruction that person generally is destroyed\nAnd they can't even didn't ... they were not able to begin with and I think there's\nPsychological disorders and I've been amplified into so called legitimate political issues and I think we're all in danger of these\nPeople still owns awful rash only met\nWhen you put a safe in your home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one brand of safe you should trust to put in your home and that's right ...\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America what it means you it takes skills sweat and talent\nTo produce the most beautiful and secures saves in the world and that's what rhino saves are beautiful creations that help keep your possession secured part art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own riding on metal safe well check out their extensive dealer network on line at rhinos safe dot com veteran owned and veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our age I Am old rhino safe dot com\nThey make the delivery and insulation easy by with peace of mind rhino safe dot com\nNo simple test from Burma sharp objects [laughter]\n\nYou're listening to the Patriot am eleven fifty interview\nWith Sean Hannity denied nine o'clock in the Fox news channel still know feedback your folks from the staff [noise] I Know what are you seeing that there are a lot of quotes from every being weeded out there [noise] ah by Fox and uh and others but\nAnyway that's that we will be back\nTomorrow open mind friday\nSo you know let me ... Fox News America's top diplomat briefing the president today after a fact finding trip Fox is Jared ... live at the White House\nAnd the secretary of state Mike Pompeo jail to President Trump to give Saudi Arabia a few days to finish an investigation into the disappearance of journalists ... to show game\nAnd it never worked out that way for any body and frankly Republicans this was their moment in and look we got rid of the individual mandate\nIn Nineteen days we can create a system of health care second to nobody in the world that's why for seven years I have harassed and bother poor Josh ...\nAtlas MD Wichita, Kansas not only do I put them on radio and TV oh no that's not enough I set up meetings with him he flies to Washington on his own we should pay him\nYou know that I'll probably get accused of something if I offer to pay for something\nUm you know we should fund the effort fifty dollars a month on limited concierge care he did go sheets ... directly with pharmaceuticals Ninety five percent reduction you you need chemotherapy got breast cancer\nWell for a lot of those drugs it's six dollars that treatment\nGood luck getting those prices anywhere we couldn't institutionalized this\nAnyway so there's ... there's not running on what they believe we've learned that with Brett a thin in Tennessee thanks to project beret toss we've learned with Claire McCaskill caught on undercover video she ... they outrageous we needed investigation\nInvestigation into what the fact that you and your own words are saying to the people in Missouri I'm a liar I Am a fake phony fraud I Am a I'm just a phony\nI'm a liar I'm saying whenever I Need to pay to get elected I don't mean any of it my job is to bamboozled the people of Missouri lie to them they can go to Washington and I'm going to govern just like Iraq Obama\nThey can't win a state of mind who they really are they can't win if they give us their true agenda\nThey can't win if they say yeah we really want to impeach Trump impeach forty five and Pete forty five and Pete forty five reclaiming my timer claiming my time they tell Maxine Waters don't say it when I ... I don't\nAbout it just don't say it they tell her and she says they told me not to say it but I'm going to keep saying in any way\nSo their gender is impeachment and lists never ending investigations open borders eliminate ice sanctuary cities now we have a sanctuary state California\nThey want ... why do they want to open borders to they calculated that's going to benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision and every agenda item is about them wanting to hold on to power period\nIt doesn't matter the output uh the the what the end result is doesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well\nThe only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can say they didn't know but that's what they want to take us back\nThat's what they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven\nBy a borderline like tonic hatred of this president\nThey want to go back to what back to Obamacare they weren't open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power for ever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans of people\nAre going to talk about what the president's planning and it's like that's what they stand for\nThis is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs he bought by Medicare open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what name one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better\nBut goes after losing Thirteen million Americans and and having them have to go through food stamps to survive and sustain themselves in eight years of a failed do Tommy of Obama the only president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in American history\nYou know they want to what we don't want to add more people why 'cause they're dependent on them\nThe crumbs they're handing out the irony of that they're ... what what did the leftovers they have\nYou know when they're done building their gyms their Senate gyms their house Kim's there you know house barber shops there Senate barber shops the Senate dining rooms their house dining rooms or they treat themselves well they're not they're not on Obamacare they got to separate out system just for them very different\nSo that's what's at stake you're not going to tell you something about this border as I watch this caravan\nYou've got to understand this is a about national security this is personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years and I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times site antidote you've told us that before\nYeah I've been on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot cabin all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego in many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life floor to ceiling drugs confiscated his where they were headed\nTo Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever\nBut there's now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country is is one the one issue is oh kids go into grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet\nThey try and fight it in a Percocet anoxic on and then they go back to get another one next thing you know they're addicted next thing you know they're buying them on the streets God Knows what those pills really aren't the drug dealers don't give a rip it these kids die\nThen when they find out they can't afford eighty bucks a pill well then some genius idiot friend or dealer friend quote of there's there's one you try heroin does much better ... totally ten dollars a bag\nAnd they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it and they light up in smoke it and then eventually you're going to remain lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave and a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border what's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's called fat and all\nYou don't talk to my buddy Eric Bowley his Nineteen year old son ... bought an than that\nWhich is you know to relieve anxiety and and and it was laced if you have three grains of fat and all the size of three grain of salt it will kill you\nAnd we have nearly a hundred thousand kids dying every single day one death every seven point five minutes you know almost a hundred thousand deaths a year and we keep talking about opioid crisis left and right opioid we can stop it if we secure the border\nCaravans now so I think Newt right I think Kavanaugh what do we see what's happening all\nThe total total elimination of anything that we recognize as the U.S constitution the rule of law equal justice under the law equal application of our laws or the presumption of innocence what presumption of innocence I Believe her never heard from a bribe believer\nThat no corroborating evidence I don't believe her\nYou know but then ... no no no but but they were lined up almost on a weekend basis they wind up in the hall first they spike the punch bowl and after they spike the punch Paul the boys would line up in the hall every weekend and then they rape the girls in the room they take turns and it happened almost every weekend\nAnd then the story evolved into well I didn't see him spike the punch bowl but I saw a mirror punch bowl\nAnd I see I saw him give out a red solo cup\nThat's what that became\nSo and then Dianne Feinstein wants to bring that up again\nAfter eight FBI investigations what are they offering for you because since Trump spent president you got for a million new jobs since Trump's been president four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs jobs that Obama said would never coming back\nSince he's been president we've gotten rid of more regulations than the last five presidents a combined uh he's opened up the entire energy industry of which we have a flawed\nLiterally of natural resources those are going to be career paying jobs high paying jobs for so many millions of Americans are then we've got\nOh the president the grading ISIS nobody thought little rocket man would stop shooting his rockets\nNobody thought that you know being tough on the Iranians would would bear fruit but the Iranians are dying economically because the president leading a boycott and then on top of that what record low unemployment fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace and youth unemployment\nWill do you want to and and the next Nineteen days what ... what what what are they offering you that is better give me the better alternative\n\nWe're all along where you are in beautiful Palm Beach Florida Rush Limbaugh for\nThe hour tonight hope you'll tune in and be watching you know I'm looking at the caravan thinking four thousand people\nFour thousand migrants now thankfully we actually have a president that stands up for the United states of America and thankfully we have a president that they need to know this is not going to fly with me or the American people\nAnd the president is now saying we're going to stop you in your tracks and the president has now poll Mexico and Honduras um excuse me\nUh in the strongest terms I'm asking Mexico doesn't sound like an ask\nAt is stop the onslaught\nIf you're unable to do so I Will call up the U.S military close our southern border\nThen he posted another one continuing to blast Democrats because they're the ones that won't open borders eliminate ice in sanctuary cities and free health care for illegal immigrants course free means you pay for it\nI'm watching the Democratic party led because they weren't open borders and existing week laws assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd whose leaders are doing little to stop the large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico or to the U.S and he said that he will pull aid for these countries\nAnd then he said the assault on our country at the southern border including the criminal elements and drugs pouring in as far more important to me is president then trade and the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada\nHopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border this is all the Democrats fault but week laws that of course they don't want to build the boardwalk guess what it also means it means more drugs\nComing into every small town a big city in this country\nThis should be on your mind and Nineteen days [noise]\n\nLet me ask you a question how long has the medium men telling us it's only a question every time something happens that'll make Donald Trump self destruct it never happens instead\nWe keep watching his critics self destruct Trump's opponents melt down now practically every day over to the fact that Trump isn't melting down they melt down over

crucial\nTo passing you know all the good things that the president's gotten done and the pressure that they put on their leadership and on other senators I mean it's it's a book\nYou know the irony

Waters\nGet a crowd and tell them and follow them into gas stations department stores and and and restaurants and you tell them we don't want to know where ... ... ... now where any point anytime I mean is that the New America because I didn't I don't remember that um [noise]\nWell that's certainly the America will desperate love because they're losing or the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's good I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a meal is street violence a which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because it says Steve ... proved when he was shot um\nYou know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of\nVideotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives and maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg and that is a I ... everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think like I I think he is the fourth\nA cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing of America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage\nAnd they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to Goldwater uh fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American\nPro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy and I think as a result the left\nWhich has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and in the end I think that just further isolates come\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna teach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and that's partly because uh if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there'll be treated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be a magic moment\nIn American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind are Kavanaugh and caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination childish behavior by US Senators in Senate meetings\nI think all that came together to really re galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks\nBecause it makes clear the argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the Feinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody who can get finance\nAnd remember these three thousand people I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people will probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nGuatemala highly four thousand people now grown too amid a spike among a U.S border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just is it seems to be an appendage the Donald Trump's manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but you know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states pasta\nAnd the media is they despise the people I don't think Donald Trump does I think Donald Trump actually could hang or the state fair and be kind of comfortable he says salesmen and the businessmen media's not\nComfortable Glenn Beck program tomorrow morning is on the\nRecord deep in the red [noise] markets taking a hit as more guess withdraw from\nAn economic summit in Saudi

Humvee Rush Limbaugh but the whole hour tonight on the Hannity\nYou know here is the deep state this is the stuff that we put together the puzzle that is now filling in as the house of cards begins to collapse\nNo exactly he's got to come in answer question who else may have been in that room I Will tell you this Maria\nWhen Jim Baker was in his deposition two weeks ago\nAnd was asked about this he was as serious as you can be in describing what he understood took place in that meeting between Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein where Mr Rosenstein talked about actually recording the president of the United states so he needs to come in and answer questions like I said if it takes a subpoena that's exactly what should be a shoo\nSo you you were in a deposition with with James Baker the first one and you're going to end with him this upcoming Thursday what do you want to get from James Baker this week\nWell first of all remember who said this is this is the FBI chief counsel all kinds of things flow through him so when he said that he believe Rod Rosenstein was serious about this this ... this alleged a statement about recording the president\nYou got to take that with the way that it comes with because if the if the FBI chief counsel so we're going to ask you more about that we are our previous deposition was cut off early\nWe go we we ran out of time so we need him back in there we're we're going to have more about that specific meeting that took place and then his conversations with people who were in that meeting\nHow those wins and who all he talked to so the all those things need to be a quick break right back from Palm Beach is Sean Hannity show\n[noise]\n\n\nPrices for peace building all you're not a good windows towards ... attentional business owners rent or at least space including storage space stop wasting your money paying someone else for your space you can save a\nJust like the same information was used to obtain the price of warrants against Carter Page you can't make any of this up for people now say Rod Rosenstein yeah he wanted to wear a wire on the president I'm James Baker is back on the hill today remember he was one of the four people\nThat was very clear about Rod Rosenstein and we're still awaiting the de classification\nOf let's see three oh two gang of eight information Pfizer warrants\nA we're also awaiting you know whether or not we're going to get an redacted Pfizer applications pages ten through twelve seventeenth ... thirty four remember the bulk of information for the size of warrants\nWas the pony never verified never corroborated Russian dot CA that Hillary paid for there's so much it stinks to high heaven John Solomon out with an article yesterday in his article what he's talking about all these FBI topped the oj officials\nThere on all the special interest junk kits\nAnd guess who is probably the most frequent user of the Robert Mueller's pit bull Andrew Weissmann yeah that Andrew Weissmann though one after Paul Manafort that Andrew Weissmann that of course was responsible for tens of thousands of Americans losing their jobs as it relates to Anderson accounting\nWhen you go back years and the Enron investigation\nThe same guy that was overturned nine zero in the U.S Supreme Court\nThe same guy the center for Merrill executives to jail for a year and that got turned over by the Fifth Circuit court of appeals it sounds complicated it really is it is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in the history of the country and I haven't even mentioned\nThe abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence that we give these people\nSupposedly to protect us joining us now a civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown and Carter Page was banned at the center of all of this for the last year and a quarter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back from places like Russia\nOr you would willingly fit the deep briefed ... and and tell them everything you know to help your country out so uh I guess if you are really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled and they needed to Hillary Clinton's unverified phony Russian ... to do it\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the price of course I Would think you'd be indicted right now if you were as bad as they say\nShot it just it it just getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just uh just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting investigation\nAbout things that may have happened a couple of days or or he was within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that is you know people have been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of\nGood government that hopefully uh hopefully the uh the car just starting to fall here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and that I think we're getting into that if you've been a\nA all over in terms of your reporting so\nSo they bring David and David as an attorney in a in a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roles called oversight their job their their check we have a system of separation of powers and checks and balances part of their oversight is when they are investigating the investigators\nThey have been obstructed every step of the way\nRequest document requests we have found instance after instance where they cite national security is a reason for not turning something over only to be turned out to be having nothing to do with national security only an embarrassment to them now we see in in just the last two weeks\nOh Rod Rosenstein who gives an extensive interview to the wall Street Journal here's enough time to testify under oath\nGlenn Simpson is pleading the fifth Nelly or doesn't want to appear and testify under oath James Baker is testifying today and James Baker and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe one other person all saying Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire\nTo go after the president of the United states\nOr if you are representing our friend Carter Page here I mean I Would think you'd have a multitude of lawsuits and the Carter page ought to be a pretty rich man by the end of all of us\nYeah quarter page has a strong base\nThis ... not only information but also damages and relief and is now by the way of course\nConducting some litigation going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example of how very wrong things have gone with the ... the court and otherwise and government you hit the\nProbably the most important point going on here Congress's role in providing oversight um you know God willing congressman Munoz is going to return after this election his work and good last words as vital Congress to no longer bluff though anymore they've got to tell the testimony of these folks\nI think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements\nThat these folks make the American public demands transparency\nAnd they deserve nothing less than transparency and by the way these aren't simple in the states that have gone on you know we talk about this Ninety nine page report on fire\nThe court a abuses that uh and it said director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts and engender by law enforcement officers to invade the law the there is by the way one author or as a new that no one really has exploited yet and that's a fight the quarter of review\nThere is a court that just above the five to where it will also under their rule for consider procedural motions there are three judges to chief justice of when you right now that I just ran us and tell him tell them in different circuits maybe ... maybe that court should be the subject\nOf the uh the ... the forum for a motion to review what's going on to fight the court also just remembering you have in the ... court efforts\nBy the ... where are these buys a court judges a fraud was committed on every one of them they were that run verified uncorroborated information to spy on the guy you're also talking to on this on this line quarter page\nWhy haven't we heard from them yet\nYou're right they should be outraged collie or the judge and the court\nAnd these judges other quarter review it violates their own rules rules Thirteen and it violates the Constitution's and as you pointed out anytime the most sensitive area of our government probably because it's an ex part they application for the most intrusive kind of eavesdropping that there is in the world\nNo you know there was an article by John Solomon I Want to just read a little bit of it to both of you and carnival start with you to get your reaction considering you as\nOf now you appear to be the victim and all of this unless something changes ... Carter Page that I don't know about you are as of now\nHave you with this horrible person that needed to be surveilled\nAnd not just basically a I don't know chink in the armor to get a Trump and then you become the on winning victim in a witch hunt against him but you know because you were light about they use pony information to obtain the warning against you but of all the agencies in the federal government\nSolomon points out that should be immune to special interest schmoozing the D. OJ it's premier law enforcement agencies like the FBI the DEA the bureau\nOf Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives topped the list their independence from influence and their integrity and meaning out the law fairly are essential to their success in the trust\nThe American public puts in them but this week the D. O. j.'s internal watchdog put a rare spotlight on the gratuities inside the department and then he goes on to explain to people in the FBI and the OJ accepting free sporting event tickets\nFrom a TV reporter they don't even give the names of recipients\nHundreds of pages of government ethics filings revealed that in the past three years the deal Jay under Democrat Republican presidents has allowed hundreds of their employees to accept free travel lodging food from special interest across a blow globe and I'm looking at it this\nAnd I'm saying you know really you've got to be kidding me because if anybody else did this that would be called influence peddling and on top of the list we got a guy by the name of Andrew Weissmann new except that apparently more than a dozen free trips your reaction Carter\nSean you know this goes back to sort of the crux of the matter in terms of my case and all the abuses that happened around day it's not about me and it's not about\nAny ah any you know specifics in terms of myself it's really about our country and I think what you see in terms of some of these ah actions that they were doing I'm against the rules and potentially against the law that really reflects you know people just looking out for themselves and yeah it's like President Trump\nAlways said as a candidate or it's not about me it's about us and you know\nWhen they when they come after me they're they're just doing it to ah to get get him at the end of the doubt so that was it's really a a a huge problem\nWill pick it up with the Carter page David show will get his reaction of that on the other side eight hundred nine four one Sean you want to be a part of the program by the way my buddy Steve ... he's going to weigh in at the bottom of this half hour\nWant to remind you look my pillow has changed my life I fall asleep faster I stay asleep longer it just works is these are drug or alcohol induced now my pillows even gotten better because they created the my pillow mattress pop or now\nBetween twenty sixteen and twenty Eighteen all in the U.S\nMaybe not necessarily glamorous locations although Miami can be pretty fun going to Miami we're going to like me have you heard that song\nWill Smith um and that was it a bad junket for him another one in San Diego maybe ... state of the bill Carter NATO but anyway his host range from ...
