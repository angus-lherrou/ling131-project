come down to because the three big cases they won investigated in every case there's no ... operation at all\nNone and and multiple changes in stories\nAt least two of the three cases\nAnd yet this this goes on and this lander and the I mean I just described a story about what Julie sweat Nick was claiming and now she has backtracked\nI don't even know why NBC whatever run an interview like this but they did run it even saying that while she gave U.S foreign names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is\nAnd the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she backtrack center story at what point does the man\nYou know how to Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously re Donovan one saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go off a civil discourse in this country\n... ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump per se and\nAre these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus had the audacity to make all these charges in slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand that independence out and that his doing so with passion indicate\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair is righteous indignation his his to our a rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the vents when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand you digital camera I Would have to have that kind of\nGuy I have always somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response he's supposed to go there is that the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah Pete in apple\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nAh when you're agreed you sleep wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that a\nChristine Blasey Ford was it some time and it some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken for a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this is a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry\nIs to ignore human emotion\nOver ... garden at ... ... and contrast that with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat aspect he was a very much to restrain and I said to myself and robotic if\nHe doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's going to blame them and I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by coaching somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially bleed well she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified in he totally indicated itself it was a mashable ... because I think it was thought that it\nWhat ... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up to Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said was Dianne Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process and then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions\nYou know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when the American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida\nI'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned this\nIt is more important than any you

there are people that how about that story\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall that Julie sweating and another friend she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nBy twenty five down till the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute how does this past for a news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago\nYou would think she can stay consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a a a systemic party culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up outside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that than we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does that how do you where is the news hindered in any capacity here to put this on the air\nByron York is joining us he's been running a lotta columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the goalposts we've come a long

lack of evidence and\nUh there's no way to store if you're ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have been but it was given in part a a due to the news networks I'm praying about Michael I haven't had any her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think it was a parent to a lot of people are there was nothing to this story\nUm and when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gotten the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in her case um was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWill the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling

judge Kavanaugh's accuser\nDr forwards attorneys are complaining they still haven't been contacted by the bureau seeing in a letter to the FBI it is inconceivable that the FBI could conduct a thorough investigation of a doctor for a delegation without interviewing her judge Kavanaugh or the witnesses we have identified in our letters to you\nBlock says Guerra tell your doctor Ford's attorney also calling President Trump while and vicious or seemingly mocking her inability to remember the details of the night thirty six years ago but she says judge Kevin I'll Try to take advantage of\nI made that viral moment of Lindsey Graham literally just shook the entire hearing as it relates to judge Kavanaugh\nAnd Senator Graham of South Carolina joins us right now he's on the Senate Judiciary committee a senator good to talk to you thank you for joining us there's a lot going on Mitch McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished\nAnd we will have a vote on Kavanaugh and uh I assume it's going to happen at some point this week do we have any any timetable idea\n... I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct as so here with the agreement or with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like risk but he was never part of the ... what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no he's\nAsking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and Mr ... and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week\nI think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and safe is changed anything I Hope we don't move the goal post Jeff voted yes in committee with the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to know the FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throwing I says like a good day in a bar so uh the bottom line is that saw a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace\nA Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... that there are any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff lakes going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is gonna do yeah uh they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but we're supposed to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize\nThe way he was treated if the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with our senator\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain well\nI mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump strike they've already against score six\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... for its claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're wanting to FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota\nWants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have\nAnd I'll action appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to these red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh\nSo you mean you're you're communicating hand I don't I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that I\nDoubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process but it's in this is that the teacher the judiciary the states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know\nIt's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of these states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to

I saw him near the punch bowl and he was giving out red solo cups too people\nThat's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens ... regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a pair\nAnd that this was happening or this happened or their drug in kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nIn police documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a

mean part of LA are about how he behaves finance truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration released late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel and ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath to last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the forward\nNeither mentioned ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman\nI had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office\nAny further claimed afford never voice any\nFear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot

corroborate her story none of them can corroborate her story most don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault\nSaid it didn't happen so at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent you don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement\nAnd assuming that the for people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions and if they did then okay\nThat would be a pretty big deal there is no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but I mean professor Ford is now told their story multiple times and I've got to believe and assume\nThat they're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said it last week before the Senate Judiciary committee um you know it's just I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means because what it means matters\nYou know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter\nLindsey Graham is saying Clinton sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor for it and I I think the the Republicans held the actually did something well I think they

who's going to vote yes and who's going to vote no because we have one party that in every single case even though there's no core operation\nEven though facts on the ground continue to shift didn't

seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about raw power\nA fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for Kevin all your complicit with evil such\nRaw power are the kinds of smearing dishonest questions and accusations that we've seen that raw power and\nThat is what this election is about this election will decide what kind of country we are\nTo how how many

asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican

their constituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana\nMissouri because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he

I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself\nI mean they were just radically out of out wild and that happens all the time and these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then did not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general is a California She's supposed to know due process\nShe released an anonymous chain do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh of committing some lurid sex acts\nIs there no to corn left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweat neck in particular that if in fact she you know she made these statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this\nI Know that we have now examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview but they are today anyway the\nEyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nWell I think um what has to happen who's truly sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs\nNeeds to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitted false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot\nSimply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that miss what may\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate issue for her story there is no substitute education permits Ramirez story and I just want to say something that I Know\nAre probably throwing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied like her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to you may be Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise I remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist the resistor as a lawyer this is separate hatched ever catch by the way who said well Paula Jones only spend ten or twelve minutes\nWith with Bill Clinton and it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the case of al\nFranken but I I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well ... I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional rules\nI I'm a I'm a very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that I can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases\nHere's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety now why is her story not include her going to those people\nBecause if she had done that if she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered it in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know 'cause we're talking about the we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think for the Republicans credit they took these allegations and charges seriously they handled it professionally therefore that every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats are they just they just now have pushed this so far\nInto it it ... into any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nOh I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act or react I Would assume was probably\nPeople react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is non existent their data is harder than happen that just doesn't happen Sean\nLet me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they they're which music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned that music up so nobody could hear her\nAnd then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what you think these guys just turn the music ups and no one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down I mean there are so many flaws in what she said\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with Victoria Toensing Joe diGenova next and then your calls coming up final half hour we'll just do all calls eight hundred nine four one Sean\nHey listen if you have sunspots well our friends at Shawnee engineer so they came out with their brand new product it's there's sunspot correct or now it's everybody's go to products especially after summer it gets rid of sunspots aged ...\nYou're going to see a difference guaranteed of course or you get your money back and you could literally watch sunspots age spots red inflamed patches banished right before your eyes\nOf view just love crap needs to stop [noise] there's nothing the love that Kim Jong il Graham\nSpeaking of the Atlantic festival says he's worried North Korea is dividing the U.S from South Korea a long time ally and American security firms as North Korea has stolen hundreds of millions of dollars by hacking worldwide banking computer systems North Korea is denying any involvement\nFox News we report due to side\n[noise]\nNow traffic on the Patriot am eleven fifty\nAlmost seven ten freeway cellphone near Alondra Boulevard a big rig involving accident much earlier the right wing shut down for a long time ... you know the fact that during that time ... ...\nJust got word from she used to be the right man it's reopened the singular ticking down traveling however still stop and go from one of five isn't\nJust cleared out of the way in rows me ten freeway each ... avenue an accident number one lean left side in Torrance ...

the where the alleged ... events took place\nMisconduct allegations et cetera et cetera\nUm remember no corroborating evidence no location there is no forensic evidence there is no one the backs up or
