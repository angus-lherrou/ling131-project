waking me up all night my snoring was pretty bad we were desperate for a solution and we finally found it was a quiet it literally changed our lives\nThe choir we wake up rested and happy and best of all in the same university\nApparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this if you want to predict and it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida it was a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab rush loser but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know Ron dissent this about a great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax the Gillum would support\nGillum as we use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views he's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected\nBy being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for we saw that with British citizen the project berets as tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida we've got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason Brett is it is out there trying to convince the people to Tennessee that he is something that he's not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office\nAnd saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing and the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on to an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets what's so Harvey tour with with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate ice ... open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we pay the criminal justice cause if you go to a house\nBut all hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we\nPay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront at the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states all wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry\nI mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone\nVictims of crimes some very serious including murder\nAnd then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're gonna play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory of coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year a and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or a evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half hour we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away it looks like it's going to be Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that we've\nGot her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo that we have ... Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about ... the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs of the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom for as it was still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Iran dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee\nMartha Black um ... Marshall mixed Martha McSally wins in Arizona where we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly the problem for the Republican Braun in\nState of Indiana is well in his particular case she's got a libertarian in the race and that means that the libertarian siphoning votes away from the Republican Ron Mike Braun is now claiming that you know a Brett Kavanaugh search citing internal polling is now has in leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this an app to all of this this is an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is that an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nMean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and then we had four thousand people around there a moment at a huge crowd in Houston as well\nWe're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got to force the hypocrisy so we got\nThe cabin on your shoe you got the caravan coming you got more mobs over the weekend confronting and and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country you've got now two years of magnificent success record breaking jobs and opportunities for Americans\nIt's where you have more safety and security are stronger president versus eight years of failure so we have a choice in this election\nFrom redirect of marketing company went from qualified policies [noise] [noise]\n\nWe ever afford out that the caravan has now grown according to the Washington Times fourteen thousand illegal immigrants marching towards our southern border the president just spoke\nOut about it with a play some of what he said at the bottom of this half hour out if those reports are all accurate it's a whole lot bigger than previously reported and growing\nAnd what you have is members of the caravan chanting guess we could as they're making their way through Mexico all day to day I've been defied the will of one country vowing to test the spine of another\nMexican police who failed to stop them at the country's border with Guatemala\nNow service that sports that appears for the care of on as they know battling north\nAs members clear that they have no intention of staying in Mexico Leah buys for the U.S new estimates cited by L. universal which is a Mexican newspapers say the Caribbean now has fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others do wait\nOh that would put them in the category of illegal immigrants not an asylum seekers because you're seeking asylum you have to seek it in the country that you first appearance but they appear confident that\nThis confrontation is going to come down to this is this is extraordinarily dangerous for the country here but I Am telling you\nPolitically the American people fundamental is white Kavanaugh matter they believe in the in the core values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the\nAnd Americans in stink to believe don't like the idea that people think they can march right across the border into our country we don't know who they are we don't know where they came from in some cases most cases we don't know what their intentions are\nOther president has already said we're going to begin cutting off substantially or substantially reducing foreign aid or Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd he says every time you see people illegally coming are attempting to come into the country blame the Democrats for not giving us the boats to change our pathetic laws and that would mean building the wall that he wanted to build that we can get done\nOr the president just spoke out about this will play it when we come back with a lot to get to more than ... much more

invasion\nThe American people I Know the Democrats they're thinking this is their moment this is good for them I don't I don't see how any of this is good for the\nDaily Caller has a piece out saying that the majority of people in the care of on not ... that are headed to the borders are not as is being reported families including women and children\nAbout instead they're quoting multiple reports

what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping the caravan ... make their way to our southern border\nPresident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally that is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give to them\nBut the president also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty they're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies\nThat allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this

the Bangladeshis were detained and an immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after their detention the borders and Central America not as strong as the U. S. which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nA said Anna on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country\nAnd yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly [noise] um so you've got the care of and continuing their march now a couple of other things that you've got to understand here and\nThere is a political thing having been to the border everywhere from the Rio Grande the San Diego\nHelicopter horseback boats all terrain vehicles you foot I'd been out there I've seen even gang members arrested right in front of me while I was there saw it in the entire family from El Salvador arrested right in front of me\nUh I've been to the drug warehouses which I played it many times I've seen the tunnels that have that have been dug\nThis is not just I mean this is the biggest rushed we've had but on top of it and maybe they think the Gavin Newsom is going to win and they can all go to the sanctuary state of California and there'll be safe and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom is promising every Californian legal not legal wherever you come from free health care free free free\nI think\nThat's a long time you said they want a month for a long time there's no reason for that by\nLooking at it we have a lot of different ah\nConcepts right now are they have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now you know that as well as I Do I look at it very seriously\nProtecting everybody you know what I'm doing I'm protecting everybody I Want to protect our country\nBoy that he has I think it's going to be I think they really wanted to see that I'm On a ... am a hundred percent ... uh we have I mean you've been reporting over a hundred thousand people\nThey lined up two days ago and it's very exciting when there is one thing that will be a big factor that I got to get up really going to make a great speech I'm going to get up I'm going to make a great speech I Hope our votes do you go and you're not going I Can't believe it you're not going to be there 'cause I\nI think\nThat overall is highly overrated a what I heard about him I figured you must be something a little ... not ...

National Guard in order to make sure\nThat we saw what happened last friday in Mexico at their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now a ... it's almost like we're headed towards a major\nHuman confrontation here people that don't affect our laws and sovereignty and the president saying you must respect our laws and sovereignty um no I I think Democrats in the back of their heads hoping this happens so all maybe something bad will happen and Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you you'd never know I Hope I Hope not I pray not\nYeah same here but I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady comment is that the Republican events Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said I'm In I'm sick of this kind of stopped she gives it the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted to start her goals and dreams in this great nation\nThat's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of things happen and the and the possible political implications\nAnd motivations behind

district that has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking\nBut that's a hand you're dealt and ah anyway a congressman Scott Perry is with us She's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting doesn't they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have out this week that they want it to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it or to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you kind of highlighted some of the things are doing of course the big thing they're doing which they're not just doing it to be you know and talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nUh it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd

own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover is ... brand new book\nUh and it's but nominal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans had won the presidency you know those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they liked the way judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so ... what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that insect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the light in the vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get to the NHL as\nShe's less of a Native American than you or me into the vapors Asian big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next day secret okay me too movement seems to work there's no due process and the meat you know\nLet's take this guy that did very well credential judge\nOh he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predict it so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate\nAnd it couldn't happen without the energy and the for the tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say let's see if he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what I feel like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blamed the Democrats were not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be a sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary built for even one set of any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your order because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get a you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days model a lotta left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw such um ... well could there answered\nBy so why don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ... percent of the society shutting the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months that as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving the lower middle class families shot it now to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons so it was either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get on each call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put it in President he was gay he resonates with these people for\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that has not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any kids that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspirations\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is it you cannot system the ties or through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which is really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she does all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction\nIs that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left\nEither ... the Democratic party it used to I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nIf you're losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses\nIt's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think of as Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but it's about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the market yeah\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is one of those Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs and factory jobs are and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nAnd listen we're all big supporters here on the Sean Hannity showed the second amendment also responsible gun owners that's why we're friends with the USCC ate a given away a free gun every day twenty four days\nShowing up to collect rent with these twenty six year old son Donald Trump in and they're walking through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors Carl want a family cannot pay the rent the father has lost the job he's a blue collar worker Fred and it's sort of looking at him saying okay no problem\nAre very often guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job low and behold a short days later a he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed a and it's just a wonderful story semi never\nGoing to be told by the mainstream media on both people talk about what does the president has compassion for these people does the president at the apathy and the answer is yes she learnt that at the riding shotgun with his father\nWas he was either building these buildings helping to build buildings are collecting rent for blue collar people that were living shot so so I wanted I did a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story or a couple of Trump's family which is a great American success many ways the added he family is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh put their ... part of America the hardest fabric of America\nYou know the the generations that built this country and energy of Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations I built this country are just amazing people the immigrants of built this country by grandparents all for coming from Ireland\nUh anyway the book is called the Trump the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci it's up on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere Anthony good to see we're going to see on TV this week we'll look forward to it my friend and all the best when your book tour and I hope people will run out and get a

Minnesota Public radio star Tribune Minnesota pole\nAnd it's now forty three thirty six in that particular race and um what's fascinating about this is I didn't\nYou know all the people that wanted all the investigations into judge Kavanaugh based on you know guilt by accusation no due process no presumption of innocence word from any of the\nNo ... no Dianne Feinstein or no Corey Spartacus Booker and no Kamala Harris fascinating Kamala Harris Wu's Iowa\nI you know what I see they're trying to turn to mellow or Cory into the the next Obama next savior of the Democratic party the next anointed one it just dying to find the right person OK well given your best shot at the bottom line is if they really cared about the issue was they said they did\nWell then Cory Booker would be under investigation because those allegations made about an assault this weekend about am\nNever mind what he had already admitted he did on his own on top of Keith Ellison would have been investigated not one of the these Democrats call for an investigation\nI don't know if any of it is true the person that seems the most credible here is this woman Monaghan who recently data Keith Ellison it was his girlfriend\nShe's got tapes and and doctors' notes and and uh apparently some maybe even video of him a verbally physically emotionally abusing this woman\nUh people of Minnesota are paying attention\nIf not you know all these hypocrites on the Senate Judiciary committee\nOr the wave our friend Dana Rohrabacher Southern California it's six congressional races that are going to play a big part in the balance of power come November two weeks from now and then come January\nDana Rohrabacher apparently was tied but now it's taken a lead and in his important seat which is California's forty eighth congressional district\nIs a friend of the program and ah that that's just the tight race\nUm anecdotally are not paying a lot of attention to it but then BBC News is reporting of early voting results are any indication we may be seeing a bigger\nRepublican turnout than anybody anticipated oh jeez oppose might be wrong again I just don't trust these polls\nI don't trust these people that make their predictions\nYou know I follow I I look at it I factor it into what my thinking is\nI actually think that we should act right now that every race every Republican is behind\nAnd know that if the Democrat wins for the house that that's a vote for ... staying home is a half a vote for below sea and in every important Senate race be at Florida\nOr be a Tennessee or be Missouri or bit Nevada or be at Arizona or Montana or North Dakota or New Jersey even or Indiana that they're all winnable\nYou know there's no scenario would unfold one week two weeks from tonight that I could be surprised that\nBut I Would like to shock the world again I Would like you to shock the world again and you have the power to do it well yeah but not ... not having a good week apparently lost the

I Know that we're watching but as you know anywhere between seven and a fourteen thousand and growing in this caravan Washington Examiner rightly points out there's been over five hundred and Twenty one thousand people apprehended at America's\nSouthern border and other ports of entry from October first twenty Seventeen through September thirtieth twenty Eighteen half of them over half a million people build the wall Sarah Carter\nIs a reporting visited the gate would a gateway pundit\nYou know that um apparently Guatemalan intelligence she says I've discovered people from India Bangladesh Africa also joined the caravan and I bumped into a number of MS Thirteen gang members\nJudicial watches Chris feral and while I'm On secretary a strategic intelligence we're on the border with me\nSo you know we'll follow that report the president of Guatemala confirms according to CNN the caravan has been infiltrated by ISIS there's all day the fake news media does this CNN fake news by the way\nCNN is saying that ISIS reports them from ah the president of Guatemala no one has really mentioned this\nAnyway the report stemmed from an October eleventh article on a prominent ... mile and a newspaper which quoted the Guatemalan president saying the country's law enforcement of captured a hundred people linked to terrorism including ISIS\nAnd morale is the President Jimmy Morales Guatemala said during his speech that we have not only detain them within our territory but they had been deported\nTo their country of origin judicial watch picked up that headline\nAgain you know the one that I I Can't say I'm not there and I'm not interview about say this nobody can vouch for any of the\nThousands of people in the care of him we don't know and that then represents a clear and present danger to the United states I'm assuming most of poor people that see America as the land of milk and honey and they want a better life for themselves and their families that's what I'm predicting most of them are Ninety nine percent\nBut that one percent we we can't vet we don't know that's why we can't have open borders\nAnd we couldn't have many way 'cause we are kind of mean we've already paid billions for educational cost health care costs um this is literally like an invasion\nIf they get through our southern border we're going to protect our border and people on the other side of the border of Mexico would precipitate some type of confrontation people get hurt if we had a wall we wouldn't have that problem\nGetting a little scary out there we don't want that we don't want anybody getting hurt here\nAnyway you know by the way somebody wrote me do you think four thousand Honduran suddenly just decided to march thirty five hundred miles towards our border right before the midterms with cameraman and you don't think it's staged and you're not paying attention I\nListen doesn't at this point even matter just there's something we have to do when the when did

passionately that we should simply provide those were illegal we would legal status or at least ignore the laws on the books and put them into deportation until\nWe have better loss but I Believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both on wives and unfair it was suggested that I was thinking about coming here legally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision and this could lead

nation's great comeback us Newt Gingrich is with us or how are you\nI'm I'm doing great and I'm and Omaha today for the Republican Party of Nebraska and I you know I'm very very optimistic about how this election is shaping up\nWell I'm Glad you there do me a favor I think uh one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life in terms of supporting somebody of disappoints is a guy by the name of Ben Sasse Ben Sasse had his way\nHillary Clinton would have been at the president the last two years she would have made the two Supreme Court appointments none of the bureau bureaucracy would have been removed we'd have open borders we would have Obamacare on steroids\nUm but he was never Trump her now is blasting made a new book trying to get me to talk about it so that he can sell copies when he hasn't passed a single piece of legislation with his own name on it alone that he sponsored\nSorry it's personal point\n[laughter] get that's personal but you know the fact is\nThe never Trump or his are a fossilized group that are less and less relevant I mean it was every passing month the president's support from the Republican Party goes up or I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas um [noise]\nI don't know anybody in American history who attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nI was just an astonishing achievement and I think it bodes very well ah for the impact that he's going to have on both this year's election and on killing two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know there it by foot they make it in what\nThree weeks three and a half weeks but one thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice\nBut to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land and I wear a nation of laws\nAnd I don't ... and in the process the people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right\nIs that better so so now you understand psychologically what Abraham Lincoln went through between Eighteen fifty eight\nAnd a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight this ... this was you know you aren't going to choose\nSaid I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great chest that President Trump is going to face because\nHe he I mean yeah I talked to about a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt he feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning says it hit me this morning the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices then you can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them in northern Mexico and if you ask yourself with this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position ought to be a that Mexico that decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they returned back to the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept the I'm In a City College done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he deemed should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend this decision you just have to say I did this to be unacceptable for national security reasons and that block\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're gonna have to step in here somehow in turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know\nBut the reality is either by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in in Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua\nOr that they want a better life but this is not the way to do we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border\nAnd my fear is if they get to the border that we could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for them if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nRight but the number in the near future the next few weeks our policy should be\nTo hope for the best foot plan for the worst I think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans ended up with their own political reasons doing nothing they decide that they expect Donald Trump to cave and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people's wants to uh enter the United states what\nDid they haven't thought through is what if he doesn't have what if he does call out to the military what if we do in fact create are in effect human wall and block people from entering the United states now and then I have what what could be but then as much as ten or Fifteen thousand people because of their ass keep growing\nWell there was one report yesterday from a newspaper in Mexico that said it's already ballooned up to fourteen thousand\nRight so so part of what I'm saying\nAnd if we're going to have them and we're in agreement about religion [noise] those are the big

everything um I I Would be one of those people that sort of shows up at Christmas and Easter your church\nUh and I don't go to church that much but uh but I Believe all of us and ah and both of you

I say feel with him we got him myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response would go viral [laughter]\n\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself how would I have always said that has a man of the ... that's why we have a fear I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the old me would come out if I'm with my wife told me it would come

maybe the martial arts and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to stop crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk I Will do everything I can do to walk like\nI Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or outright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're\nGoing to react like that's just not then they're going to get pissed and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people\nOn Twitter ... and our other interaction but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nI look I don't know why are we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life but\nThey're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success fourteen state record states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace\nOur vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly decided to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others that say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady and so you know they said well we don't like that some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you've got to say that I have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWell the predator didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus by night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just rent cream tell them as much as ... in the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really good\nFor would do it with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN MSNBC that's starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the ... the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this\nDay but if if we all believe in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes the the word education from the Latin isn't due to bring forth from within\nThat tells you the God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people\nAnd that's what I see Trump's doing and it and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get back what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again he needs to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we have an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the leftist authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics\nDividing people on the basis of race and gender is\nEvery four to them for years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white or read that book as a racist or sexist massage in this

We're gonna come close we don't want to ask me to keep it and I think as the pastor Scott ... said\nWell there's so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around the Trump expand that opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black\nAnd I'm telling ya liberals can't stand this Kanye and the other people who were defecting from their

humanity\nYes it is I really believe next fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging as long as I mentioned in states consistent also I think that you know there's a script in the Bible says this is no weapon formed against these shell prosper I Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation\nI'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back
