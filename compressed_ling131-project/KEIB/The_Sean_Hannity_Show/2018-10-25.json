mobs in the case as I was talking about you know let through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs\nThat had been sent to Obama in the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive been putting his mailbox and\nI listen what did I say about George Soros yesterday like they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that would love the show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on almost I you could see this building and building and build\nAnd building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse you got to clear the halls you can't let these activists\nKnow getting in the faces fitting it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue but there's it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video and Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bangs on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then start screaming at the top of his lungs and then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nI didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activist they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a nationalist\nAnd his policies are the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they weren't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where\nPeople are dying now you have a few famous people that have had these suspicious packages that had been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I have been saying this is not\nGoing to end well somebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nIt ought not be prices precipitated at the border but there's Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe bomb suspicious\nPackages sent to the Clintons home in chapel claw similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\nAnd ... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros is home in Westchester New York suspicious Pakistan to Debbie Wasserman Schultz was officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder kick them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant in department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore and watching it happened to all these Republicans does any of this\nYou know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um you know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had similar incidences of security in my life\nYou know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl that worked for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news and she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation\nBecause we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that but it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with reports suspicious packages and\nKnow that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder is another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skull east nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations that barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin hurt the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people\nI I never saw such heroism it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing in the build up to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nThis isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that skill leases shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say see I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite\nI don't know I eat can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters he's not responsible for that but the media today and their their reaction to this is so over the top so outrageous so disgusting leap partisan it just they're so quick to blame\nI've been through all of it I've had you know I mean I Do I Do I Begin to tell the story about poor release I Want to live off shoes quarantine for hours it was like nine hours was horrible horrible and somehow we got no liberal media coverage\nYou know I look at it it's not about the coverage because you know but look we just had three weeks ago three weeks ago\nWe had rice and sent to Trump mad as re Haspel\nI don't remember any coverage now in the case of any of this there were lunatics I'm going to prove that we get back that I'd been consistent and I'm also going to prove what you're hearing today from liberal politicians about civility is they're just words because their silence\nIn the last month over the most serious issues of their supporters has been definitely will get to that and what Thirteen Days away from the most important election mid term in our lifetimes [noise]\n...\n... talk to you as you know as president is to keep America safe president\nTrump tells a rally in Wisconsin and us we'll find whoever sent the pipe bombs former CIA director John Brennan the target of one of the packages blame the president for the political climate\nOr Trump too often has helped to incite a some of these feelings of anger violence um when he points to acts of

top of the hour Thirteen Days till the all important midterm elections and of course our top story today and we have other issues we're going to get too including Newt tape that has been a shot undercover that really exposes\nHeidi Heitkamp in North Dakota literally the ... she's quote she'll be a super liberal every elected [noise] that's what they're caught saying on tape\nYou know she's she'd be bolder if she was reelected and everything else just like Brett ascending tendency just like\nClaire McCaskill in Missouri now we got Heidi Heitkamp acting one way before an election and trying to bamboozled the people in the states I'm you know it's uh\nWhat other things that I Am I I'm not surprised that but it 'cause it's all too predictable and that is this rush to judgment now that we have these the what looks like suspicious packages some\nPowder maybe pipe bombs all of this was going to be vetted out in the days to come the president has reacted very strongly today let off an opioid bill signing event at the White House\nAnd he was with the vice president he retweeted the vice president's comments on the emergency and condemning the bomb like incidents and online statements as media outlets left wing politicians you know around the country we've got to protect our politicians\nThey getting suspicious packages in the mail um\nWe know that is this happen to Donald Trump's family we know recently happened to Don junior and his family we know that it has happened just rice and letters were sent to Trump and Madison ray and Haspel just three weeks ago and I frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIt Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is probably you know some fringe person out there somewhere\nOr it could very well be in and obviously the temperatures been hot as we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nStop confronting people like Pam Bondi stopped confronting Henry Kissinger stopped throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy\nMay have been watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very scary thing for anybody to have to live through\nUm what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement I mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD they have their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incident so far at all we don't know if they're alive we'll get updates from sure throughout\nThe day now the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act so strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest an absolute priority so the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we will spare no resources or expense in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts\nOr threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd he concluded by touting his statement\nCondemning they agree just threats that cetera et cetera and and mores coming\nBut that's not what you got the media writer almost instantaneously\nAlmost instantaneously some NBC News reporter named Ben Collins Soros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio and Fox\nNews for over a decade when he just said Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush the job we don't know who did it we have no nobody has a clue who did this what I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative\nOr Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBut it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe what they want to believe because they want the political narrative what's so hypocritical the same people that have been tone deaf and failing to what has been unfolding now in this country for a month\nKeep your hands to yourself and uh you know and keep it in and leave people if they're in public alone or at least leave the women ... percent Pam Bondi alone and secretary Nielsen and Sarah Sanders and our kids alone if Ted Cruz's out with his wife can you leave them alone leave his wife alone\nYou want to if I'm

insanity that's been breaking out around the country and we've been playing the rhetoric Corey Spartacus\nBook or get in their face Hillary Clinton you can't be civil Eric Holder kick them Maxine Waters repeatedly you know create a crowd confront them in restaurants department stores gas stations and I want it anywhere anymore and now today the\nMedia as quick as well it's talk Radio's fault it's Fox News's Paul this is Trump's fault no it would be you know the rhetoric on the left and all these incidents on or you're a single person speak out ever\nWe you know here's a fact nobody right now knows anything about who's responsible for and whether or not these are actual bombs that's not even been confirmed yet but they're meant to look like bombs maybe the white powder was meant to look like\nRice and or or some type of other you know poison we don't know yet we knew we knew know three weeks ago rice and letters were sent to President Trump secretary of defense Mattis\nFBI Director re CIA director Gina Haspel that we know anyway former NYPD Commissioner a Bernie ... book by the way is phenomenal\nThe grave above the grave commissioner of the police department of New York I call him ...\nA dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent his best selling book is out now it's called Spygate welcome both of you to the program today the president condemning whoever is responsible for sending these items and even then he's getting criticized you know you would think listening to the media that it was him who sent them\nAnd meanwhile they've been silent with all these public confrontations Bernie look\nI've lived in New York a long time um it's been a while I don't get mail anymore but I've had the white powder scare I had a an assistant a mind quarantine for about nine hours while they were testing out whether anthrax spores were in the package it turned out thankfully that was not the case\nSaw that a lot after nine eleven\nYou know was shown it just kind of reminds me of that because the after nine eleven I think it was the first month anniversary a after nine eleven\nWe actually got anthrax or at city hall\nWe got it a ... she NBC I remember getting a call from Tom Brokaw cause producers I'm In and this is what that reminds me of however uh people have to keep in mind right now we don't know if these packages these devices are real\nUm we don't know who sent them what the purpose was um we're going to hear about a lot of false alarms in the next two days perhaps\nUm but I Would in in I think Dan may agree with me here [noise] I Would predict given that they found these devices and and they got them without that they have\nA I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days\nWhat makes you think that Bernie [noise] well ... when you get an eight to stuff or you know you blow to pieces it's harder\nTo collect the evidence that you could send to a ... a machine right so now you have a package itself or the mail or the the stamps though writing the device looms side they're going to break this stuff down\nWherever how long it took to find the Unabomber I remember that case\nYeah but you know what Sean times are different times of different technologies get for new mailing list of those different areas and there's so many packages loose who's a this is a benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like the ... gene okay it's going to Democrats it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be right off the top of their head that first suspect would be well might be some\nRadical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nNo and and there's\nA lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one is set devices are now we don't want to get a straight face acceptable in polite conversation incentive vices violence on public officials and anyone who does um\nIs a moron and Savage I think there's a period full stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber he was a little more tactically of strategically devious he would send those bombs and there'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually develop\nA new kind of a you know let's say ways to put those in construct those bombs together is very difficult with this\nThey're basically you know ... ... nations whoever this was you may have done this so it's got to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices\nAny clues but there's a part of me that believes Sean that this person or persons I'm wanting to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish on I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices to CNN was addressed that John Brennan\nWho does it work at the end I mean it's hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you could figure out that John Brennan and that you know and it'd be the comet he's not a CNN\nHistory of this is just basic stuff I mean think about it if you were ... enough of the Savage at an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility you think you do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it um from my experience in this this is amateurish as well and you know I\nAhead Greg real quick oh hey Sean great catch to listen to the big big honor um I was blessed enough to go to the rally\nOut here in Houston and it was just amazing to hear President Trump speaking person I was skinny so much hope because my sister brought my little nephew and a Thirteen year old kid hung on every single word that a President Trump had to say and

... it's a very\nRepublican I had it was the other hand you know the\nPenal don't walk\n\nAround like the ... the\n[noise] I mean there wasn't actually\nYeah this is the same thing with ah with Claire\nMcCaskill enemy and now we're just trying to do [noise] you know because it makes people fall out here\nSo don't say she I supported the wall just like the fact that or\nWhatever like on the ground saying\nOkay because I just add there's something or yeah or like making people got she got some support the wall and the other day I don't know but I still don't say that she doesn't want them to kind of ... people don't really understand this is my head on\nGoing to get me a while\nThis is\nThe wall or whoa whoa whoa\nWhoa\nWhoa she's do vote against the wall [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd then we have this\nOne in the [noise]\nThey didn't want to be like you know\nThe amazing this is now number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election\nAnyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are\nYou [laughter] hey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director in her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in the battleground states elected\nWhat's so amazing is that consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people at Penn as the ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for the state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama\nAnd the ... will have the same using everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those uh Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff is saying so it's more it's basically the same thing and each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to moderate voters and play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be settled liberate once you get selected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again\nSo because this what Jesse Overton says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people in their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that that's what we do it very tossed we confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really a left or right thing I was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it may I suggest have integrity\nThis is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to woo the moderates and that and they could only make one choice\nOnce but he's not a good choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there was an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well Dave\nThough it's so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill asked to be a special prosecutor\nInvestigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone no and it it it's her to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're east Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it\nBut thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something else Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks\nThen how wrong is that for them to mislead the voters if it's it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to miss represent in such a awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that and asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station in Missouri every single one has covered these videos

but we do have a number of other states next week I I I'm Wondering if I should say the names of the states I don't know\nI think yeah I I think you should give it a little man I\nI you know we've got

tune in James O'Neill is the New York police department commissioner giving an update on the bomb investigation here's what he's saying\nHe's suspicious package investigations are conducting here in New York City\nAnd foremost my message today is that New Yorkers are safe\nThere are no current credible threats twenty individuals organizations or locations here in New York City\nNew Yorkers are safe but everyone all eight point six million residents and the millions of visitors who come here every year should always remain vigilant\nAnd aware of their surroundings as always I urge people to alert us to anything that might seem strange route to place or anything that makes them feel uncomfortable they fled got a cop call nine one one or coal or a toll free counterterrorism number which is one eight eight eight New York city safe\nAnd that's where anything new or if someone as information about any of the instruments this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make George our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as they do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind of nothing we do in law enforcement we do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision and I can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\n[noise] New York city's intelligence and counterterrorism kind of terrorism capabilities are second it on every day they are not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over the threat stream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're seeing that today too out of an abundance of caution hotel you that when we look at the events of yesterday and today I have a match pride in incredible work the men and women are the NYPD do each and every day especially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today\nAll concluded by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about\nKeeping the public to serve safe that's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe and through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works in and visit New York city who make the safest large city the United states even safer Mr Mayor ... referred

thankfully none exploded no one was injured\nAnd this full scale federal local investigation is to hunt down wherever those maniac is that would be responsible for such things you know it is um I don't care who it is\nYou know there is no place in this society for this type of violence these types of threats this intimidation it should have no place in politics or country you know this is\nEvil ... we're talking about and I wanted act of terrorism here it's a having lived through some of this myself I Know how horrible it is my thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that is involved in this it's just wrong I Want these guys put in jail for as long as possible\nAnd they shouldn't they should not have to be said no conservative I Know what ever\nSupport this horrible act or this type of violence depravity as a president condemn that yesterday um nobody knows who's responsible yet everyone's rushing to judgment like they usually do when they can\nPoliticize something you know is this has now been unfolding you you watch people assigning blame or to all political rivals especially President Trump and they go to Fox News then talk radio and it goes on from there\nMeanwhile we have heard the play some of it in the last hour plays some a bit later in the program today that most incendiary over the top out of control statements that have now been going on for weeks and weeks\nThese mobs literally showing up getting in the faces taking the marching orders of Spartacus and people like Maxine Waters that created a crowd and follow them into department stores gas stations grocery stores you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nClaire McCaskill also caught on tape saying I'm just like Obama I'm just I'm just saying these things to get elected um she doesn't care about raining in or or representing the people of Missouri\nYou know you've got another Daily Caller report\nTalks about non exploding bombs turned up yesterday and today the New York times those has no reason to seemingly to apologize but the Trump assassination fantasy that they published the day before the\nPipe bomb was discovered the first one\nTimes published a story short story about assassinating president Donald Trump on Tuesday one day before potential explosive devices showed up at the addresses of all these political figures New York times are asking novelist to conjure up possible outcomes to Robert Mueller's investigation\nThey don't care only care about Russia collusion as long as it's a Republican only care about sexual misconduct or salt if it's a Republican they ignore Ellison Spartacus Clinton they only care about incendiary language when they think it comes from a conservative not their own\nBy the way Charles Grassley is issued a criminal referrals for ... and Julie sweat neck remember she was the woman that made the accusation\nOh that almost on a weekend basis they would they would spike the punch bowl and boys would line up in the

criminal investigation into the potential they made false statements to Congress\nAbout time somebody follows up Chelsea Clinton saying she might run for office if someone retires she probably went in

play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nA joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on\nThe differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal\nThe more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we have\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business and it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work\nBut it's but energy is the lifeblood of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened to Joe Manchin out his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you\nI spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policy that West Virginians really appreciate it so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today a I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with them when they count so you know I don't like to count on naming of post offices a procedural vote\nAre coming up news round up information overload our Sean Hannity show Marsha Blackburn and our next hour Danielle McLaughlin and Jonathan Gillum coming up and more straight ahead\n[noise] off\n... final round of information all\n\n\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender

loses ... home care this is the Patriot am eleven fifty\nAnd as we can anymore the Sean Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number Paul is in Ohio Paul you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you\nA good good first of all I Want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are\nAnd um uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr I Know other stories or you know kind of taking the lead now but we really don't share a whole bunch about a repeal and replace much anymore it was just wondering if you could give us\nAn update about Republicans are doing\nIf we in two weeks to have a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible in\nWest Virginia being and plays huge if we can hold on to the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races than the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have by the way preexisting conditions the big lie that's being told all over the country\nOr the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but you know innovative solutions like we've been talking about\nBeen able to get Dr Josh ember atlas MD in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita he's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks a treatment for people\nAnd you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack a cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge tear you ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor or your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals and\nIf something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario and it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... concierge medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states ...\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute but\nDoes the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on an absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done\nWe hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again every single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website Hannity dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida we're a little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on and about\nA we definitely need more than ... Sally war hero against this radical Christ in ... now no problems with Americans joining\nJihad to use and and joining the Taliban and then of course we've got Montana tests or has a lead at this point but that's still in play a Heidi Heitkamp is down by double digits\nA and Joe Donnelly is case he should be removed\nAnd we've got a good candidate brought against him but people can't waste their vote on the libertarian candidate in Indiana or else that's going to be a problem Bob Menendez can be beaten in New Jersey he's only up three\nBob Menendez could be the big surprise of the night second big surprise of the night is Joe Manchin losing in West Virginia you know the the state uh most worried about to be very honest to Florida\nBecause this guy Gillum is a radical socialist leftist if elected governor is going to ruin this great state\nAnd you want to see all the prosperity and all the money that has been flowing into Florida\nStart dissipating almost immediately and you're going to businesses packing up and leaving in anticipation of what Gillum would do to the state not a good idea I we got to take a break we'll come back eight hundred nine four one showing their toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program [noise]\n\nDid you know you can sell your life insurance policy even a term policy for an immediate cash payment call coming tree director one eight hundred five on oh twenty eight hundred or more visit Coventry direct dot com to learn more\nMarsha Blackburn um when you saw the tape of of reticence staff calling the people of Tennessee ignorant what was your reaction\nI looked at it and I said well let's say really think and this is typical liberal said try to hide and then somebody figures out exactly what it is that they are saying so there you go now we know\nThat we made a decision about a Supreme Court Josh justice for political reasons that was it\nTo Gail I'm looking I'm serving the country right now this is how I see the Democratic party there\nThey only want to talk about Russia collusion if it's Donald Trump they don't care at all the Hillary we now know bought and paid for Russian wise to disseminate to the American people before the election that those lives where the the bulk of information to secure\nPfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate they lived and committed fraud before the court and then they used to set up a special counsel by leaking that information they're leak media elite strategy but does that apparently was their\nTheir insurance policy when people like Peter Struck a saying that Hillary should win a hundred million is zero\nAnd I'm Wondering why don't they care about Hillary's Russian allies why do they not care about Keith Ellison ...\nYou know charges against him nobody is asking for FBI investigation into him and in that case we have tape syntax and doctors' reports or the recent charges against Spartacus or Cory Booker\nUm and it's the same on every other issue you know all the you know we have all these Democrats talking violently about the president Republicans on these mobs and most of the Democrats have been silent\nWell you're right say only skillet things which is a double standard and it doesn't matter what the issue is whether it's something legislative late that we're working on or something that is political and Sean what they want to do is say look our\nOur our ... our ends justifies the means that we're using to go about this to get to where we want to go and that is not the way Tennessee I Want to see ...

embarrassed again\nI'm certain that they should have been embarrassed whether or not but of course he didn't they start saying\nWell if it ... it was our campaign my campaign that put somebody in
