J. J. A. B. Los Angeles this is the Patriot am eleven fifty broadcasting throughout the south land and all over the world I heart radio Fox\nNews alerts presidents have repeal for unity hundreds to Brady after a string of suspicious packages mainly targeting high profile Democrats including former president bronco bomber\nOn almost every broadcast especially we have been covering it heavily\nI haven't been warning almost daily repeatedly someone is going to get hurt or worse if these mobs don't stop what they're doing now and the mobs in the case as I was talking about you know let through the prism of what we know today\nSuspicious packages pipe bombs that had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive but putting his mailbox and I listen what did I say about George Soros yesterday\nWhy they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported in a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this\nShow to go away I Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\n\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an electrician and Thirteen Days\nAnd on almost I you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the halls you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces fitting it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue but there's it's obvious what what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen isn't sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating\nThat's all they're doing he's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bang on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then starts screaming at the top of his lungs and then of course Kevin McCarthy is office gets hit with a Boulder busting his office window\nI didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activist they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a nationalist\nAnd his policies are the irony is all of the failure\nAnd the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and\nWomen in the workplace they weren't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific policies are bronco bombing sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying now you have a few famous people\nThat have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I had been saying this is not\nGoing to end well somebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nIt ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states\nYou want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe bomb suspicious\nPackages sent to the Clintons home and ... similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters and ... and apparently the one yesterday George tourists his home in Westchester New York suspicious packages center Debbie Wasserman Schultz is officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face\nHolder kick them they go low we kick them Hillary Clinton\nWe can't be civil with them unless of course we win you know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republican does any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um you know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had similar incidences of security in my life you\nKnow Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl at work for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news and she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation\nBecause we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that\nBut it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with reports of suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder is another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skull east nearly lost his life\nAnd to this day he struggles and has had so many operations they barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin hurt the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people\nI I never saw such heroism it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing and the build up to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nThis isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that still leaves the shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say say I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite I don't know I eat can't hold Bernice\nSay that and they they really going to all of a sudden discovered that oh Russia manipulated this election true is that going to be the play in my block\nSex life on the patriots am eleven fifty lame Maloney backs\nFor threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nPresident Trump condemning suspicious packages and explosive devices into high level of Democrats activist and a CNN contributor in New York one of the packages addressed you Bill and Hillary Clinton at their suburban New York home was intercepted we are fine\nThanks to the

states\nI'm you know it's uh what other things that I Am I I'm not surprised that but it 'cause it's all too predictable and that is this rush to judgment now that we have these the what looks like suspicious packages some\nPowder maybe pipe bombs all of this was going to be vetted out in the days to come the president has reacted very strongly today let off an opioid bill signing event at the White House\nAnd he was with the vice president he retweeted the vice presidents or comments on the emergency and condemning the bomb like incidents and online statements\nAs media outlets left wing politicians you know around the country we've got to protect our politicians they getting suspicious packages in the mail um\nWe know that if this happened to Donald Trump's family we know recently happened to Don junior and his family we know that it has happened just writes letters were sent to Trump and Madison ray and Haspel just three weeks ago and I frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIt ... Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is probably you know some fringe person out there somewhere\nOr it could very well be and and obviously the temperatures been hot as we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nStop confronting people like Pam Bondi stopped confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders

incidents so far at all we don't know if they're alive we'll get updates from shore throughout the day\nAnd now the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act so strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest than absolute priority so the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice\nWill spare no resources or expanse in this effort and I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd

like those on the ground\nSaying okay 'cause I got this ads or something or yeah or like making papal does she does support the wall and the other day I don't know but ah so don't say that she doesn't really want them to understand that people don't really understand this is my head\nYou are they're going to look at me while I\nWas right on the wall or was he on the one\nWho has a\nNo she didn't

[noise]\nDo they want to be like how they know\nThe amazing this is now number three British send the phony fake pony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [laughter]\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states the elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this other guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those uh Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your toaster down and the staffer says well\nBecause the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be settled liberate once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again\nSo because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know because Maxine Waters told us that are parties told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well ... ... ... yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really left or right thing I was at this first conference with all these big hon chosen media who were you know very cheering and and hearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in red states with these Democrats running\nIf they have to lie to the moderates they have to ruin the moderates and that and they can only make one choice one\nFor this is not a choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state and well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I'd never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill asked should be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone none it it it it comes to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated is like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the wrong with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something all Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks\nAnd how wrong is it for them to mislead the voters if it's it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way\n\nSo [noise] this is\nThe Fox news alert I'm Kathleen Maloney federal
