a moral be watching and waiting the whole time they don't look to let me tell you what the worst news is in the you know we've been watching all of this happened\nYou know all of this incivility that we've been monitoring and the silence has been deafening it's just been especially deafening from Democrats and the news media\nThey've been unwilling to criticize things they obviously should criticize and it's been going on two years this this is not a new phenomenon it takes on different forms it all started with Madonna I Wanna I Dream an awful lot\nAbout blowing up the White House and deteriorated from there and deniro wanting to punch the president in the face and Joe Biden wanting to punch the president taking mind oh yard and by then fight it out and Duke it out\nYou know this

stories of hookers\nUrine ... beds in Moscow and Donald Trump years ago in under rosy says I Can't confirm any of this is just you know well it's fifty fifty um it's raw intelligence what do I

there was no evidence of Trump Russia collusion and struck said that\nThere is no there there well then they start immediately strategy leaking again the same Clinton rushing dot CA and that becomes the basis of the appointment of Robert Mueller\nAnd then we go off investigating people's loans happily applications good grief it just is pathetic but they only cared about Trump Russia collusion media ignored that\nThen the media when it comes to judge Kavanaugh and the new Kavanaugh standard which is guilt by accusation well that to only is applied towards Republicans\nBecause I haven't heard Camilla Harris Spartacus or Dick Durbin or you know a Senator Feinstein or any of them ever demand an investigation and FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nThat's fairly recent and we're real

top of the hour let's tune in James O'Neill is the New York police department commissioner giving an update on the bomb investigation here's what he's saying\nHe's suspicious package investigations are conducting here in New York City\nFirst and foremost my message today is that New Yorkers are safe\nThere are no current credible threats twenty individuals organizations or locations here in New York City\nNew Yorkers are safe but everyone all eight point six million residents and the millions of visitors who come here every year should always remain vigilant\nAnd aware of their surroundings as always I urge people to alert us to anything that might seem strange route a place or anything that makes them feel uncomfortable they fled got a cop call nine one one or ... toll free counterterrorism number which is one eight eight eight New York city safe\nAnd that is for anything new or if someone as information about any of the incidents this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make towards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as they do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind of nothing we do in law enforcement we do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals who he agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision and I can say with certainty\nThat we will identify interested person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\nNew York city's intelligence and counterterrorism kinda terrorism capabilities are second it on every day they are not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over the threat stream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're seeing that today too out of an abundance of caution hotel you that when we look at the offensive yesterday and today I have a magic pride in incredible work the men and women are the NYPD do each and every day especially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today\nAll concluded by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the publicly served safe that's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe\nAnd through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works and and visit New York city who make the safest large city in the United states even safer just a matter of factly for anything of\nAny substance comes out the only thing they have said as the\nBombs had a powder meaning some type of explosive powder and broken glass uh which would mean the maximum amount of damage and shrapnel that ... that should they have gone off none of them had gone off usually in the mail bomb like that you would think if somebody opens it that's when they're going to realize that\nThat's the moment usually would detonate a thank God none of that has happened thank God\nI'm all packages or were lifted apparently Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the return address thankfully none exploded no one was injured and this full scale federal local investigation is to hunt down wherever those maniac is that would be responsible for such things you know it is um\nI don't care who it is you know if there is no place in this society for this type of violence these types of threats this intimidation it should have no place in politics or country you know this is evil ... we're talking about a ... I wanted act of terrorism here\nIt's a I having lived through some of this myself I Know how horrible it is my thoughts and prayers to go out to anybody that is involved in this it's just wrong I Want these guys put in jail for as long as possible\nAnd it shouldn't they should not have to be said no conservative I Know what ever support this horrible act or this type of violence depravity as a president condemned it yesterday um\nNobody knows who's responsible yet everyone's rushing to judgment like they usually do\nWhen they can politicized something\nYou know is this has now been unfolding you you watch people assigning blame or to all political rivals especially President Trump and they go to Fox News then talk radio\nAnd it goes on from there\nMeanwhile we have heard the

some insight as to profiling packaging whatever the case may be a and then he got on for a ten minute blast of the president\nI just think it's bizarre way over the top I said\nThey're going to get laid what happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining and detailed and you left in a sentence cameras following him for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then then you have to ruptured and said that it was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was set to CNN and his name um but then he got on and\nHe went on this had been a tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for it give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involved in the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the earpiece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers chase me down the block trying to get me to come back they were calling me but you know what an office enough already ...

so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day\nWe just have to keep out working on the way we out\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business you know it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's but energy is the lifeblood of our economy and\nOnce Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened to Joe Manchin out his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally joke go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of light\nThat's from our friends at the USCC a and don't forget to check out

Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number Paul is in Ohio Paul you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you a good good first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know they really are and uh uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nA I Know other stories or you know kind of taking the lead now but we really don't share a whole bunch about a repeal and replace much anymore\nIt was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf if we in two weeks to have a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and\nWest Virginia being and plays huge if we can hold on to the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races then the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have and by the way pre existing conditions of big lie that's being told all over the country\nOr the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh amber atlas MD in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita he's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults\nNinety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals or even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks or treatment for people and you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge charity ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOr your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals and if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario\nAnd it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there all the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... concierge medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been invasion\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website Hannity dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy safe go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida we're a little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on in Nevada\nUh we definitely need more than ...

when he he said well those are just college kids volunteers and we find out no that's a full time staff\nAre I'm sure that uh he was embarrassed again\nI'm certain that they should have been embarrassed whether they were not but of course he didn't they start saying\nWell it ... it was our campaign my campaign that put somebody in there which is not just as a project they're tough project they started saying well all these other excuses but the point as they got caught they got caught saying we made this decision\nBecause we want to go fool people about where he is don't worry he got to be a good kept crap when he gets there\nThey've got to say this that and the other in order to get him there and it's\nLike as a parent I mean when your kids do something wrong my could do something wrong\nWhich rarely happens are kidding but you know what it's not I'm I'm never is mad at what they did but if they try to lie to me about it then they're in big trouble\nNot a little

threat after threat but media never got all worked up in their lives or when it's a Republican look here's here's just the truth that they will never tell\nThey care about only Donald Trump Russia collusion with all the evidence that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for what shouldn't lies disseminated them\nTo you we the people in the lead up to the election that those Russian paid for lives of Hillary were used as the bulk of information presented to you know for Pfizer court judges\nThat the that predicated the entire Russia which ... which was the pony bought and paid dot CA of Hillary Clinton from with Russian lives\nThey only care they only care if it's Trump Russia\nThey don't care about anything else you know if you look at the cabinet situation oh Kevin all we need an FBI investigation these allegations are horrible none of those people that demanded an FBI investigation into nearly forty year old allegations\nSome of them so far fetched from reality they never once demanded an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison and this is in within the last year with evidence with tapes with text messages with\nDoctors reports uh nobody that was demanding the cabinet treatment for cabinet ever demanded or for Ellison or the recent report over the weekend about Cory Spartacus Booker or kick Claire McCaskill's husband and allegations made against him\nA when he was married to his first wife I mean if that's the standard none of the mass for the Clintons to have this Bill Clinton to go through the same thing the judge Kavanaugh went through they praise him to the hilt\nAnd we've got the same thing here I could literally spend an hour on this program playing the incendiary violence statements of those on the left that the media routinely ignored\nAnd the hatred all ... the minute by minute second by second hour after hour day after day Trump hatred twenty four seven which is now that it's a it's it's a psychotic pathology on the part of those in the news media they didn't care about that either\nData here but I I Do not have any doubts about things I think are totally possible here\n\nAnd just going to have to stick with me here in trust my my instincts on on being patient is\nGoing to be all kinds of time next week or whatever when this stuff continues to break and [noise] whatever all happens [noise] um I I I appreciate\nThe call and I know what you're saying a Susan over half of America gets more in\nWelfare than it pays in tax I should save this for next week you realize these this is the congressional budget office numbers more than half of Americans receive more in some kind of government transfer a payment Medicare Medicaid food stamp\nSocial Security then they pay in federal taxes more than half [noise] one thing that this explains why so many people don't think tax cuts are a big deal\nIf your life is dependent on all kinds of government transfer payments well whatever you want to call it and\nTax cuts you think are going to lead to the government having less money than you're not going to be in favor of tax cuts so we've got half over half of America gets more and welfare than they pay in taxes\nThey're going to understand here that tax cuts and I remember all the news stories about how the Republican tax cut bill didn't end up being that big a boon\nFor the Republicans in polling that's a major shift just since the Nineteen eighties there was a huge win win for Republicans back in the eighties and I think it still is to a certain extent but\nNot as big Frank in ah in New Baltimore Welcome sure your next hello\nHi rash thanks for taking my call your bet just real short here I think Mr ... dupe number one number two the van was set up\nPeriod I think if there's anybody\nWhat do you mean or do what do you mean to do\nThat he was shut up by other people and or he there's other people that are helping to ah\nDo all send all those things across the country which would be my last point is that if there's anybody that thinks that man could have been initiated and follow through with all those mail bombs across the country on his own I think are delusional\nAnd that that that ban was just just a a set up just to a\nSo CNN and MS LSD could ah swallow it and they did hook line and sinker\nSo when you say when you said do do you mean that the Democrats or somebody found this guy and are setting him up and he doesn't have any idea what just happened to him or that he has been ... convinced to play along and be a part of it which do you mean\n[noise] a little bit of both um\nWe'll find out in the future I'm sure we'll wait that will we will we will we find out you said I'm sure we'll find out and they will wait hopefully I'll\nProbably now this guy was a do if he was minding his own business going to strip clubs and a number and all of a sudden finds himself in jail and came out of his house one day I saw him van with all that stuff on it and now is in jail for sending pipe bombs [laughter] you think that's possible\nA little\nLittle but more than likely I think he was he was in on it somehow but it's still being we're up to do that he was persuaded do you think he was persuaded to take the fall if he was a dupe\nMm yes okay All right well well I I I'm Sorry what was that what were you saying\nI think he just felt that uh just to get his name in the paper or he had nothing else better to do with his wife and a figure hey I'm going to make a name for myself and be on the six o'clock news and ah [noise]\nWell I tell you what this guy made it to the news before

she was one of the people that was targeted by by all of this but other postings you know um if you look at\nA that they don't seem to express admiration for Trump's politics so you got the other side of this you know crediting Trump on the one hand would strategies with helping him open up a sports bar you know why he would put that up there in any way that seems a little odd and weird and\nUh but I think what we're dealing with somebody with a great instability\nIs one is from MSNBC is Andrea Mitchell a promise to repay your door apply to your threats\nYou know we will answering coming to see you soon and uh with his arrest by the way it means one lunatic one maniac is off the streets thank God\nAnd um we uh we have to just credit law enforcement for the good work that they do and it's amazing the DNA trail led to this Florida Man\nHe had his fingerprints on some of these bombs that basically there were small PVC bombs and from what we can determine they all had powder and them some type of electric some type of electrical connection device director re described it here's a little bit of what he had to say\n\nIn that effort and getting those devices to our lab from around the country [noise] we can confirm\nThat Thirteen ICD for sensitive areas individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe [noise]\nA small clock a battery some

are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day\nYou know the sad thing about all of this you know I Want to remind you\nBecause ah you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explained that in a minute but\nYou don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut off all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact is he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through the time was far worse than was reported\nUm people wanting to blame Bernie Sanders if you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I I'm not going to do with the left does here Bernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans\nAnd Bernie said he was sick and by the entire you know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him and I said that\nAnd just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and as it came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but\nProtecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans he is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said Mr speakers you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas that is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and anytime any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um\nThere's this idiot on fake news CNN is named my ... what's his name John Avalon somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part ... when he but basically blaming me listen to this\nSean Hannity says had a direct language ... may have we don't we don't know who is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage big echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the conservative judge you which is not like the others right why Robert De Niro\nWell one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blessings in Europe for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things which you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes ... Robert De Niro is calling the president devil and us devil worshippers in effect you know\nI'm used to play the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and especially the see what is that what we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ...\nMe because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's a hung his\nDog he's a big he's a con artist mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care thinks she's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he said the virus minutes of this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this pool this Bozo has wound up where he has talked how he wants to punch people in the face well\nI'd

is the Patriot am eleven fifty role long eight hundred ... you're not going to get it this is a\nDouble standard in the media you get conservative as I say you can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible because one of his ... supporters went out there and shot somebody\nBut it's there there is an obsession to always blamed conservatives for the actions of some of these ... cases in that appears to be the media talking point for the hour for the day here\nUm you know if you expose somebody is being absolutely insane you you know it doesn't matter what their politics are managed that we keep America safe\nYou know when I when I go out there and say I'm not going to go ... into the silly ridiculous road of saying well because that guy like Bernie Sanders any shot up Republicans on a ball field and Bernie must support that I said just the opposite is true\nYou know it is beyond reckless and irresponsible for CNN and all of them to ignore the rhetoric of De Niro and Madonna I think an awful lot about blowing up the White House they called the president twenty four seven on that network a liar they've gone deep\nInto the conspiracy theory of Trump Russia collusion with no evidence but ignore such collusion when we do have evidence as it relates to Hillary\nThey fall into the all the Kavanaugh standard but only because he's a Republican or appointed by Republican but they're in love with

know the amazing thing just had dead silent the news media has been\nI don't have a lot of time that I'm going to waste here yet on John Avalon or whatever his name is over it fake news CNN well deniro is not like the others why Robert De Niro about what I found is Sean Hannity was do we just\nHeard De Niro and what the narrow was saying about the president's our president De Niro saying that he wants to punch the president in the face that they do any research over there you know over a fake news CNN any at all\nYou see a pattern between the president's attacks on Twitter and and stage being echoed an amplified by Fox News wire Robert Deniro Sean Hannity October fifteenth that old segment blasting deniro\nOh so that's why he got a package from this lunatic bomber because he must have heard Sean Hannity playing the narrows own words calling the president up punk a dog a pig of calm a BS artist a mutt and saying that he wants to punch him out\nWant to tell you something because this is it doesn't ... you can explain crazy\nLike the Bernie guy was crazy you can explain wherever this guy he is and apparently there's the Yahoo News report saying that he was not\nOn the one hand loving and hating Trump at the same time lunatics have no political boundaries you know the guy don't hold Al Gore responsible for the Unabomber because he had earth and the balance and is that little ... that he built out in the wilderness\nOr the shooter as Steve squeezed blaming Bernie Sanders\nTo suggest any way that honest a vigorous debate and criticism is the motivating force behind one fringe violent individual\nLet me tell you what that is that is intellectual laziness and a cheap attempt frankly to capitalize off a dangerous and serious incident especially in light of the fact while others on TV have been utterly silent their silence has been deafening\nI've been the ones saying something horrible is going to happen it needs to stop\nYou know do you say CNN sucks or CNN is fake news that is not a cry or an ad vacation of violence in any way shape or form it's a feeling people have when they see a few abusive leap bias news coverage\nIf you're American with is sold a should transcend politics\nI deplore all violence of any kind but legitimate fair criticism of me that's fair game media criticism is fair game\nCalling out networks that have political agendas that's fair game when network spend every second minute and our of the day hating on Donald Trump Donald Trump cured cancer they still hate him well I'm allowed to call that out that's not hate if there's any hate their it's their hatred of the president that they can't seem to get over\nYou know the bottom line is you're watching people trying to eight and attempt to exploit and politicize the actions of one unhinged lunatic and conflated with fair and wanted criticism\nAnd that for them as they're putting politics above all else and that's wrong for the country and anybody that has intimidated into stopping what they do because of this predictable attack I put it all up on Hannity dot com\nAnd it's called the left new low Hannity slams the media's total failure to report liberal calls for violence yeah we've got it all chronicled with all we we put the tape and everything you need one place\nAnd we're going to tweet that or we're going to send that out to everybody weren't loving days away from election day and there's a lot at stake\nRight now Republicans you know what they're behind I think in Florida that means Rick Scott's behind that means the Santa is behind there's a lot at stake in Florida goes to Gillum in terms of governing the state of Florida it will be a disaster that was my prediction\nIt doesn't help that many of been displaced in the panhandle a very conservative part of Florida and I hope those people are able to get back and enabled to vote before the election but I can tell you Marsha Blackburn can and should win in Tennessee if everybody goes out and vote\nAnd I think the Missouri can be flipped easily now that we know that Claire McCaskill just like the British sent in Tennessee has been lying through AT T about who she really is she's talking about you know crazy Democrats ... votes left on everything so I guess she's counting herself in that group\nI Know Dean Heller can win in Nevada and I certainly believe Martha ... he can beat the radical extremist Christian seminar cinema I think Jon Tester can be beaten to although he was a little bit up in the polls right now in Montana\nHeidi Heitkamp should lose in North Dakota Joe Donnelly if people don't split the ticket and vote libertarian he would lose easily to Braun in Indiana that would be another pick up\nThat was for far as the four hundred and thirty five members of

Hunter seat is in jeopardy gotta get him back in Congress and all the tricks that they've been playing out in Southern California and you got sheets will talk to Claudia Tenney in New York seats in New Jersey seats in Illinois are at stake Minnesota Michigan Wisconsin\nYou know every all four hundred and thirty five that means everybody hearing my voice right now\nYou need to get out and vote eleven days or you'll get Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Chuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader it's going to stop the progress we've made\nThat we can have a full victory hold on to the house and Senate and pick up seats in the Senate you gotta have a split decision where maybe we pick up seats in the Senate lose the house and then you gotta have a total failure disaster debacle if you don't vote but again that's up to you\nAll right eight hundred nine four one shot a lot of news to get to we have our pollsters coming up at the top of the next hour all look at all these races around the

everyone you let's stop what we're doing right now and ...\nJust like that we had a nice special sort of moment together of course they don't all need to be quiet moments to be special that they can be loud moments goofy moments\nSporty moments dorky moments moments where we talk or\nJust hang\nBecause Everytime dad's like us take a moment like\nTo spend with our kids\nIt was pretty momentous [noise]\nHas got those odds and those are scary odds because it flows he takes over the house you know she's going to have open borders you know she's going to want to raise taxes you know show hunted killed jobs she'll put back and regulations and guess what they're going to try to impeach the president so\nYou've really got just over a week to try to stop policy and the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focused on that and run a very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent there's a story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amounts it's by big amounts so you have to rational race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in Virginia ten were Barbara concepts running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point\nIt had all the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million between the Republican groups in a center account I mean Congress on concept so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats blows you become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by I guess any measure right\nIt's a split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house I think of the committees that are going to change\nTo think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the\nWith the ah with all these investigations et cetera\nGuess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee ... there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go they'll go check his taxes illegal this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us\nPollsters we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election well you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same area you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see it between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house that that is correct time could jak thing very young when they are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nI Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare\nAnd I think he is right to say that the Democrats are mobilized and focus on the um on the house the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one with a dirty secret\nIt's not so much Donald Trump is at risk if the Republicans in the house and Senate will have much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt one of the weaknesses as it relates also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty five separate retirements are incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people in a lot of these races is negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical seats that the Republicans really need to win and and the dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to them but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to him as former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC as putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands that they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and had to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered\nDelivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for Nineteen Ninety four in September that had we had the generic Republicans up seven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and we just need to not compromise on Clinton care\nWell Haley Barbour barred ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some they have the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh uh uh Democrats their National Committee two to one of\nThe ... that money needs to find its way into the into these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races weather's digital LEDs a TV ads even nationally and saying stop polo see\nWe've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats and uh uh ... they've really they really are focused on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell they're shot a power but remember you know as those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state in I don't believe that's true but there's we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly\nIf the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass that is going to be against what the Republicans want in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there\nAnd we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be basically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations showed trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters you know Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically now there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean\nWill not recognize our country in the very near future\nGlenn Beck currently I'm In the morning just fix on the\nNews I enjoy the odds of a supporter of President Trump who police they had the criminal history is arrested in connection with

second congressional district in New York a toss up millions of dollars being spent up in and around the entire region\nA which is northern north of New York city in and around the Syracuse area and she joins us now uh Syracuse dot com pulls one point raised Claudia it can't get any closer and uh it's typical of a lot of races that are going around around the country Audi pulled us out\nYeah it's tough it's not the race just for my life it for the people that live here it's for protecting the tax cuts the\nOne time we finally got a real tax cut direct money into the pockets of the people that live here instead of all that high taxes and spend that we've received from Albany under Governor Cuomo under the progressive socialist and ... and New York city that basically run our ... our state and my opponent is one of them he\nActually has a lower conservative rating than some of the most socialist\nLeft leaning Democrats and the New York state assembly and he's trying to cast himself as a Republican or a moderate in his district is narrow brief wants the word Democrat\nHe's trying to deceive and conduct voters here and just say okay I'm a moderate I get along I work with everyone you know when he gets he sucks up to Cuomo silver and whomever is telling them what to do and he's one of the twenty four Democrats\nAcross this country who is trying to deceive the voters by saying oh no

the governor of New York I'll say that and you know the district by the way approves of the way the president's doing his job of according to the latest polls and Trump won the district by by the healthy what ten point margin over Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen eleven points to be specific\nAnd it's a district that has benefited ... not because of anything Albany has done I mean there was a recent editorial about how bad upstate New York has become\nUnder Cuomo and you know I sat with him and he looked in the eye and said he's going to open up tracking before the last election he just liked to my face he did the exact opposite right after he was elected\nAnd meanwhile Pennsylvania's economy is growing up because they are now ... securing the prosperity of natural gas that exist in their state and we can be doing the same thing up in your area and we don't do it\nYeah actually we call it the Berlin Wall my district goes into Binghamton grim county which is on the border of Pennsylvania\nAnd you see the stark difference between the southern tier which has watched so many jobs this is where IBM was actually founded now we've lost it thanks to the policies of the Democrats in Albany that have just strangled our economy\nWe're actually seeing an uptick I have a small business owner and this district our family business which started in Nineteen forty six\nI mean if every Trump voter wants the success of the last two years to continue and goes to vote Republican in eleven days then that means we'll keep the house will pick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve you\nKnow I've had many ups and downs following political races in the course of my career wasn't exactly happy the two nights that Obama won I especially thought he could have been defeated in twenty twelve alright it didn't happen\nAnd you do everything it can to stop the agenda on their side I'm prepared for whatever Nancy Pelosi an Adam Schiff a Jerrold Nadler and Maxine Waters want to do to the country\nAnd we're not going to go away we're not going to cry we're not going to be cry babies like they've been for the last two years and when they tried to do things that are detrimental to the country and the president and they want to enlist investigations were going to be there\nAs a backstop to tell the American people the truth\nAnd then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote this election season so don't wait until I'm telling you what's going to happen we know they only want Obamacare we do they want to open borders they don't want to fund the wall they believe in open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nWe know they want their crumbs back we know they want higher taxes we know they you know they don't they don't really ... they're all things hating Trump all the time not exactly in the best interest of the country to

worried about the panhandle and as much as you know a lot of\nPeople who've been displaced were in the middle of early voting the panhandle is crucial to the entire state of Florida you\nHave two very tight races you got the sand is running for governor and you've got rich got running for senator and if the people that have been displaced can't get back and vote that's going to be problematic uh for dissent distance gotten any chance they have a winning\nWell that's what I'm calling to urge my fellow and to get out and vote vote Governor Scott needs are but they're hoping that will be too busy doing work up for them to get out\nWell in Florida early voting is ongoing so that means you can go any time between as I understand it now and election day\nUm I Know it's hard especially for people some people have lost their everything they've lost their entire home they'd been relocated and they don't have a chance to change their voter registration probably so that means that have to go back to where they live in or they can get an absentee ballot I don't think it's too late for that\nEleven days but you'd have to check in with your local elections office\nYes that's correct I saw it on the news the other day about the absentee ballot it's still a viable\nBut I I mainly encourage everybody to get out and vote yeah just call your local elections office having\nSuch an absentee ballot if you're not there if you can get back in and vote obviously you know Rick Scott won both races only by one percent I mean Gillum is now up which would does it scares the daylights out of me based on you know his agenda\nAnyway I Hope the on all our best to our friends in the panhandle we know you've been through a lot and uh our prayers and thoughts with you as you begin to rebuild it

and northern coastal la San Diego area that that is that in trouble or is that coming back\nI'm afraid that that's coming back there is as a uh well I make sure that I'm afraid that the art candidate Diane Harkey is in trouble there but you know ... what counts as not poll beforehand was counts as a poll on election day and\nA white man heart out to oppose tax increases in California's immigration sanctuary law but the state right\nWing right [noise] well no what it is if it's frankly a just a personal issue on her and her campaign and the Democrats certainly know how to use personal issues they know how to use name calling thing that they they basically what every time you disagree with one of them\nYou you end up are racist or not for your arm and this is what are the way at least I Believe ... to people who are\nA bit off maybe they're fighting psychologically the rangers somebody but when they hear the left wing calling us Nazis and calling us racist and ... and and having people like Diane Watson and others\nPublicly saying that we should be a timid dated and be accosted while we're eating in a restaurant the Democrats never complain about that and it gives these nut cases a an an idea\nHow's Duncan hunters district looking I Know they went after him and his wife personally but he seems to be holding back\nUm his opposition is struggling to get any traction at one time Obama campaign worker he seems to be holding his lead in his district right that's a ... congressional district in in San Diego and riverside county\nWell Duncan Hunter is a is a treasure and his people do that and uh\nUh they are he he had some trouble or his treasure was not keeping the books right and got him in trouble I understand my treasure by the way ... years ago stole two hundred

race\nGoing on with my we're all in tight races like like Denham has been again such a fantastic congressman for his own people he's watched out for them\nI ... I have a couple of disagreements with him but the fact is I Know is energetic and will step forward and he will argue the case for his people any time so it is and although he's being outspent but I'm sure I look I'm being outspent by six or seven to one\nAnd let me know Bloomberg kicking in another four million dollars and the last week of a campaign all of us we're facing now but when the public knows who we are like\nLike with Duncan Hunter they know who drunk and hotter as they know that um they they they know us personally and they know where I work trying to return to protect them we speak for them\nAnd the other people are just calling names and joined the liberal left behind [noise]\nAlright well those in Southern California all the seats that we're talking about ISIS old seat Duncan Hunter seat obviously the case of Dana Rohrabacher I mean these have been strong solid conservative voices now in your case or what for a couple of decades now in Congress and you're one of the few people that I wanted to stay there\nUh no actually you know keep your promises and work hard for the people in your district so we're all day and I just wanted to look let us know if we can help at all as you go through this\nWell you you are you are shot and we all remember every lose control of the house that's reduce each being the mileage maimed the Democrats or grind our country to a halt there will be gridlock there will be all sorts of\nTerms to disrupt the president from getting anything done and we don't want to you don't want to just how presidents presidents in any more than ... left us already done\nAll right thanks so much for being with us Dana Rohrabacher eight hundred dying for one Sean toll free telephone number by the way some angel families those families that have had loved ones killed by illegal immigrants in the country they are actually planning to go down proactively to the border to have to meet the caravan should they make it that far\nA let's get tore a busy phones will talk to them a let's say Hi to Donna is in Frederick Marilyn Donna Hi how are you glad you called eleven days away\nHi Shaun yeah I Can't wait to get out there and vote and I've got several people up in my mind in keeping tabs we we have to get out there this is such a a referendum against the socialists and I've got to say and live with the events they\nYou know these devices that never detonated you know I call them I guess a spacious devices 'cause we don't really know if they were actually bombs but it got\nMe to make sure that that's been confirmed as they when they said they had powder I'm assuming there was some type of gun powder\nOr some type of explosive powder and then had shrapnel in it like a lot to chart a glass and you know we've got to get to know a little bit more about this guy short of the van that had a CNN sucks picture on it in a picture of Donald Trump but doesn't mean a thing and\nYou know by the way I remember when I when Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot up that baseball field\nSaid at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWe know what I mean I'm not going to do with the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him\nWell it's a different tact than you hear from the media today right\nRight and you know what what concerns me and thank you for correcting me about the update on the um the bomb threats what I'm concerned about is\nAs he mentioned the van with all the stickers okay perhaps it is somebody from the far right but I'm noticing what I'm hearing is the the strategic ... as far as how they were placed how they with no\nYou know issue with the ... south but the other thing I thought about was William Clyde Allen who\nThreaten people with rice and a couple of weeks ago and he was arrested and I'm starting to question could there be a connection between those little vigilance could there be more than one person involved in this whole\nScenario that's been going on for as you well know months because the family was threatened as well\nAs it and I've gone through a lot of this it's not fun and I don't talk about it a lot of ... I've I've shared about one percent of the things that I've dealt with throughout my career frankly I don't think anybody wants to hear it and it's sadly is a part of being in the public eye and having strong political views it's it really is unfortunate\nUm but that's why I was I think\nWhat we should be able to be able to do so you know without fear of any type of retribution and\nApparently that's not how it's going to work but you know look it's let's wait and see I Am getting mixed messages all over the place\nOn this man this guy this background we have to find out if there were accomplices here we were just beginning to put it together or people can assume what they want but as we have always done is we're not going to rush to judgment at all in this program and we're going to wait and see and when we know the truth will pass it on to you\nOr we can yeah well we ... we don't know\nYeah the truth matters and China I Want to say one other thing to do with respect to the invasion what concerns me about that and it's not really getting recorded much is how many people\nAre sick and we have children dying from early on like illnesses now so what talk in the brain and that's another\nIssue I you know I'm concerned about\n[noise] yeah well look we got we always got to stay on top of all these diseases and stay ahead of it and thank God we have some brilliant

was never Trump or and\nYou know now he writes a book and he devotes twenty pages of is failing book against me and you know lo and behold nobody wants to buy his book as I predicted and I just think it's amazing because when he was running he was begging us to put them on the air as often as we could and we even put an audio out of him praising me\nAt the almost daily so I guess\nYou know he says now I'm Bad for America but I was pretty good for Ben Sasse in America at the time that he wanted to use these airwaves every day to get his message out\nYeah and I'll tell you at least in my district which encompasses about a three quarters of the west end of the state of Nebraska I'm that's Adrian ... district I'm Ben Sasse is not real popular right at the moment I'll just put it that way yeah\nWell look I I personally feel like on a level it doesn't happen to me ... very often he said everything that I thought would would make a great senator and lead the great people as a brass SCA

go ahead what's what else on your mind well\nI'm with the package bombs devices\nAre I think this is kind of um something that uh something in the media and some on the left have kind of been wanting to happen um with their insightful language or Cory Booker telling people to get in Congress many spaces\nI'm Nancy Pelosi she comes out and she says if there is a collateral damage on the side of those who are against us well then so be it um in Brock Obama himself when he was telling a people to kill their ticket in their families in Britain spaces\nAnd let them know what about\nAll I got to run here but Logan let you go thank you so much for your call eight hundred number one Sean is our number if you want to be a part of the program quick break right back I Will continue a lot more news
