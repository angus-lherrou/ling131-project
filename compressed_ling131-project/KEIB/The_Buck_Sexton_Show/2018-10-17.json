I I Would I don't I just want to be contract or I didn't want to be owned by the why\nNow I was there that you're just you're just a teacher right now and what you get in there and you you work out all the kinks out of your system and you learn how to do it any develop a reputation with people I but I mean\nI'll let you necessarily have a business name on this they may just pay you as a teacher there at the Y. for right now but that will get some income coming in and get you in the field actually doing this and then the next step would be that you could actually rent\nPart time someone else's gym to do this with or part time someone else's ball fields to do this and you know you're gonna you're gonna start there if you want to be got the money if you got a little bit of cash\nNow I Know I'm starting from scratch basically a plan that I had that dream or age for the longest time and now that I've had a book and I can hear our cats empowered I'm Josh Rogers nowhere to go how do\nI think I might make some money kind of almost as a side job doing this exact thing at the Y. or at some place like a why first and as I said then you get the kinks out of your teaching methods and all that kind of stuff then the next step is you take that cash\nAnd that gives you the ability to rent the gym or rent the ball field on a per day basis\nBut right now let's say you go rent a ball field and and you can't get anybody to sign up for your course\nOh my gosh you just lost all that money oh wait a minute you don't have any money oh my gosh you just got into that no we don't wanna do that\nSee that's that's what I'm trying to avoid so let's create a little bit of money while learning a few things about how to talk to people how to teach people how to coach people and prove out some of your ah dreams and your theories that you've got here by just poking around on under somebody else's roof a little bit and then\nThen when we got a little bit of cash we can go rent the ball field or rent the Jim Bob a day\nFor a little while and then um you know that way will break you if you don't get clients are right off the bat or when I started financial piece University Our a office building allowed us the people that were tenants in the office building they had a common conference room that you could book\nDoesn't cost anything but you had to book it and you couldn't just keep it book you had to just look at you know for a meeting you can you know other people go in there you should have meetings and he'll like a hundred and thirty people as a nice size little conference room and all of meeting room kind of thing tables that moved round and all of that that's where a financial peace university started\nIs in that little conference room\nAnd I'm pretty cool if you think about\nIt and so but I had to just book it as a part of renting the little office that I was in and show but it wasn't really my meeting room it was the office buildings meeting room\nAnd you could just use it and so I booked it in the evening and then I looked at and another evening that I've looked at another evening and then I was looking at so much they asked me to start paying a little bit and then I started paying a little bit but I had a lot of classes going by them but I just the first night I did that for people came\nThank goodness I didn't rent that thing for the month and therefore people come\n'cause we would have probably gone out of business that month [laughter] so that's what I'm saying it's OK to start it on a very piecemeal basis and started on the cheap\nThere's nothing wrong with that at all I'm really proud of you can do this or do do it go do it it's time to do it it's time to get off the dream and move into the actual action go do it you can do this a promise you you can do this very well done good good good\nLara follows me on Facebook dot com slash Dave Ramsey is it worth it to refinance a student loan to save on interest if you're

this down to what it is the Saudis kill the guy on destroy with another country in a consulate is it disgusting and barbaric yes do the Saudis do disgusting ... all the time absolutely\nThat is nothing new\nWhy is this our problem I keep hearing about how what what what is Trump going to do what is going to do\nWhat could he do and why is it on him shouldn't as\nWe don't we have a United

anything yeah exactly they won't do anything we're all day\nBut when they when they don't like what the US is doing it's oh why don't you wait for the international community it's it's better if it

we're still at ... at which we are still in war\nUm we don't hear about it do we we don't hear about the fact that we're in the process of slowly losing that or\nThey don't want it they they don't talk about that anymore\nOr they want to focus on this issue and I would say it's not just because they do feel journalist do feel a special affinity for other journalists right that this hits home for them\nNot so much during the Obama years when Obama was pulling the phone records of journalist and listing on the OJ charging sheets on indicted co conspirators as you know journalists\nBut you and that was Obama oh that's right you know tough guy tapper which you know a\nDamn ideas saying that that you are really the best this administration the best messenger on that issue yeah that's\nA

we should not lose sight of that we don't know what happened to his show we have not been told what the facts or this case they're still trying to figure it out but everyone wants Trump to take action they they want to push the president I'd states the leader of the free world\nTo do something that could upset the balance of power in the middle East that could have long term ramifications and they don't care about any of that what they really just want is the opportunity to criticize the president for inaction and then dump all over him for whatever action he takes\nThese people are disgusting or disgrace none other than\nChief national security propaganda is for the Obama administration Ben Rhodes takes this to the next level and you know it's once again it's always about Trump it's all Trump's fault somehow everything that the left doesn't like is Trump's fall play sixteen\nAnd met with President Trump is sending is it there is no consequences and what you have to realize is there's nobody else who can play the role the United states to hold people like this to a cat\nAnd we are the world's oldest and most significant democracy and we're not as if we're not standing up for this there's not somebody else is going to do that and the consequences of that are journalist everywhere are less safe and and let's face it we have a president fitness days are also the states so for a

actually looked at the numbers you know the from the committee to protect journalists and all that stuff who wants to get how many journalists have been killed in America since Nineteen Ninety two\nEleven eleven\nHow many people in this country since Nineteen Ninety\nTwo alright stretching back now for all you know going\nOn three decades those is what is it eight sixty eight Eighteen twenty six years\nFor almost Thirty years\nHow many people have been killed in this country we're journalists and he wanted to guess three three people have been killed for journalism in America in Thirty years and not by the state but just by people that didn't like the the journalist through stories on them\nAnd when you look at the numbers abroad I'm not saying there aren't bad states and there aren't a child during regimes but they'd been bad\nAll along they've been battle\nBy way of comparison we've had three journalists killed in twenty six years in this country you know how many

placate or by this at all they're not okay they don't say oh All right you know because ... says we just need the facts and will hold them accountable they're not they're not slowing down all they want to jump all over\nThat their plan they want to jump all over the president and the vice president on this issue as much as they can and they're not waiting for anything they don't wanna wait for the fact that when a wait to see what action he takes day just prefer this notion that you know\nTrump is a bad guy that helps them sleep and one of them I I Would disagree with vice president Pence on on one matter or the notion that this is an attack\nOn an independent press okay well he would write for the Washington Post but Saudi Arabia doesn't have an independent press at all not not even a little bit okay there there is not an independent press and sort of your people say oh buckets been getting a little better than read yeah whatever\nTurkey doesn't have an independent press in fact the country workers Shelby was from what we see from what we believe murdered is one of the worst in the world when it comes to press freedom not Saudi Arabia turkey bad when it comes to press freedom\nSo when we say it's an attack on a free press yeah we live in a world where the free press is the exception not the rule lotta countries have all kinds of constraints on what can be printed what can be said what can be shared\nLots of countries\nAnd even countries that you think of as having a free press maybe some of the western European states for example they have\nRestrictions based on you know hate crime legislation and all all kinds of stuff in Britain there's no oh you can ... you can print national security secrets because you're the press they had the official secrets act lock your butt up they don't care if it's a matter of public importance they'll just lock you up\nSo I just think everyone needs to take a deep breath and understand that yes this is bad\nYou asked the U.S should send a strong message but it's not the worst thing that's ever happened to the history of mankind we need just take a step back here and understand that people die all over the world under terrible circumstances everyday doesn't mean you ignore at all but it just means that you need perspective here\nAnd what we're going to do even if we find out that the Saudis are as culpable as is as has been alleged from the very beginning meeting all the way up at the top\nMaybe will not sell them some munitions was ever going to sell them maybe we'll send them a a strong reprimand under we have no legal authority to do anything about this we are not signatories the United states is not a signatory to the international criminal court so we can't go there\nAnd we're not a certain for for good reason which is that the notion of an international criminal law doesn't really exist I mean yeah there's war crimes I guess but\nTry and forcing knows unless you've already beaten the country\nAnd brought them just admission that you want to punish people and because of their war crimes that it's just it's really easy to the bank the tough guy drum on this issue it's it's a lot harder to sit back and actually come up with constructive ways to deal with all this\nYou know it's really easy to say oh you know I'm I'm all about a free press and Trump isn't doing enough or what should we do I'm not just saying oh we can't bring 'cause she'll be back because we can't\nBut he's not he's not an American why does it fall\nOn us why does it fall on us just wonder you know wondering why that is\nOf people that shows up at the border and I'll get to come in the United states why do we even have immigration laws why do we have a border patrol\n... what is the purpose of all this\nIf lives are just going to grandstand every time and act like anyone who has any questions about just bringing a ... whoever wants to come in this country can say she ultimately here's the problem\nThat the leftist project the really the socialist or the Democrats socialist project in Western Europe and in America because there are Democrats socialist year as we know who the feathers and others Elizabeth Warren but she's got other problems right now\nThe problem that the Democrat socialist project has to face is that they believe in open borders but they also believe in a welfare state a massive welfare state that doesn't work the Math Doesn't add up and also people\nAre willing to help the less fortunate from within their own community from within their polity right their political union there is still a sense of nationhood of nationalism should I say where you want to you know I\nI Want to help Americans first\nIf we're gonna have a welfare state in this country it should be to help those who were American all races grades and colors help them if they're out on their luck and we're gonna have welfare state that should be but if if we have a policy of essentially anybody who shows up\nAnd has a ... a sob story about how their country has not I'm not talking to people that just generally that are facing any imminent violence they just say oh\nThe jobs here are better well guess what if I show up in Switzerland and say hey that I like this place better it's cleaner it's more civilized I demand citizenship they're going to put my button on a plane and kick me out of the country never let me back and I was going to feel sorry for me\nThere is an order that country's try to maintain\nOther countries are allowed to have borders not only that other countries are not expected to take in millions and millions and tens of millions\nOf people from a different culture who speak a different language and once they come to this country increasingly claimed that this country is not fair to them because we don't do enough for them\nI was under the impression that if you came to America you're supposed to feel grateful and legal immigrants by the way of you listening Hi five thank you welcome to be part of the American family legal immigrants overwhelmingly do but I Do see a trend among illegal immigrants\nWhere do they think that we owe them something\nWe owe them not just citizenship not just permanent residency but also all the goodies that the state can offer free health care free school free housing free everything\nEven America with are incredible economy and our economic dynamism and thank you Trump for showing us that growth\nGrowth under Obama for all the people are saying well I'm a ... show where growth under Obama in his last year in office was like one point something percent growth under Trump second year in office GDP over four percent\n\nSingle best measure we have of economic activity in what's going on in this country so he was the goal of the Obama economy we're slowly please yes there was a natural economic reset that occurred Obama made it slower and more painful and less powerful than it would have been had he not gotten in the way but he was\nIgnorant of economics I mean Obama is just not somebody who understands business not somebody who ever had to look at a balance sheet for any length of time not somebody who had to run a business of any kind you know he was in the business of Obama different\n[noise]\nBut the facts facts cannot be allowed to get in a way of the left is narrative with all this stuff this group is going to come to the border\nAnd they are going to be in a position\nWe can either let them in or not and you know what the liberals are going to say let them in and we're going to turn around and say hold on\nAnd second but it is their claims of asylum allow them entering the country what we're really saying is that anyone can come and stay as long as they want anyone is allowed to show up in this country\nAnd\nWe are effectively have an open border\nBecause all that all that's required for someone who's to say the right things now the word is out now we know what the loopholes All right now the people in these communities that are coming into this country no that all as you say is I fear violence in my home country\nI fear violence I mean violence can happen at any one country there's a song especially for people that are fleeing either a horrific natural disaster and by the way they're supposed to go back usually we give them temporary status for natural disasters\nOr because we're ... we're carrying country but we're not supposed to be Trump's rock supposed to just be you know the the the fat cow to be milked by the rest of the world and that's what's happening the Democrats have no way of turning his back by the way\nThey understand or they understand that quite honestly\nThere is\nNo way that they can explain to the American people what it is that they really want if they told the truth to Americans would ever\nWould have a lot of folks would say oh what a second I don't think that's going to work I don't think you can just bring in endless amounts of foreigners\nNot through the legal process not go through the normal channels of assimilation that had been in this country for centuries now or join this community that now liberals speak to specifically be illegal immigrants in this country the quote on documented\nThe ranks of the aggrieved undocumented and try to get them access to the public treasury as fast as possible we are Twenty one trillion dollars in debt I'll talk to you more about that later on the show bringing people without a high school level education and without English language skills by the millions is not actually\nMaking our economy stronger that is why\nThere's an obvious lie if if Americans are not\nBalancing the budget at the end of the year for the American people are actually paying as they go when it comes to government spending we really think that bringing a lot of foreigners who don't have skills who aren't going to remember I'm Talking about illegal foreigners\nThey're going to be the ones that set the economy right I don't think so I Know you know this too but man is it frustrating it is frustrating\nThat you're going to hear some of it's just going to turn into one big media

[laughter]\n[laughter] sometimes referred to as ... as\nHe has defeated really progressive front runner for twenty twenty before she was even able to get into the race officially\nAnd he defeated or by getting inside her head and forcing her to make one of the great on forest political errors of all time I have never seen anything quite like this uh this ... this is truly truly astonishing\nUh but then the president had this thing today later on that I got to say I don't know what's going on here I Want the president focused on what matters and I want the president on policy among fighting back absolutely\nBut what is this thing about\nWhat is this thing about oh horse Oh yes here's what he wrote federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump\nTrump is entitled to a legal fees\nGreat now I can go after a horse race and the third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total calm you know it's interesting Trump really hold out here that that this is\nA lie start to finish and I have thought that ah that that there is no way that she's lying about Trump just because of the detail and they look they do know each other they have had contact it's not like the\nKavanaugh allegation and want it's nothing because there's nothing criminal about anything that's even alleged about Trump with Stormy Daniels or or I should say about his contact with her and people are saying was all the campaign finance that's pathetic than no no shot no chance um\nBut I got to say now I'm thinking you know is it is it ... why why do people jump to the conclusion that Trump actually has had this affair with her\nUm what what I said I shouldn't say jumping conclusion I think that's obvious but why are we so sure\nA lot of people in those seem very for sure about it I I'm I'm just ... I'm keeping an open mind there's ... there's never been any proof offered that I'm aware of\nMeaning she's never been able to show text messages or emails running at you know that that that relates to the affair she just gave this description of him and you know there's another part of this and I'm just thinking through this\nHer whole description of Trump in her book it's like she wrote description based on what she knew the media would want her to say which was just be really a ... and degrading and nasty toward toward the president\nSo I'm you know I I had thought that the president is was before he was the president I thought that maybe he and I had strayed from his marital vowed here and I was willing to say look\nI care about what he's doing as president and the political movement he represents I'm not I'm not sitting around trying to judge all politicians by every every action in their lives um bad especially because it's you know the only do that the only enforce that against Republicans they won't enforce it against Democrats\nBut there's also part of the things well you know maybe there's something else here it it just I I'm thinking about right I'm thinking about I'm not totally sold one way or the other but now they they they are all focused on the president referring to a woman as a horse race\nYou know I this is why I say Trump was winning and winning and winning this week in this feels a little bit like a field a little bit like an unnecessary distraction\nAnd and not something that I Would really want the president to say buttons that said\nMaybe when you're when you're this when you're this ... when you're in his position and you're fighting against everybody and and it's all an uphill battle maybe there is this going to be these you know is it's not they're not all going to be a hits right they're not all going to be great\nSo that that's a part of a Jew and maybe he's human which we all know who he is maybe he's imperfect which we all know he is a and I think that we should be able to have that chalk\nA tough on this but at the end of the day nobody wants to be the one that says that we got to spend less Republicans will talk about okay we can't tax more fine but the truth is we've got to spend less and that means we gotta spend less on Social Security and Medicaid or Medicare Medicaid\nThat's what it means that is what it means or else it it has no meaning and Republicans don't want to hear that and I know a lot of the folks listening to this than I have a tough time and that they feel like they pay it in and so it's not an entitlement if the government\nYou know making amends for taking money from them for all those years Social Security that's pretty much true we just use change the structure of a long term Medicare it's not true with Medicare your kids if you're listening to this really actually your grandkids if your Medicare age they're the ones and your great grandkids\nAre going to be paying the financial price for the care that people take it out of the system today\nIt's not right it's intergenerational theft and I know people don't want to hear it but that's just the truth\nMeanwhile the feds collective record income taxes\nIn twenty Eighteen so you know we're always told oh there's not enough there's not enough ah revenues there's not a ... no it's there's too much more than a rabbit or there's too much spending government has got to rein it in and in last\nWord you know we're either going to have a serious national conversation about this and take action we're going to suffer some really horrific economic consequences and by the time the consequences are obvious it's going to be tough to turn it around and that's just the truth I I'm a look we'll continue to talk about this issue because it matters\nBut I I won't harp on it too much talked to Ron Paul did it for a little bit that was interesting he served as a big lead ...

or twelve year old boy twelve year old anybody\nUm that's not cool that's not nice it's not fair and it's a on becoming\nSo I'm not commenting on a twelve year old as somebody with strong opinions and who goes home from school and cries about them that's that's not of any interest to me whatsoever with Israel interest to me is that that was a clip\nOf Maggie June ... all the actress on the

feel the need to come home and cry\nBecause that young girl met another girl who did not show described as a feminist is because the parents are engaging in a really relentless\nPropaganda campaign toward their own children now parents can raise kids with whatever believes they want but I I Would just note that\nI think that they're doing a disservice I think that anyone does a disservice to a very young person by ... really instilling and I'm a radical leftist belief and not letting them keep an open minded and develop their their own beliefs but\nI also think that increasingly parents these days and just adults in general in America who our lives who are liberals have absolutely no perspective on these issues that they have no ability\nTo stand back and try to be a little objective their purpose other kids and you know letting their kids come to their own beliefs and not feel familial pressure to take certain positions because even as an adult\nYou should always be testing and

and outcomes it becomes a no CBO effect\nSo called pandemic of opiate overuse may be seen as a as a no see the ... effect itself tonight and I'm going to be a spoiler 'cause I don't really give a damn about the TV show it's called ah the Connors\nAre used to be Roseanne on ABC Roseanne he said that in the show they were going to kill her off\nThere were a killer off the program I'm with an opioid overdose they did it they actually killed her off from\nAn opioid overdose everybody said how does how do they know how do they know they're trying to cover up the fact that she spoil it for everybody weeks ago and I basically had said well if you're following the Roseanne program she was actually are in need of a knee surgery and the show\nAnd she'd been taking pain pills from friends and others and having a stash around the house so it was a given\nThat they would kill her off by giving her an opioid overdose\nAnd see this is the thing that bothers me about the opioid the opioid problem in the opioid overdose and and the opioid overdose scares that they're giving everybody and that is if you are addicted or if you overdose on pain medications it's a moral failing\nPeople will have you believe it's a moral failing of propaganda will have you believe that you're ... you're an addict\nWhen you're not\nAnd so the killing off of Roseanne with an opioid overdose in my opinion is exactly what they were expecting is exactly what was going to happen and uh and that's why it was done\nSo tonight I wanted to bring on a friend of mine who uh I've I'm On the show we haven't had him on a

appreciate it and so so bad and I mean what is it with a propaganda ... world today making people who are using pills for paying give it get making them a treating them like moral a pariah I that's what they did when Roseanne denied they actually killed her off the TV show\nOr said she had opioid addiction and she died of an opioid overdose ... why are they\nDoing off ... for you not answer a fool according to his father you know people are so silly it's just ridiculous how we had this idea that uh we're okay to judge people or whatever their behaviors\nAre OK to cap aspersions on others or whatever their behavior is acting human body is hardwired to be addicted substances as hard\nWired specially can be addictive substances that are already inherent in it and actually opiates are they are analogs of bio chemicals that are already in your brain so when you take an oath and say that you have you have a pain problem and you take opiates an opiate tell what all immediately happen is your ... your brain will down regulate\nThe production of its own and dodging his BS and you'll in Athens become decision by taking artificial opiates you'll end up being the fission which we'll put you in a deficit state and if there's a there's a pills in Iraq right you have you almost impossible to reason\nNow I Know that I Know that we have a a sort of a psycho social context\nSurrounding the patient Dr relationship the patient farmers ... pharmacist relationship but yeah I I think people tend to ignore the fact that you know right now if you're using opiates you you become pretty much a ... you become a dark and NPR why we're what's that or\nYour award you're awarded the state yeah you belong said you belong to the medical model and that and they love that yeah well now what are you gonna do you're hooked on okay so you you have to go to the doctor you have to go to the pharmacist even if it even if it means Dr pharmacist shopping\nYou you're compelled to become to be a part of the model of the paradigm once you get on and said that once you get on the drug ... shut illegal drugs then by the way I tell people get that's how dealers and and a drug drug dealers gets you hooked on heroin\nWell and that's the truth or you know one of the thing I did a show one time about crocodile and it was interesting because uh I was talking about it was cheap heroin and that many people that look very attracted to use this cheap heroin\nAnd uh I was saying you know be aware of crooked deal because your kids may be using it and blah blah blah blah blah and boy did I have an education I had people calling me all over the country in their sixties and seventies\nSaying to me that they were addicted to heroin and that they are they're the ones that ... that the they worry about that the that uh they said you should be worried about grandma and grandpa\nOr have gotten their pain pills taken away from them and they have to resort to using heroin or they have to get heroin and they get it like a really low dose of heroin but if they can make cheap crooked deal in their kitchen\nIt'd be more than happy to do that you get rid of their pain and the stories I heard were heartbreaking stories of like a guy called me and said I was in a motorcycle crash and I was in a lot of pain and the doctors gave me my medication and one day they just decided we weren't gonna give it to me anymore and so I had to use heroin\nAnd I'm going wow you know and and I I never thought he was I always thought you know be where the kids taking drugs but no be where grandma and grandpa who aren't getting their pain medications because the doctors don't know how to treat the pain\nIt's a terrible situation is absolutely terrible situation they as you our talking before a lot of it is based on the fact that we've created a society we've created a culture that is conducive not not physical him it's a psychic pain to to access the actual pain and guess what opiates work on that too\nYou know it's not just work on physical pain they work on a spiritual hang on and I ... I Believe as a pharmacist that this is a really big part of our ... our addiction addiction problem is we are in hey\nWe are such as somehow locked in a culture that rule wars its citizens for being alive or just citizens for participating in society we live in a sick and just ... culture and our our addictions are just a symptom of it\nSo it it is is that there's something missing that doesn't that doesn't give us a I I like to use this raid the doping means squirt if you will\nI caught reward Delaney square is what when you get a hit a job and your brain does yes he like you won the lottery it activates the reward center in the brain and we are inherently designed by a chemically by our nature to have this this yet the feeling whatever we want tax\nWe get to get the feeling when we reach for the door knob and open the door or you get a little hit it don't mean so we we have lots of things that we're supposed to be a ... a lot of ways and we're supposed to be able to access just opening square as you say but we've created a culture\nThat that drives this and it's a habit and and the members of the members of the society to live in the early yeah let her [noise] so they have it in ...\nIt's trauma they they they induced the right amount of trauma for the right amount of time and people need to find\nThat hold is missing in their heart and their souls or like you say we were talking earlier about X. essential pain [noise] this is something very real and something that I think everybody should be listening to tonight just to let you know the Connors airs tonight on ABC have used to be the Roseanne show and is Roseanne and predicted that killed her off for using an opioid overdose\nWell now now they want to bring back ... be for certain types of uh\nThe depression so see ... D and mushrooms for people who are dying of cancer\nRight I I don't understand like I said ... the propaganda machines in the United states\nAlways seem to find a way to create a some sort of scenario or propaganda feed but they're telling people for the certain drug you're using it's a moral failing severe uses drugs in rural families you're addicted is moral failings\nAnd this is why we get

says what's wrong he says I said I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to\nAnd he said no give it a try and he says I'm a uses and and and he was a guy that it was just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try Canada's and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know some idiot ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about\nUm things like a cannabis that they ah let them use CBD Oil Somalia does it as an eight minutes on their joints an average ... ever since they've been given it or if they're giving it to an end brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a ... a a a a ... an opiate and so that's\nThe problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs to this country as such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places all over the world\nThey they treat or this type of a crisis\nNot with jail time and and punishment they they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest or they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated\nAnd and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and ah and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not\nFeeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help and they're in need of a ... there were needed medical care\nAnd I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities for specialized treatments\nAnd I think the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack or uh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you\nKnow everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people put them in facilities and have them is not going as criminals and be trained is going to be put into the position of criminals there actually put into hospitals where they were under a medical arrest\nThat would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people that have gone through this because the problem is bad and you can agree with me I Know that doctors do not know how to actually\nGet rid of pain that's one of the things pain is one of those things I said in the beginning but it evolves over time and you even brought up existential paying you brought up deep\nPain inside the body that is not pain that it's felt physically but it's pain that is felt on a on a I guess you could call on a conscious level or or your consciousness is he in pain are wracked with pain\nExplained al ... does work on that I hey they do\nYes absolutely that's why people do it I mean I I don't I Can't speak from personal experience but I Know that people ask spoken to many people\nWho say that they like things like tram at all and uh I don't know if you've heard of that is a similar to opiate similar to what ... ... or biking or Percocet because it makes them they say it makes them feel good\nAnd what they really mean is that it makes them it takes them out of their painter the pain of existence you know we we live our lives as as the roast that most people live their life was quite a sense of quiet desperation ... and like we get beaten down over time\nAnd that creates the sense of I don't want to be alive they said well you know what I mean\nOne of the scariest things one of the scariest things about opiates then I'll tell you this this was a scary\nFor me I remember when I had my first cancer surgery\nAnd uh I was given a pain mad I don't remember what it was I was in the hospital and all of a sudden I felt balance I felt no pain and I felt great because you know after you're dealing with the initial pain and you're feeling the stitches and you're and this is my got here and it's been caught you know you can't move because if you ... your core has been cut and you can't move\nAnd it was really weird it was a weird experience to have something that takes the pain completely away and you feel balanced and that's exactly how I felt when I needed the pain medication or to get rid of my pain and see that's the thing is it's the idea of the balance at times\nFeeling that balance when the pain will not go away and you have that balance of\nOf calm or you have that moment where the ... the the warmth Russia's over you and the pan is gone but like I said before there's dependence where you take that pain away because you're dependent on appeal to take the pain away and then when the pain is gone and you still take the pill that's when you realize maybe I'm addicted or maybe have an addiction to the smell\nTest your body down regulate that some natural production\nSo all of a sudden your decision you're out like you say you're out of balance what's really interesting to me why and how much of this stuff that we talk about sex or central ... for example could be related to things like inflammation inside the body\nFrom too much sugar Yeah Yup or outwardly sufficiency maybe we're not getting enough I think we know you take out of the diet\nCompletely one of the things that happened to get anxious to pry so maybe there's people are suffering from\nFrom the conditions for say they never teaches this stuff but now they they gave us the food pyramid but they never say hey you know what if you eliminate sugar from your diet side of the nation is going to go away just like that you were to lose weight you're going to feel better about yourself and that's how it's going to happen\nWhere we live in an empire quiet where the empire just as a U.S eating sugar and eating grains and eating fast food and eating and eating and eating so that a wealth can be created\nYeah we again it comes right back down to understanding our bodies are standing by chemistry and this is what I dedicated my life to helping people understand how their bodies work at a biochemical weapons or biochemical level at all up and that's what we need to be doing educating our style right at the age of the Internet information to limit\nIt should be much easier any way\nTo educate ourselves into how exactly our body where you're writing a main how\n... how much non understanding we have as individuals and the culture and even our authority how much not understand or health authorities hat\nHow the vice put together and how the body how the body work did you get your side of the polio vaccine apply here that most people out all the they'll tell you oh it's terrible that the U.S proud you know one percent of polio cases
