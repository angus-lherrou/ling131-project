{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "I'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm so I'm calling because I have just started to look into the Dave Ramsey program and I've\nCreated my budget and I'm trying to get my fiance on board with it uh he's somewhat on board but he's not all the way but my my question is is how do we work on baby step to pay off all of our debt while also trying to cash flow wedding\nOkay cool so how much do you have personally\n[noise] um well our\nFinancial together now they're not together you're not married okay just me I have about eleven thousand in credit card debt okay and that's it I Know how I have a five thousand dollar car mhm and\nI have about forty four thousand seven hundred and student loan\nOkay cool and what does he have\nHe has only a car a ... eleven thousand four hundred\nOkay and what is his income his income is about thirty eight thousand like what is your income about thirty three thousand seven when are you wanting to get married ones the wedding in September twenty ninth next year we'll crush you got to a much good\nOkay ... you are not going to be a hundred percent that free and pay cash for a wedding between the two of you with that income\nDo stash yes math but I Would like to do our best\nExactly oh I didn't want you to do poorly on just just observing that mathematically we're not going to knock all of that out yet so given the that's the situation when you have a modest wedding would you agree with that\nYes okay so when we do have help from his parents my parents oh good how much are they chipping in um well his parents are paying for the catering and the reception that in which the huge chunk of it yeah and then um\nThe venue is free and we're getting married at the Capitol Grounds so that'll be good and then um we uh\nMy parents pay for the draft and then they are paying for it I'm very limited free alcohol that will be there and okay\nPhenomenal good and so uh what do you guys need to put in to add to this\nI'm I'm hoping to stay around eight thousand for what for decoration I'm renting things like for that\nWent in and stuff like that and for our if you think that's too much\nYeah I've done to really really nice weddings with two daughters are like really nice things and\nUm I mean you've got the big dog in the wedding is the reception usually the typical wedding it's at least fifty percent of your budget usually yeah the dress and the you know the the camera and the venue is usually aren't hiring the preachers not usually that much you know our friend is actually doing it\nRight so so we've got you know we generally speaking really you've got the big things covered here um yeah you're probably a little rich just for leanings linens a lot of people have a really nice wedding the whole wedding ... okay and the national average is less than thirty\nOkay for and that includes radical jak Princess Diana type weddings okay I mean you know yeah [laughter] right so um\nMy mom always said I have um champagne taste with a beer budget\nYeah well I I kinda let me too that that's how I Want broke so [laughter] so if I'm you know it's not a big deal but I'm going to back that down in the spirit of\nWe want to get out of debt you know I I'm going to just make up a number you guys can adjust it your adults you and your ... you and your fiance talk about it okay we're both handy I liked him making thing I'm going to say I must say let them cover the stuff they're covering and you put in five K.\nDecamp are up OK okay you you could change it you could get for you could make it eight you can change it later okay but whatever we do I'm going to put that in the bank first\nOkay before you start your total money might go\nOkay it's going to go ahead and bank five grand between the two of you and I want you to do that um you know it\nSaid to save up for the wedding and then\nHey you know and I want you to do that in like too much okay perfect and then two months on when it passed by Christmas yeah we can do that okay and then we're going to start the debt snowball each individually\nDo not run your money together until you're married\nI Know you said you are it's a bad idea it's bad for your budding uh engaged relationship it's really bad legally\nBecause if something God Forbid happens and I believe me I've been coaching folks for Thirty years and I see things happen that aren't nice okay it's stuff like a car wreck or something weird okay and you just all kinds of stuff happens and if he has paid off a bunch of your dad and you're not married it's it's\nIt's a problem and that's really what setting up here so um the the other way you could do this since you've got a lot more than ... you could just attack your debt snowball and he could build up to five grand\nOkay I just don't want to make him pay for that all\nWell in a sense he's not because of the day we get married it's all combined mhm and so he's not paying for it we're paying for it okay if as long as it combines on September twenty ninth\nThere's no you paid for it I paid for it okay this is our money at that point right yeah because here's the thing if if he um pays off the eleven thousand dollars he should be debt free\nYeah and you guys ought to have the wedding\nAnd then we got you to deal with when you get to come home from the honeymoon and okay the actual gonna have Sallie Mae moving in your spare bedroom right well we already do I know what I mean she's still going to be there when you get out in the honeymoon they got to get rid of VIX you'll notice so the next year or two but we're hoping yeah the thing is just lay out a plan that both of you agree to\nOkay but please don't\nI don't want him paying your dad's okay it gets weird\nOkay I I absolutely I didn't see it like that\nYeah it's just possible downside is all there and upside is very little if you get to the point that he has extra money the weddings covered and he's debt free and he wants to pay on me that's just ... big pile of cash in on September the thirtieth write checks Georgia that okay\nBut then if something God Forbid happen that everything's still separated it between now and then okay and I'm so cool cool congratulations and we'll send you a wedding gift is called the book the total money make over hold on Kelly's going to pick up

never borrow money which means that some things we wanted to do we weren't able to do\nAnd you know what to do to protect us from doing some stupid stuff cause some stuff we wanted to do that we

I work with law enforcement when they're in the system they are convicted to maybe they serve ten years\nTime to come out there is at the pain or requests from ice you either turn him over to ice or release them into the community that's the only two options Andrew will not answer the question to me let me would be willing to release center out there and said\nHe won't answer the question that was given them an dissent is a dissent is was the one who is pushing him on that issue both candidates for ah ah for the governor of Florida\nAnd and trying to you know trying to get that last push here as we get very close and people are going to look at Florida they're going to say there is a bellwether state this tells you a lot about the direction of the country for the midterm election they're going to say that this is you know really\nUh depends if the Democrats win it if you and wins who is the uh mayor of Tallahassee another person who I don't think they're going to run him and twenty twenty but they see him in a young a charismatic Obama ask mold so a lot of Democrats very excited about about Gillum\nAnd it was a ... a socialist I mean he's pretty he's pretty open about he wants single payer and he wants to raise taxes on that he won't say that you'll ask them how do you have as a bunch of things and you know we'll find some way but just address was pushing them here on the issue of ice detained requests\nAnd notice a villain would not answer\nBecause what this really is the question about sanctuary city policies sanctuary cities do nots and now there's some variations year depending on which jurisdiction of the ... century city as a as a general rule do not\nAdhered to or do not on her eyes to ... what that means is when someone is already\nIn custody of law enforcement and immigrations and Customs Enforcement is informed that that person is in custody they send it to attain request if they want that person to be turned over to them for the purposes of deportation\nThey\nRefuse century city jurisdictions refused to do that and what this and just knows and he had been a prosecutor is it that means that there are people who are a danger to the community who are convicted criminals people who have served sentences including sometimes for violent crimes\nAnd local jurisdictions because of the politics around illegals and because of the pandering to generally the Latino community by Democrats\nJurisdictions will not honor these detainee requests which means that people who are criminals and illegal aliens get released back out into the general population and can become repeat offenders\nAnd this is really a question of do you believe\nThat law enforcement should work together you know I cannot think of another issue where if the FBI requested uh for example the FBI requested help from a sheriff or local law enforcement they wouldn't just knock it help they will be stonewall we refused to help you as a matter of policy\nRight and people realize that there's a lot of crossover there's a lot of ways unfortunately but it is true that even local crimes can get tangled up in the federal Web\nAnd so there are ... and just the FBI is viewed as a legitimate law enforcement body by most folks and so there's a lot of cooperation between those reading I here here's a verb example I work in the NYPD intelligence division I would sit in a city with seeded with pardon me a\nSuited with an FBI agents DEA genes or people from all these different federal immigrations and Customs Enforcement all these different agencies Ralston into gather because stuffed them come on my radar would also be on their radar and we worked together as a fusion center that's what I was doing that's my ... and of course also it\nOn the federal counterterrorism side in particular\nBut we understand that there's a lot of crossover law enforcement will somebody who is a drug dealer who's also illegal alien is causing problems for the law and multiple ways and one law enforcement agencies should support the other law enforcement agencies legitimate law enforcement functions\nWould give him is telling you without telling you is that he prefers lawlessness because it is politically advantageous\nHe won't say it but dissent is was right to push him on this one and this then goes to a a refrain that you heard a lot from a lap and I really hope becomes a huge problem for them in the in the midterms which is remember when\nA Senate race that I don't think nearly enough attention you got the beta obsessed media talking\nAll about how he's going to be Ted Cruz when now that just laughable but there's another race that maybe deserves a second look here at least for what it tells us about the Democratic party if not what it tells us about the\nPossibility of this race going for the Republicans Kim Strasser will join just not talking about what's going on in New Jersey she's a piece of on the wall Street Journal where she is on the editorial board\nSmiling at corruption Democrats tried to save Bob and then does months after his bipartisan as admonished Mitch\nA Kim great to have you back\nAnd it's great to be here All right what's going on in in the Garden State which I always feel a certain love hate relationship for the New Yorker what's going on up there\n[noise] yeah well as you said you know what's notable here is that ... the entire media has felt obsessing over Texas where those numbers look Ted Cruz is is that now like pulling away from paid off work\nAs a racist even within a smaller margin of error and in New Jersey where a Democrat Bob Menendez\nLet you mentioned um he was censored by his colleague rather launched by his colleagues back earlier this year I'm after she had been found to have accepted also get from a ... and now convicted felon who ran one of the biggest Medicare fraud on government an all time\nI'm not only was accepting a lot of gifts from this guy and knowledge under Senate Ethics rules but he was working on behalf of the guy to help them with his business interests in Washington including gone so far it's a lot of health and Human Services secretary on his bat\nSo um he he was actually indicted for this uh the the FBI ultimately I'm Sorry that department of justice ultimately dropped the charges after the Supreme Court\nThat changed the standard um on what it would take to convict him but he wasn't honest and he's now facing a very tough race against Bob Cuban Republican businessman who's been highlighting this and it it's really dry favor\nHow did you say there is a a deafening silence came\nFrom so many of the au Jared Kushner must have some shady relationship with Saudi Arabia I hear this people are media all the time and I say okay well what is it and then there's this has nothing there's all these whispers of corruption around Trump meanwhile Menendez who\n... whether people want to just parse out the legality of what he did or not what he did was gross and the guy he was associated with even grosser and they're just hoping that Bush has gone on for the Democrats\nYeah many Democrats are actually out there running a campaign focused on so called Republican corruption Nancy Pelosi that are actually handed out to her members a toolkit a talking point how they supposedly go after Republican corruption Trump and and all sorts of other\nIssues none of which as you said there is any real evidence for but in the meantime they just close their eyes of the in some cases actually are outright helping I mean look the Democrat that's why it's called called smiling at corruption\nAt the biggest superPAC out their majority superPAC helping Senate Democrats decided to re route three million dollars to help Bob Menendez in his race on my ... are taking away from even more important races for them or where they're trying to unseat\nOn and places like Trump won ... much trouble but in essence this is the Democratic party say hey you know what we're OK with corruption I have yet there's all trail of evidence that very clear in fact the senators on record saying that he engaged in corruption but we're starting to do everything we can return to office\nAnd I actually say that there are two areas where I see a tremendous boxing loving to one of them is on this or as on the notion of corruption as much as you pointed out is is a talking point against the Republicans but you have so many Democrats you start to think about all the Democrats that have gone to prison than the last oh four or five years for\nIncredibly obvious and very shady corruption and that never gets brought up in any of this discussion as I said there's always this vague oh Trump most you know someone starts telling me about the Mali months calls Kate I'm you know that that tends to be what I hear about 'em but also on on the notion of moms I I have to say I am I have been surprised and\nI take it very dim view of much of the of the journalists class which I Know technically you definitely are a journalist on something else but I'm pretty close to journal land\nBut most journalists I think act in a way that is really surprising to me but on the mobs Kim I'm seeing a lot of people would say you know they have no other they have no other way to make their case and these are people that write for the Washington Post\nIt's it's crazy look it's absolutely unacceptable okay the whole reason we have civil\nSociety we have to face it so that we don't have mob rule just because you're citing when an election just because your person didn't get in office or just because you lost your Supreme Court nomination there definitely nothing written in any uh\nFormal or informal holes in our society that give you the right to shape Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz added hound them at a restaurant\nUm it's in the back for spicy why we have a ballot box elections and anybody who's out there whether it's on CNN on there and well I Am not a ma and be they're just saying what they think\nWe all know that's not true I'm saying what you think is when you write in a letter to a newspaper or you go to vote\nBut you know harassing people on the street is not and that's the best and then conservatives should actually feel pretty good that they're winning on the policy marriage\nNow I Know that it's it's really tight and so to to ask you to make a prediction and who really knows but just in in a minute or so we have your Kim how to eat where what's the main dynamic you see right now in the house race that's going to determine whether it ends up being a Republican the Democrats win the day\nBut I think the most important thing which you are hearing like mainstream media is how different it is today than it was just three weeks ago okay we can already saying with complete definite proof\nJurisdiction here to speak up it was also done in a conflict so it was done on Saudi soil on Turkish soil so this is a diplomatic issue this is between nation states guy was not a U.S citizen now I Know he was a green card holder he was a permanent\nResident a lot of people focused in on that but he's still not a citizen or he held foreign citizenship show you know why is this\nThe president's situation primarily to handle you know why is it something where the president of the United states is the one guy who is supposed to take definitive action and we\nDo we know the answer the answer is that it's because the left wants to play this game of you know Trump is terrible and Trump is a dictator and all this other stuff or any loves dictators here's Obama's former\nPublic relations propaganda czar from inside the White House Ben Rhodes and this is how dirty he's willing to be played with five\nWhat we're seeing here Chris is is really the continuation of a profound re alignment of American foreign policy under Donald Trump\nWhere we no longer speak up for democracy and human rights we no longer speak up for a journalist and said we call them the money is at the state and we're getting a green light not just said this Saturday regime but to any regime around the world who wants to harm dissidents harm journalists because the most powerful democracy in the world is no longer on their side\nI think it has with Jared his son in law he's been sort of his vice Roy when it comes to dealing with the Arab world I think he feels that somehow he's in bed with this royal family over there that his sort of Romanoff phony ah family\nAh and their families seem to be locked together Jared yes it is and his crown prince seemed to be in bed together politically\nYeah ... ... ...\nOh my gosh I don't know why anyone I don't want any lessons that guy just so desperate to hang on and be relevant he must be good friends with the management MSNBC I don't know why people listen to their really don't\nKnow among one of the worst analysts on TV or a total I Believe it used to be a conservative to say whatever you have to say to try me relevant at any point in time\nBut you you had there are two different versions of giant bull crap\nA bull crap coming from Ben Rhodes is that this is Trump's fault that the ... the murder is because Trump calls CNN you know the enemy of the people\nUh I I hate to break it to you but you know there are a journalist there are propaganda apparatus sigh in countries where journalists are the enemy of the people straight up is the north Korean\nMinistry of propaganda the enemy of the north Korean people yes\nIs North Korean state media the enemy of the north Korean people whether the ... yes same thing is true in Iran is doing a lot of countries\nJust being a journalist does not give you some moral superiority which I Know is a shock to all the swamp dwelling journalists around me here in Washington D. C. and they really think that there's a national and they don't want anyone to tell them otherwise\nAnd this is always I always get the sense from all these journalists that this is the only profession they could ever even consider having you know that that the notion of showing up to a job and just doing something else to them once they once they tasted a certain level of success in journalism is just oh it's horrifying to them\nWork with the pleads again oh no many of them have never done that by the way\nThey go right out of right out of school right into some J. program somewhere and that's that's the path of anyway\nUh this is just idiocy though from roads and then you have this whole conspiracy theory about pushing her and ... of and Solomon where they could get cushion the Saudis are very important strategic player in the middle east right now that's a fact\nWe don't get to ignore that's a fact\nNew administration no administration has ever stood up to the Saudis any meaningful way for running one of the crappy as countries on earth despite all of its oil wealth\nNo administration no president including Obama who's battling literally vowing to the Saudis okay so everyone needs to just blow their role and chill out on this\nStopped making this about cheap partisan points against Trump that's all they want to do I don't care about this guy to show the they have a little more solidarity with them they would otherwise because he was not even a journal he's a columnist\nThe guy was an as an opinion writer for the now I'm not saying that means that you know anything as sort of happened to him but the way they're talking about it but it's like he's ... you know he he is one of them meanwhile as anybody ever writes that opinion column anywhere somebody that now get special treatment\nIn terms of the media's view of them I can tell you this much if it were a conservative who had been attacked I mean ... an American conservative Lebanon attack somewhere else in the world you hear a lot less outrage about this just the fact\nIt is just a if if it was someone who are critical of fundamentalist Islam and that was the primary attack that Islam in Saudi Arabia is a destructive oppressive tyrannical force and the Saudis took that guy out that say well\nYou know there's a lot of Islamophobia going on there I mean you know they shouldn't they shouldn't have murdered in but you know there's a lot of Islamophobia meanwhile if you've been bring up the ... was and this is a fact and Islamist meaning he believed in political Islam and was very friendly and cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood\nIs like your trampling on the man's great that's that's just telling the truth he was an Islamist nobody he wouldn't do not as if he were alive nobody denies it doesn't mean you should have been brutally murdered oh I I almost left out\nThat he also a ... they dress the somewhat up as a body double in his clothing after they killed him to try to create footage of him leaving so that was the plan they they were going to try to and they must not have known that the fiance was outside\nBecause they were going to try and say that he left in that they had no knowledge and ... they were going to disappear and that was the plan to disappear him and they are just really really dumb about it\nLet me give you a little bit of in jail\nAgency inside here in terms of what I what I learned when I was in the CIA about how foreign intelligence often operates there this is a little bit of an inside baseball for you to like that kind of thing\nThere are a lot of countries that are very effective their services are very effective at surveillance and at a certain you know the regime's security issues that that's generally what most intelligence agencies are\nTheir primary concern is ripe regime and keeping the people in power in power and stopping any threats against them most countries aren't really worried about foreign invasions most countries are worried about toppling from from the inside\nOrder the Mike it and the whole thing you know star really\nThat's what you say the the the guy that this is your every subject now like I Know people were saying oh you're so great but does anyone has any reporter ... from the big mainstream journalist outfits out there has anyone on the left\nOr or even in the ... the quote mainstream media is down in the middle journalists the big lie but they still couldn't do it have they ever gone to somewhere with Trump from like wow you're you're a political phenomenon Alexa which this country has probably never seen\n'em does anyone ever say that did they say he's a rock storming Trump's if they do it was a rock star Trump is a is some kind of super human superstar right but they would never do that and I'm not saying that they should I just want to know what the comparison between the two because when you take a look at it you can find very obviously that\nYou know they they buy into this mythology runs got ... ... says by the way you know always show handsome you so charismatic I I don't see it at all I don't and I and\nNone of it I'm like hey guys you know Kayla gay and you know it sounds okay and as the whole savings strikes me as kind of funny but I I guess\nThere's a and a myth a\nKind of mixing here in their minds of that\nRunning a person from a red state as a down home Democrat who can speak to the whole country and but also has that kind of youth and cool charisma thing that Obama had\nSo it's almost like the best of Bill Clinton the best of Obama politically speaking pulled together um and\nI think that is how they view which uh I think that's kind of the way that cause they're obsessed with\nThis guy and I'll tell you this and I've seen some other saying and I think it's true\nThey know he's gonna lose going to lose by double digits off until he could lose by by nine or ten points they think he's going to run for president\nThat they think that a lot of good enough showing in Texas the case will be they'll win all the blue states and be competitive in the red states\nHe can take on Trump and I'm here to tell you that Trump would crush him so badly he would leave [noise]\nI'm Joel NATO as a caravan of some seven thousand migrants make their way through Mexico towards the U.S President Trump Texas rally calling for

cool I'm French Jews princess we were gonna you know we must around with the parties so we're just pick it up where we left off [laughter] [noise] but see she went to it now she told me earlier she wants to be from the piece from the piece that yeah the ... that's me the prince to be [noise] um the ... the ...\nTo generate a contractor something snow but I mean did you ask her if she wants to Mm [noise]\nWell [noise] I guess not really\nOkay in case you didn't know that is a\nKind of public service announcement from Amnesty International which is an organization that apparently has a lot of time on its\nHands and Amnesty International thinks that people need to be told the fairy tale that there should be no uh no kissing women who are asleep this guy also this this it's a cartoon we played the audio from he kinda like reaches like he's going to do a little group group thing\nWhile this woman's passed out and you know this follows last week when you had Christian bell who is a celebrity a talent or does not strike me as very bright\nShouldn't have a fine actors I guess I don't know she kind of plays at a you know attractive youngest blonde female uh I I've never seen a really extend herself the man who cares I'm Out of that's being critic or a critic of\nThe attack a but she said that she's worried about what will happen to young women that she or people in general including her daughter I think she said\nWith a fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty who is just to wake her up from her dream because that there was a violation of could send that goes on there now I pointed out to you last week that\nThe the point is really not that there's that consent issue because they were talking about it which who has a magic apples and somebody's in a coma from eating the apple and it is a is a fairy tale\nAnd really the only way for her to be awoken which is the the storyline is by a prince to kiss her he saved her life by kissing her\nShow it's really almost like he's performing mouth to mouth resuscitation I Would say and therefore he does have consent if we're going to take it to this weird place where we are talking about this\nBecause if somebody is joking and you give the mouth to mouth resuscitation you don't have to say hey can you can you verbalize that you were choking and I'm going to give you or you know or they're ... they're hard to stop and choking as the Heimlich hard to stop you get the idea\nAh some mouth to mouth resuscitation you know in in a fairy tale is really what we're talking about here but they ran with this\nThey didn't stop they weren't they weren't it wasn't enough for them to just say I have an actress because there was another one I forget what another actress came at all I'm worried about fairy tales and the patriarchy so they're they're destroying centuries old stories\nThat is instill very basic one\nCreative sensibility and young people but also have some basic morality entailed so good and evil and their fairy tales they're meant for amusement I promise you I don't know a single guy who in college age was like well\nBecause the handsome prince ... just the girl in a coma or I could just this girl in real life you're like no one would ever think that nobody no human being has ever ever ever thought that\nSo this was a problem that did not exist but now they've gone even further with it and you know in that video I don't want to play it again for you because you've already heard it\nBut you know there's some very dirt first of all there's a curse and there's some\nAs they make it very clear that there's some kind of crude sexual humor in there as well you know referring to the initial that he uses and everything and he's clearly supposed to be in a title frack bro the ... I mean there's there's all the the patriarchy left wing stuff is there\nBut you know this is what the what the left doesn't yet grass is that they lose on this stuff they lose on these cultural issues where they\nAre acting like maniacs um and and this brings me to not just this battle over fairy tales and consent\nBut this whole ... this whole story that broke today about how Trump is uh taking is telling the D O D J now um that they should do this this is the story line at least a that trend\nGender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration now that is such a loaded

the presidential race I have\nNever seen there and like I say right now I think the Republicans are going to do very well\nTired of high taxes which we gave the tax cuts with us so much that\nThey want a strong military they want for sex wants safety they want security we give that the Democrats do not believe that the Democrats don't know what they're doing they don't know what they're giving I think we're going to do very very well in the rise yeah\nNothing Trump's right I think that we're going to pick up Senate seat something's going to be fifty five\nYou heard it here for fifty five Republican Senate seats by the by the end of this thing not quite the super majority of sixty although it would not be sweet\nMidterms going to be tight I mean a house rather intimate church going to be tight very very tight I I think it could go either way right now and it's going to be just a few seats that separate the Democrats and Republicans at the end of the day but Trump is incredibly\nPowerful voice in this whole debate and discussion I think that he's really making\nA very he's making the case very well which are the Democrats don't actually have an agenda or a platform other than\nTrying to restore the legal and cultural edit fish of Obama is some\nWild Trump is president and the ... they won't be able to do that so this is really just going to be much more a rhetorical battling much more fighting it out in the media and nastiness and it really is it is moms or jobs\nAnd Republicans need to hammer that home the point that I think they're on that and they're doing\nThey're okay is that they could be stronger on this but on health care I'm\nFurious with the Republicans because they don't have a unified message and because of a couple of very unreliable GOP senators we don't actually have\nA real achievement to speak of in a in the healthcare realm\nAnd Obamacare is garbage in Trump is allowing people to get out of the individual mandate but that and also giving states more flexibility in this but they need to be telling people what that means and what it does for them you know they are not effective messengers\nOn health care and that could be I really do think if if the Democrats when that when the house it's going to be because of that issue\nOn the Senate side however Ted Cruz versus a bet to old Rourke are no surprise here Trump is going out there to Stanford Stanford head and I just thought that this was a nice moment in your play play quip twenty as Trump's on his way to Texas\nThat anymore it's all bad\nTexas said that it had I had a very very nasty stuff\nIt was it was a very uh\nWatch it and we got together and then by the way very late have we last shot or it's only a white guy and then ultimately what happened\nWe bought it out [laughter] it was obvious\nAs we work together very closely I like him a lot I actually like I'm a lot of very smart guy he loves people to\nDo that in fact right now I guess they said they never say that if I can make them sort of miles is over a hundred thousand\nIs incredible the crowd all that's going to be reading Trump in Texas sang over a hundred thousand people have registered for this thing uh we've had some fun with the whole ... ...\nOn this show tonight uh but keep in mind it it's just yet another case study in the media malpractice in the bias that's pushing so much of what they do every day I mean this guy beta ... never had a prayer and get a chance\nBut the media just cried short thirty eight million dollars oh they're going all around this guy all in on it and I just feel like you know it couldn't be any more\nObvious they have very little interest in the fact that there is a much closer than anticipated Senate race for the sheet the Franken seat up in Minnesota\nYou know you'll you'll notice that not a lot of people not a lot of people in the media are are paying attention the fact there was a single digit leave right now for the Democrat in that\nIn that Senate race who's trying to replace the Frank and so you so you know the race where they think maybe they can get some big upset against Sen Cruz that gets all kinds of

Fox News with just over two weeks until the mid term President Trump rally Republicans in Houston the board of Texas Senator Ted Cruz\nI also saw over the weekend I'm always amazed at how many people that are supposed to have intelligence ... opinions\nAre are actually more on 'em and and I know that this is the thing that happens but I you know here's some guy named Wesley Lowery at the Washington Post he ... he wrote over the weekend after this Mitch McConnell saying\nQuote yelling and elected officials in public is protected First Amendment speech and it's pretty disgusting to seat journalists lecturing our fellow citizens for directly petitioning government officials like the ... brains clipped everything he said here as it is wrong\nIn in ... an hour ... yes it is is protected speech but that's irrelevant because they're protected speech\nWe're talking about here in a restaurant no one's saying the government has a right to come in and arrest these people but the establishment could say get out your trespassing this is private property\nThey have that right to you know the the left thinks that the first amendment means they get to say whatever they want an act however they want and nobody else gets to say anything about it because we're infringing on their right by exercising our right they don't understand this they have no concept of\nA of rights existing in parallel to each other you know somebody can say something really stupid about Trump but I can say that was really stupid that doesn't mean that I'm getting their First Amendment right\nIf I you know put tape over their mouth and locked him in a closet that's probably kidnapping but also it's that's negating their First Amendment right\nIf I refuse to give them a permit to speak in a public park when I get that permit to other people to speak in a public park because of viewpoints discrimination that's not respecting their first met right but at a restaurant no you don't have the right to go into a restaurant and act like a moron or any more than you otherwise you're going to a restaurant and play\nYour you know boom box which we used to have to remember we used to have those the eighties and nineties [noise] the boom box you remember he's\nCarried around with you I remember how cool you were in high school was almost directly correlated with how big your speakers were you\nKnow you want to big speakers then you were really cool I was a little speakers were much more cynically pleasing and people like why do you like little speaker spot\nAnd and one of the speakers there there was a guy there was a public pool that I Would go to 'em over the week or well not really public but a community pool whatever that I used to go to over the summer and there's a guy who's just show up there\nWith and he would bring every time he was there he would bring a little outdoor speaker with him and play his weird\nBuddha Bar lounge music and and I just think that that is structured in a truce weird thing to do like everybody else the pool wants to hear your music in the ... that's a bold thing to do to inflict I don't ever bring a Bluetooth speaker will use you can blast your music at a pool with a hundred people\nI think that's very very strange\nUm and I think that you know it's it's something that people should not do anyway back to Mitch McConnell what's going on here and this guy was Lee at the Washington Post is essentially a doesn't understand where the first amendment stops and starts and you see this from a lot of journalists which you think that people who make a\nLiving from the first amendment would have a better understanding of it but their understanding of the first amendment is they have special rights and privileges and everybody else needs to just deal with it\nUm but that's not the way that's not the way this is supposed to function that somehow this is supposed to go\nAnd for the Philly branch thing and it just say that we're giving comfort to white nationalism and we're uh I hate this talking point it's so vile it's so despicable and unfair and they keep saying all the time and it's just a way of shutting down any honest political dialogue\nWhich is why people like me and increasingly set of last six months you know what the Russia collusion thing now they know they can't win that you're just you're just\nGoing to see that same that same mentality that same insane tenacity\nAround an issue where they think they can destroy the president that's going to be a expanded to cover any number of things so that the the craziness that led them to believe that Russia collusion was going to bring down the president that same level of just was jar\nOr will now be on everything the twenty Fifth Amendment stuff the can front of people in restaurants because that was just the that was the place where you had the first real symptoms of ... from arrangements syndrome\nThe first major symptom was Russia is going to bring down the presidency it's really going to happen Trump is they Russians do general Russian pond where it's just a matter of time before we prove it and now you see that because that's just not going to work\nThere now pushing out into everything else and you're seeing the same and Saturday I mean the leap brains they're saying that you know it's it's not a big deal that people were yelling at Mitch McConnell and remember you know what I'm saying these people should be arrested what you're saying they're idiots\nAnd people shouldn't do this and we should be able to share that opinion without people so you get your your opinion that's destroying the first amendment no\nIt is not is not\nAnd uh I I just think that this is\nOne of these places where you know you either have principles you don't abide by the way I'm not skipping over we just don't have unless you're there were there were a bunch of people that were harassing Nancy Pelosi over the weekend too and they are total moron ths okay they absolutely should not should not\nBe given any respect or any you know approval from anyone I heard somebody say they were the Proud Boys I don't know I just know that there was a video of people so I'm getting over coal to my voice has been really shaky last week video of people who ... yeah that's right I called I did the show every day I don't miss the show when I'm sick 'cause I Love all of you so much and I can't\nI Can't skip a day in the freedom on\nUnless I have a work thing I have to do but that's where\nA but the people yelling Apollo see they've done nothing to help their cause and a lot to harm it or if their cause is and I and I don't know what their causes I'm assuming it's just anti left wing something\nBut the left you're doing their huge favor no matter who you are if you say you're on the right and I know some people are talking false flag I haven't seen any evidence of that\nIf you say you're on the right and you are screaming and yelling people in the left now you give them the ability to say oh see both sides are doing it when both sides are doing it but that one case will be magnified so those ... those who are banging on doors and young ... on the far left a huge favor\nI just saw the c._e._o. global verification network last week here in DC we caught up for a while I said hey mark how's business he's a business is great we've got companies large and small coming to us for their background investigations and vetting\nAnd I know why that is folks because global verification is a U.S based veteran owned and operated\nBackground investigation company wherever your needs are for your age are department or if you're going to be leasing out a property is somebody\nIf you need to make sure the person you are trends acting business with is who they say they are you want to us based company a veteran owned and operated company one that doesn't offshore data doesn't send your stuff overseas and really just act as a middleman taken a cut\nYou know I I really care and I'm On it and we're going to fix this and you see there's so much with the Democrats it's really\nA reminder of how the Democrats are operating in general right now and what they're doing is effectively to connect try to connect emotionally with people without having to put forward any of their policies to try and make it seem like they care\nA few uh off for you\nYou'll pay that's what they're you know I wasn't the only thing that Bill Clinton was feeling back in the day I I'm just saying I'm just saying a ... you know also\nGrapefruits in the grocery store or comes with no orbital things warble object but you know Clinton aside for a moment here\nIs a problem that Democrats have is the more people understand about what Democrats once you do when it comes to governance the less they trust government the less they trust Democrats with governance\nOkay so you have to keep that in mind\nAnd the more that we find out that the Democrats don't have any solutions less will listen to their oh I've got solutions talk solutions like what\nHow do they want to deal with homelessness the answer is they they don't want to clear the homeless off the street and tell them that you know and it's actually enforce vigorously laws because that seems I mean right now you can't do that\nWell if we're going to create a system for keeping people off the street and we have places for them to go that are meant to give them a safe place to sleep food to eat and help to get back up on their feet\nWhich we do as a country that we do it better in some places the others but there are programs that exist for that purpose if we have those programs we should also be able to say hey you can't sleep and leave and poop industry\nBecause that's what they're doing and it's not good for the people that are living on the street it's not safe it's not sanitary but the the liberal mentality is\nThat they don't want to enforce the laws against the less fortunate because they want to use the less fortunate as a political party or they want to use the plight of people who live on the street to say oh you know we need we need more funding we need more funding\nYou know look at the big mean Republicans with their tax breaks nobody is homeless because of Republican tax break\nNobody is homeless because of Republican fat cats doing you know private equity restructuring or something people lose their jobs I mean I'm not saying that's all fine but you know they they take it to this point and and the other issue is\nWhen you look at a mental health as a factor in homelessness um yes that's true but really what he means by mental health is is generally a addiction that's the primary\nOr the primary factor that you find with homeless populations all across the country putting aside this whole homeless by choice movement which is a new thing which is happening in this country as well people say oh ... too expensive I'm just going to choose to be homeless out but\nYou know I I Would I Would tell you that it's roughly Seventy to eighty percent of the homeless population is is the number that I Believe I've seen but don't quote me on it\nUm but it's a huge majority for sure of the homeless population has either a drug problem a drinking problem or a serious mental health issue very severe schizophrenia or any number of\nDifferent diagnoses and that means these are people who need help [noise]\nIn is not helping them to read them in the public square literally in the public square to engage in all kinds of you know human activity in bodily function and things that are unsafe and you know not the way that people should be living\nBut that means you're gonna have to have police in

need\nDark reddish brown the crimson do juveniles are typically appreciated pink according to a study published in Nineteen Ninety the journal Smithsonian contributions to marine sciences so they're really fascinated by the sea cucumber gave me the creeps we're always we're really weird\nIs that uh it got me thinking about second genesis and what's second genesis is is well scientists have set\nSome have suggested that there is there was a a there is was there was a second genesis but took place in the beginning in the beginning God created having the euro got also created and have been and have been in heaven and heaven and earth and earth and earth an earth meaning there were several genesis\nUh beginnings several different ones\nAh where\nThere's a fifty percent chance of of the life forms which opposed the norm and they do exist and sometimes they show up and when they show up we don't know what you call the window would do with them and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about but walk ness monster I'm not going to any of those things I'm Talking about things that you know you look at them and you get a second look\nLike this chicken that swim so it's a chicken feed is said chicken monster type creature that I have in my uh\nOh I have in my article today a\nBut when you're looking at the multiplicity of creation and you're looking at\nHow little diversity a multi versus unseen in the multiplicity the agents would call that underworld creatures from the underworld coming from nowhere like Debbie ... from you know stranger things or you know I don't know anything that extreme but still I mean stranger things called the upside down we called the abyss uh the\nOf creation and the creation myth that we here too are the ones that have been handed down through millennia and each what did you did go to ... hour the concepts pretty much\nWherever you look so scientists are speculating sciences are speculating that strange organisms that might be alien in nature exist on the planet and there isn't\nA very far jumped to suggest that stranger life exist on the planet that well you've never seen before and that if you were to blow up in the shadow biosphere\nLurks every monster and vital thing that no one even wants to see or or take on her have contact with there was another creature that I saw they somebody was kind enough\nTo actually send me a picture of this thing it's called the tangled in I don't know if you've ever seen a tangle and but\nI saw a tangle in today for the first time I never heard of a penguin in my life it looks like a mini Godzilla with armor looked like something from a Japanese horror film tiny thing it looks like a cross between an animator and armadillo\nAnd uh so he says well bring up the plight of course will apply to push the ... isn't terrify but I I think the penguin it's cute but it's also scary looking 'cause I have this armor all over its body and it kinda like conscious over like Godzilla looks like it could take out a\nA you know if if it was big enough or you could take out Tokyo that that's how we're to this to see that these ... we're creatures that nobody has seen before or they've seen them or they\nCan't identify but didn't know what they are and this is what I mean by second genesis these are things that\nYou know you've heard of unicorns yeah right well you know this is a lot different than a lot I think there's a lot different than that you know okay you know and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster this is beyond my band is beyond the flat with monster these are things that you see and you're going what the hell is this and it's something that's never been seen\nOn the in search of something that's never been talked about on coast to coast am nothing ... or you know I've talked about really the and I know about that I've seen and you know that ... this reminds me of the myths gave the movie the mist remember the ...\nIt was it was it novella and it was also a a movie okay and the idea that\nYou know that some quantum joke\nScience can beat us with dimensional theories that point to the possibility\nThat there are areas of planet wear the veil is thinner or\nThere's some extra dimensional vortex where a second genesis occurred\nParallel to our own and their locations throughout the planet which suggested to be the most powerful due to their position in the the appropriate ritual perform there by the right to fish it could actually be a cleansing moment for the planet\nIt could open the best new creatures could come out and take I mean we're being warned\nThat there are ... are portals that can be open through ritual or through the auspices of super collider is like CERN and those real into these can pass through in hot mankind and change the direction of the future\nAnd as I said you know the mist they had a project they're like ... it was called arrowhead you're ahead project and the whole catalyst for the story was a dimensional breach\nProject arrowhead actually creates this myth and rain and enveloped the small town and during the night large insect like creatures are seen and Tara doctor like creatures attack livestock and small pass eventually these creatures attack humans as well\nThose horrifying creatures from the film we're known as the great with orders and you can only be described as deadly spider like predators each about the size of a small dog\nAnd these creatures produce corrosive Web strands which burn through materials like coughing flesh and in both the book in the film great widower is simply killed their prey would they're acidic Web strands within the film\nThey also had the ability to capture and lay off hundreds of eggs\nIn the living human host\nThe eggs take about a data hatch and they multiplied quickly yeah\nThe looks of these creatures were terrifying and there were even some\nThat were the size of a human being Ruben ... remember the there was a show called mimic I didn't know that they'll Toro did the show mimic is one of my favorite scary movies because of the fact that this this Roach or whatever it is\nGets to me the size of the human and you get to see it looks like a man and black standing there in the subway but it's not it's a big mop like creature scary looking creature see when you're looking at these creatures in the midst are you looking in in in\nThe movie like mimic these creatures are terrifying and and and you know if they're the size of human being even worse than it was explained by the producers okay of the movie and then they said we based many of the creatures\nOn supposed a second genesis creatures that were proposed by science they were based on real animals but from an alien ecology admittedly dangerous wild animals from a more brutal ecosystem that we are not familiar with but still\nBasically just animals made of flesh and blood nothing supernatural about them okay but they are from\nA second genesis ecosystem\nThe brutal ecosystem is the same ecosystem that the scientists at CERN and when a guy by the majority rows\nHave talked about\nWith regard to opening dimensions and allowing these vile creatures in for study Jody rose is a co founder and chief technology officer of the wave\nWhich is the Canadian companies selling machines that he claims exploit quantum mechanical effects to solve certain problems hundreds of millions of times faster than traditional computers\nAnd rose is also the c._e._o. of hindered systems or kindred AI which is to sell the start up your founded with others that was back in twenty fourteen and he dedicated the whole company to delivering advanced tell operated autonomous robots but\nHis goal is within the wave quantum computers he wants to summon a tsunami of demons or aliens or whatever they are the equivalent he says to the old ones spoken of\nBy horror Arthur H. P. love craft so the concept of opening the dimensions for some love crafty and like creatures\nThey come through sounds very much like he wants to open the realms of where the second genesis took place and and\nI mean I played the the the ... before we talks about this I don't know if it's for air because I think he swears in it\nBut he says something to eat that he says well when I'm going to tell you is is that we have the power that we're going to bring things over but they're not going to be like us\nHe says alien you know or you know different beat me things that we're building are not going to be people they might be really smart they might be really good at all sorts of things but they're not going to be like us they're gonna be aliens they're gonna be I'm Sorry to say way smarter\nThan every single person in this room in ways that we can't even comprehend so this of course triggers a lot of alarm with people right I mean\nYou know one must says you know if you're playing with a guy you're opening up these dimensions you're unleashing the demon the little guy you know where the ... you're going to have to throw your holy water on it you're going to have to weigh about it and say by God it's going to do exactly what you say not anything else but see that it doesn't always work out that way right\nSo you're copying this attitude that something will happen if you don't mess with Mother Nature so opening up the wormhole letting these creatures through a very very very terrifying prospect\nAnd it's something that we really really shouldn't be doing what they're going to be doing anyway and so the question is what is out there that does not fit the mold that we can see that one day we do see and when we see it\nIt's it's it's just too much [noise]\nHave you seen anything like that [noise] I mean have you seen something I mean look [noise] I'm not asking you to tell me about something that's the supernatural I'm Talking about real monsters here I'm Talking about things that you've never seen before you can explain [noise]\nNow that it in my microscope at an insight yet I guess it was\nOkay hold on okay okay Barbie a NATO

to our house and inspect this way she doesn't have to pay out any more money to find out something that she doesn't already know or what have you but we have them we're going to be arranged you would get them to her\nAnd uh that we will get a logical scientific explanation now that doesn't hold where to go further we're going to uh probably have some goes to the theaters or maybe in some other investigators ... just going to do something demonic going on there\nUh but uh you know one of the things that we do on this program and we've done it many times is that we actually have to back the
