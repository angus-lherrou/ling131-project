{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "Right okay so if you came a\nYou know you'd be at about a five year plan if you were a little under two hundred thousand right thirty six thousand divided into two hundred thousand right it would be um six years roughly if you do the full two hundred a little over two hundred but\nSomewhere between one fifty and two hundred you could do it and about five years not counting getting raises and not counting saving even more that's the most I wouldn't want to go\nOh I don't want to wait much more than five years or to buy and I don't want to wait much more than five years out of your retirement system\nSo I mean whatever you're going to do I would try to do it in under that um but then so the point is you're sitting with a paid for property no payment in the world at that point right and you're making really good money and you're thirty something thirty one thirty two years old right and\nSo can you can you become a multi millionaire doing that absolutely you can okay is that what you just pay yourself a house payment from age thirty to age sixty you'd be a multi millionaire\nRight okay okay great so uh well go ahead and would you recommend maybe\nIf we did it might be a good idea to do maybe I hadn't heard time at and say maybe a little bit less\nIt's up to you if you're gonna go longer than five years I'm starting to get pretty nervous about it okay okay if you're going to be under five years and you want to do zero in your case you're still going to be very young and without a house payment when you pay cash for this house\nRight thirty one years old is very young with zero house payment young you got the income for the rest of your life to build wealth with I mean if you will just keep paying attention again pay yourself a house payment plus or minus a little you can be a multi millionaire\nOkay great thank you don't like Dave I appreciate your life\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah's whether it's in Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call I'm sure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that you know a a financial peace university and I have paid out forty thousand dollars in twelve month good for you and\nYes and I'm Down to just one dead which is a hospital bill that we've been paying for many years now and I with very small payments mhm and uh it's been offended collection and we've been looking at our credit report just making sure that all these deaths have fallen off\nAnd um it it turns out that hospital bill has fallen off of our credit report\nAnd because of that my husband has been a trying with the idea of just not adding that to the debt now and just continuing that men on payments or even not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems whether one is you actually owed them money so you should pay it\nYeah that's one problem the second problem is is that it's gonna come back to haunt you just 'cause they're not reporting it today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and reported that anytime\nAnd so right what happened what's happened is is the collection agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with is just not downloaded their files to a credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just a mark but a bad mark 'cause this is a defaulted\nThis is a bad bill it's not a current bill because they didn't offer you payments at the start they only offered you payments because you couldn't pay them\nRight and you owe them the money and so uh how much is the bill\nI it's less than seven thousand at this point\nOkay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to pay them the minimum wage and I would build up a you know a lump sum up three or four thousand and offer them that a sudden let's get it settled in full and get it in writing\nOkay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again\nAnd on top of that you owe the bill so clear the bail move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHello thank you for taking my phone call sure one time I have I have a question I Am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for tax shelter anybody [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option and I went I took his uh annuity out my thinking was take a lifetime monthly benefit uh-huh [noise] and so then when I went to uh Africa about it they gave me a several other options\nUm some of the other options for to take a fixed\nAnnuity monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no I neither one way to take another fixed and the lady with a nursing care home policy no\nOr another option but to take a tenure certain with which would be lower premiums and on your lap and then it went race could be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above\nUm uh so uh [laughter] the anytime you start weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and garages notice I didn't even ask what I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are when that's on the insurance\nWhat we call that his bundling and there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance for homeowners Richards together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and so that I smelled harassed and you have a good you have a good nose on your kid out [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you a check with an investment advisor like one of the smart vest her prose and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with this annuity because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving you less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home\nIt just was ethic but\nWhat made it even more important when you watched it on TV and I'm sure we're going to hear the numbers are massive\nThere were two women prominently featured behind Susan Collins now so often we hear that the public and party is a party of a bunch of old white guys\nWere you at three women featured you couldn't see I'm Joni\nErnst shoes off to the side but she was up there too but you had Susan Collins front and center in a very professional look I think she got a new hair cut too I'm sure she did you know oh it's all about image it's all about optics\nSusan Susan Collins up there on one side Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia Republican senator\nTo the other side Cindy Hyde Smith a senator from Mississippi right behind her so now you have this moment where we as conservatives have had the tar beaten out of us for the last three weeks\nBeing accused of being just the worst people in the world the party that does not understand women\nAnd you have a woman\nDelivering the knockout punch a woman who is known to be pro choice\nSo now you have someone that other women especially boy that was ... that argument that judge Kavanaugh is going to a destroy roe v Wade you have a pro choice women standing in front of the world talking about how Kavanaugh can't do it\nThat in fact that the the people that\nThe um the Democrats who are worried about tearing apart room v Wade years ago not only did they not do it they wrote the argument against overturning roe v wait\nSo you have brilliantly staged brilliantly written delivered for an audience that would then turn it into prime time response so after all of the theater\nThis week after all the circus atmosphere for the last eight days in Washington DC you ended with an epic\nFinish so bravo to you geo pay bravo to you\nAnd to the what was it five hundred plus protestors arrested today I think I'm not sure\nI think Spartacus got arrested today I'm not sure I think that that would make sense for him because that would be a good campaign commercial for a twenty twenty presidents he hopes for ah\nFor Cory Booker or should we call them sugar as I talked to\nGuys last night I found the or your books from some of the angry Democrats on the Judiciary Committee started going through their senior year books to say gee what was in your year book\nCory Booker had his nickname sugar and\nI don't know about you but I Lived in the New York New Jersey metro area where Cory Booker lived and went to school in those years in the late eighties and a book or\nWe called a cocaine was referred to as sugar so why were you sugar senator is there something you need to tell us and also the guy who said he had um\nGroped a young woman at the age of Fifteen in the article he wrote called a stealing second or something like that a book or a also had his senior quote was let's go\nAll the way\nSo Cory Booker has some ... to do but he may be got arrested today it's not really an arrest as we saw with Amy Schumer yesterday it's kind of like being scurried off to get your picture taken and then somebody pays fifty bucks you get a ticket and you go home or you go back to the protests\nBut there is so much to get to today so much I'm just so happy about this and we will dig into it but I Want to remember what sparked all of this\nAnd it was Donald Trump nominating Mr Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh and on the day when that happened\nChris Matthews the elder statesmen and MSNBC you have to wonder how much longer he's going to continue in his role\nOr Chris Matthews was on the air talking about revenge\nAnd I tell you all of this all of this anger towards anything Donald Trump does towards any nominee he brings forward all of this resistance an obstruction which started the day after Trump was elected\nIt's a dangerous thing for the Democrats it said when you go out and develop all of\nYour missions in life based on revenge\nThey tell you to dig two graves\nBecause you're going to be joining whoever you think you're going to take down remember this from June twenty eighth this year Chris Matthews on MSNBC following the announcement of the Supreme Court pick from President Trump\nSays it's time for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't read the vengeance south with four and a half weeks for that wants to go before the election they will not look very strong to their face and I think there'll be under attack\nYeah yeah that was a good plan wasn't it wasn't that Chris Matthews if you don't\nYou don't go after vengeance and he's talking about Merrick Garland he was talking about Hillary's loss ah I'll I'll tell you talk about backfiring\nBecause the way the shrill arguments came out without facts which was a hundred and eighty degrees from what Susan Collins delivered today they sounded like a bunch of people\nEspecially when you hear the chanting the chanting the nonstop shrill chanting it just great and great and great\nNow I I'd like to say this is a a\nA good sign for the midterms but a month in political terms is an eternity\nIt's an absolute eternity\nSo I have sort of a plan that I think the GOP should lay out in advance of the midterms that will keep the interest of those of us who are conservatives who wants to try and save the house although it's a really tough tough event to try and pull off\nTo save the house when the president or out of the other part when you know what happens\nWhen you get the house and the Senate and the presidency and the very next election the midterms history tells us it always balances out and the voters will give power back to the other party\nAnd said that while as a as Susan Collins votes I'm going to vote for him too so you know that that's a good thing right Mr President you won't come and do any more rallies in West Virginia against me because he's trying to retain his seat in a state that Donald Trump won handily in twenty sixteen\nA very very red state that if a Joe mansion did not support this nomination he would probably have a tough time so I'm sure there were some political horse trading they're kind of like the ah\nNebraska the corn husk or compromise that rock Obama used to get Obamacare across the finish line there's so much more to get to I Will give you a couple of other seminal moments from\nToday and also the protesters aren't done yet the protesters who are funded by some pretty big people yeah I'm going to throw the Soros name out there\nAre because one of the women who yelled at Jeff Flake last week a woman who got into the elevator and was screaming get Jeff Flake\nGet sushi works for yeah she works for a nonprofit social justice organization that has been funded to the tune of millions of dollars by one George Soros and CNN gave\nHer I think in uninterrupted five minutes of their time today to spell her guts and sell her story I'm Sorry we have to take the mask off these people and point out that this is a well crafted attack\nOn our way of life and our government will get into it but join the conversation\nYou know the number eight for for nine hundred bucket for for nine hundred to eight to five and the buck Sexton show [noise]\nTubes if the Supreme Court Maine

pat yourself on the back\nNot only did you make it but I think reason and logic and\n[noise] the system worked and it it didn't\nWork really well because the only one Democrat out of forty nine Democrats is voting to confirm judge Kavanaugh to elevate him to justice Kavanaugh\nOnly one out of forty nine that's not a good thing that really is not a good thing\nBut there is good news a new poll out of Fox that says are the things that are most important people in the midterms the number one thing\nIs uh the economy now number two is health care and if you paid attention today to Susan Collins or yesterday if you've been listening to\nPresident Trump in his speeches that these campaign rallies he is brought up specifically\nHow he wants to make sure the pre existing conditions are protected\nSo with the number one issue being the economy and the number to issue being health care the president a well he's already addressed the economy with the economy the economy's working it's bought off right now three point seven percent unemployment the lowest since Nineteen\nSixty nine and companies are now\nAre actually working to more people who left the employment world to come back to work they're trying to come up with new ways to get\nSome of the women who left to go have families to come back to work there are trying to get people to fill jobs in the manufacturing sector to come back to work there are\nThousands upon thousands of good jobs in both manufacturing\nAnd then the trades that are unfilled oh you have to\nDo is listen to what Mike Rowe talks about if you don't follow Mike Rowe on Twitter or Facebook or visit Mike Rowe works on the line Mike Rowe works all one word\nYou're missing out if you would like to have a career\nThat you probably never going to worry about being unemployed there are literally tens of thousands of jobs that are good paying jobs we're talking fifty\nTo a hundred and fifty grand a year and\nAre jobs you might need a little trade school for but micro works will show\nWere you how you can uh get a skill and then go to work and my puts out scholarships for stuff like that so uh check that I didn't mean to get off track ... also the fifth\nNumber one in all the top issues of what voters are looking for in the midterms to fifth thing guns because Democrats are going to try and make gun rights again a big deal\nAnd Donald Trump is a I think Donald Trump is throwing a couple of bones towards the people who are a kind of squishy on guns now I'm a Second Amendment guy I'm On a lifetime enter a member I'm a concealed carry

blood pressure goes up I could buy a pop tart into the shape of a gun and my sister would have a problem but the president has said he's going to sign something on bump stocks\nAnd if you are a fan of bump stocks than a I'm Sorry but um if there if it's illegal to own an automatic weapon a fully automatic weapon I think bump stocks are skirting that law\nAnd I think we could win points with some of those a hospital folks if\nWe would say bump stocks are are good thank you disagree with me convinced me that's just one of those things that this gun owners descent or a member is in lockstep with the president or so\nThat that's where I'm at All right that's a couple of things are going on today 'cause we still have a lot to get two for the midterms and I will give you my a plan\nHome title

I realized this GOP is finally starting to get his presentation act together you know the two women in the background\nThe whole set up was just perfect\nWell you sound like an old Yankee Republican uh that's what a what do you know in the past you know she she has been [noise] you know confusing but I mean today I got to give her credit card Russia just beautiful\nYeah I think she laid out a primary fishy case and why this guy deserved to be where he's going to be hopefully after tomorrow and why\nAll of the ... and hollering while it should not be listened to as a legitimate criminal charges but she also brought up I thought I really respectful case for the victim the alleged victim here not a victim of judge Kavanaugh but if somebody\nI I was showing Presley and and I'm not usually as Susan Collins fan so that's a good now did you have a bad jingle to share with us\nOf course I Do I get the worst you used to be the spaghetti ocean or commercial which one you gotta go way back for that that's neat round spaghetti you can eat what this phone spaghetti owes\nOh I I remember just out of spaghetti but now you remind them and then he ran spaghetti you can eat with a spoon\nA spaghetti owes [laughter] now\nYou're in Queens the mass and there's a lot of good Italian food and Massachusetts did your family ever ... have spaghetti os\n[laughter] I Know you get out and you know\nWe were not allowed to have spaghetti and it can my mother's like you're nodding spaghetti out of it can that's a good one lady I'm putting that down spaghetti of jangle\nThank you happy weekend thanks for checking in John in Pennsylvania also wants to give Susan Collins a pat on the back tests do do John\nHi how're you doing I'm gonna I yeah I Wonder I Wonder if say that I think one of the reasons why there's ... two or three of all is because it's a speaking truth to power I think that's one of the reasons why Trump is so popular with people because we're\nSo used to all these politicians to here say ... or something else you're never followed up all sounds good come up to election but when somebody actually scripture and our heart is you know Congress there's truth to power before Trump that was a pretty rare thing\nAnd I think she tapped into that drain\nBy you know ... some of the consistency is these people look at the television and they're just like you know like why are we don't want which is why would you go back to a party you know ten times where you know people will be drug the rage stuff that anybody would an ounce of comments parents\nJust have to say you know this is and the one thing I could say the media is so close and I hope these people never get to leave power look everybody goes that votes don't you go that these people vote that the media it a little drive him crazy [laughter]\n[laughter] it's a great point any jingle you want to share with us in bad jingle that haunts you\nIn a yeah when you just said that that other guy I was sick every one of my head which could have been that good stuff I guess I don't think it's around anymore it's just it's butter but it's not ...\nOh my God if you think is ... by it but it's not a long term memory summarized oh that's a good bad one\nYou know him and he always said to his wife is more famous than he is\nBut I Would argue that I think they're equally famous match slap welcome to the buck Sexton shows or\nMike what a night to be with you\nYou know it's a it's a little bit of history I have to tell you I Am grinning ear to ear tonight oh what a speech today from Susan Collins\nShoot a great job should reject look I'm sitting here with\nI work for a wife mercy and at the end of a long couple of weeks and I don't think it's illegal on on the radio to tell folks that we opened up a bottle of wine and I was telling her I feel your article beer and I just feel like we've all been through the ringer\nI Can't imagine what it feels like for the Kavanaugh's but we've all been through the raiders were very emotional and very important that we win this battle\nIt's it's vital that we go forward not just for the party not just for the president not just for the judge and his family but for what Collins laid out is the rule of law and and America is the legal system I think would have taken one and the guy\nHad we not going forward and I know we're not done yet\nI Know where we're not across the finish line for about another twenty hours\nBut it's pretty much a fait accompli isn't not math\n[noise] it really is and um you know the only thing is we've had every curve ball thrown at us in this process or I Do think that um\n[noise] America has to figure out a way to deal with our divisions and I think of course I'm a part of sitting on the conservative side as or you might but the I think that the the left has become so radicalized do hate filled and\nThey would justify almost any action to get the ends that they want\nBut I think the same\nA peace loving a kind of like the Democrats that you're that were grandparents for many of us who you know I have orange is the Democratic party my family\nI think those folks need to find\nA way to recapture their party because it's quite as me when I see the scenes of the Senate hallways over the last couple of days\nI think it's off the ugly and maybe that shouldn't maybe those people don't properly characterize where the Democratic party is but I'm I'm I'm fearful that actually is exactly where the Democratic party is that if that's the case every battle we face going forward is going to get worse until the American people decide that they just want none of that\nWell here's one of the things that I brought a mad and I have a question I I have a personal question I don't want to get to you before you guys get to the next year or the next can of wine or whatever you're celebrating with\nBut I Am nervous that this victory happened too quickly too soon because we've gone for weeks before the midterms and that's an eternity in political life\nCan we keep this engagement in the conservatives in the G O P to possibly save the house is there enough energy to drive us forward for four more weeks\nYeah I mean really if you think about it we you know the Supreme Court should be so separate from politics that shouldn't have implications on the election but because of what the Democrats did it is the number one issue in the election and\nUnderstand you're concerned about keeping the enthusiasm goes but we have to think about this if we as a party and were unable to make this happen and now that the filibuster is dead it just it just took Republican votes if we were unable to do this as a party then I Would be worried because I talked to many people around the country I've traveled to a lot of states\nI'm In too many people around the country over the same thing that if the Republican Party kids have to keep his promise the most important have its promises\nThen they just don't want to be a Republican anymore and I kind of shared that as well I kinda felt this is a moment where if my party just can't stand for something then I'm not sure I Want to be a part of it so that we have the opposite of that we have people who feel proud of their party they're proud of Mitch McConnell the proud and Lindsey Graham they're proud of Susan Collins\nI'm I sold it for granted Fox's are given a big huge hug and I've been a real critic of Lindsey Graham but like a lot of these people who hated down something we're never Trump per se and have come around because they see Donald Trump is actually keeping his promises\nI'm going to do the same for these Republicans who kept their promised that they kept their promise\nTo support a constitutional as a Supreme Court justice than we ought to applaud them for it I think actually our movement this coalition a coalition of Republicans and Trump supporters and\nConservatives most of that coalition or or conservative I think that there's great promise now more problems than I felt at a very long time\nWe're talking to match slap or I call them a friend you probably know him as the chairman of the American Conservative Union if you've been to see back you recognize him he's also all over TV even brave enough to go on MSNBC\nMatt uh if you want to tell me three months ago that I Would be doing exactly what you're doing praising Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins I would've said you're drunk match lap go home but that's exactly what's happened this is this is a little bit of a miracle ...\nWell let's talk about Mitch McConnell just for a minute you're I mean it was Mitch McConnell who deserves the credit for keeping all those centers together and we had the majority in the Senate and when a Merrick Garland was picked for the Supreme Court opening that was Mitch McConnell's doing kept those centers together he kept all of them together\nAnd that's why we're where we are\nWho you are a hundred percent correct he just around it\nCredit for that and he and now he deserves great credit for the fact that he has ... you know not done yet a\nTomorrow or will be the second Trump nominee tickets shepherd shepherded through the Senate and under increasingly difficult circumstances and I'm going to make a production I think we're going to have another one next year\nAnd a and if you thought this one was rupture sweat you get the next book is an excellent could be replacing a liberal and a and I think the stakes I think the charges will be even more outlandish and so it was the tactics\nWell I I Hope we have some lesson as you called for us to look for some kind of unifying moment and Susan Collins did as well I've been telling everybody go pick a Zell Miller's autobiography and read what Democrats used to be like\nYou know read about a guy who was a blue dog Democrat from the south who had reasonable approach is to a changing minds in different opinions and I think that's kind of the mold that the Democrats have lost complete touch with\nSo I I I'm pushing that in the time remaining that just quick question you'll have like five daughters you and mercy have five young young daughters\nWe do we have five daughters of to exactly right\nHow has this last three weeks been at the dinner tables in the ... house\nThat's a really great question because I've had a lot of pretty serious conversations with my two older girls one is a sophomore in high school um goes to a high school that's kind of a sister school to Georgetown Prep and\nThey all feel silver lined by the ah\nBy the treatment of these Catholic institutions I think there's a real unacceptable a talk about Catholics of their institutions which were disgusted about and I've talked to my eighth grader and I talk to them how\nThey have to be careful out there with social media and drinking and of course boys and you know all these little lessons of life which are really important to know but I also ah you know what happens at our dinner table a lot is because they see their parents on TV which they think is really a kind of like the big deal\nBut you know you gotta fight and I'll tell you what Brett Kavanaugh taught me this last couple of weeks that I wouldn't have thought ... was this type of person as well as I Know he's pretty he's pretty mild mannered you know these low key\nBut you know what he did when they went to what the character assassination he fought back he fought back hard and when we talk about the around the dinner table we talk about that because they see their parents being criticized at the end we tell them that we're proud of what we do and they don't have to agree with us politically when they grow up back to agree with us now by the way life is just mandatory\n[laughter] that would ever believe that they want [laughter] but we talk about\nThe need in a democracy to stand up for yourself and to speak your mind and I think for especially young women that's really important lesson\nWell it's important that they know they have that arrow in their quiver and also that it's not the first era you pull out every time you know and I think right having a show just that he waited until he had to go there\nAnd then he fought back I thought that was a very powerful time and I thought today how did it\n[noise]\nCarmen Roberts it appears to be a done deal you know senator changes their mind judge Brett Kavanaugh appears to have the votes to be confirmed to the U.S Supreme Court\nTo her and how is that Brett Kavanaugh will work ... less than ... ... in the Supreme Court\nMaine Republican Susan Collins explaining her support for Kavanaugh her announcement coupled shortly thereafter with West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin support for confirmation should give cabinet enough votes tomorrow Fox is Jared ... in Chicago a jury finds a police officer guilty of murder\nChicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was led away by a sheriff's deputy says bond revoked after being found guilty of murder too and sixteen counts of aggravated battery have a twenty four gene shooting up\nIt was where we suspect liquid McDonald's second Manassas\nBecause when it comes to the place was thought never saw [noise] well the budget\nStuff today his suit of my friends Michael ... income and do you live from that constitutionally protected free speech bunker in the woods of Delaware\nYeah I'm right here in the middle of the blue part of our state trying to make sure free speech freedom libertarianism and capitalism are going to thrive not just survive thrive we're talking about the day\nWe're talking about Susan Collins a speech that Lindsey Graham even said while Lindsey Graham I we talk if you will hear half an hour ago we're talking with match slap to the American Conservative Union\nOr you know Matt and he's the white haired guy you see on Fox and even on MSNBC or and and we're talking about the fact that months ago if you would have said Mitch McConnell Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham would be the three stars of the geo pay we'd all go get outta here go home you're drunk\nBut there we are and we're talking to you guys about today and we're also talking about horrible jingles because I'm trying to get some of the horrible jingles on my head and we've\nBeen reminded of some of the old ones like oh spaghetti O's and if you think it's butter but it's\nNot it's shift on George in Pennsylvania is checking in George tests due to my friend\nMy great great scene shedding here\nNo thank you I you know bucking I go way way way back to the early days of the blaze and now that we're both\nAre no longer at the blaze but this show is still on the blaze radio it's kinda cool you know it's kinda cool for us to all be together again so I'm really thankful for the opportunity what's in your mind tonight\nI hate the way we let the Democrats set the tone of this this they've tried to turn it into oh his ideas are radical are are not radical does wrong he's got bad ideas he's got that he is\nYou have to worry about how his upbringing and all that kind of stuff he's an originalist\nAn original is salvo civil law is in Turkey interpret saw the way it was written which was the whole idea of having along the first place when you have judges on doing that and rewriting law which you end up with because you end up with a committee\n... at a dictatorship dictatorship by committee but it's still a dictatorship they are making all new laws they're making who writes their reinterpret the ... the ... which in a in a totally\nTotally devoid of were originally started and we kinda weak they're going to be hammering on this we've got a week to turn this around and try to explain what an original list it does as a judge and the fact that it's exactly what the constitution designed was designed for\n... ... George or a hundred percent correct and part of this starts not just a with what we talk about between ourselves\nBut Dana Perino who I just think is one of the greatest people ever in media\nGain and she's fair to Dana tweeted out today that it we just don't understand our history and I contend that because we don't teach it we don't teach American history we don't teach the constitution we just finished was it three weeks ago was constitution week\nAnd I guarantee it the school's took the money to hand out the pocket constitutions but nobody had a real discussion\nOf the constitution no and uh I'm lax myself so that's why I carry one all the time\nAnd I think that if you get judges\nOn the Supreme Court who will follow this operating manual that's been handed to him and not rewrite the laws are reinterpret the laws are I I think we're going to be in a better place and I also think this this whole success of today\nIs only part of what Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have been able to do with the appointment of more judges that are getting confirmed in a record rate and I think what's happened there not just mad that cabinet now\nI think the Democrats woke up in the middle of this confirmation and when\nDo you have any idea how many judges Donald Trump is getting appointed we are screwed for decades and that's actually I think part of the anger so the\n... the ... the judicial was always designed to be the weakest of the three branches it was just designed as a referee on the court\n... well on the basketball court right there but they were there were designed to view the referee here's what it says if you have a disagreement about what it says we will re read it for you and tell you what the laws say they weren't they weren't there to\nAnd who are they they are the people called indentured servants right was shipped from ... to date on any of that and the car and they were caught and ... and nice to the city for seven years\nThe only thing between them and the blacks would dare dare term for each was for seven years\nI Love the fact that you have read this and you brought up the thirteenth amendment here which is so often quoted by so many of our ah friends who are worried about the repealing of the thirteenth amendments not going to happen first of all be where did you come from\nI came from a British on it and yeah I was born and raised British and it just ...\nOkay I ... where you from a British colony in the islands\nYes well I had the last number is ...\nAnd got dear well I got there by ... being ... from England to the door involuntary

nobody there [laughter]\nKnow I'm not supposed to laugh at this but I'm having a shot and Freud a moment Senator Lisa Murkowski explaining why\nIt's a novel and are not going to vote for judge Kavanaugh it's over Johnny\nIt's over and behind your are empty chairs when it was still a an important issue\nYou saw people everywhere as a matter of fact every senator within their desk today which

me give you an example of what I'm Talking about [noise]\nThirty minutes [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nDoes that sound like people capable of independence thought and then those you're thinking oh that was an isolated case no just few minutes later in the basement where the uh protesters had finally figured out the senators on coming through the main lobby they're going in the basement they were gathering there too [noise]\n\n\n\n\nIt just becomes like a strange church of protesters\nAre really strange church of protesters and I think these lost boys in mostly last girls don't understand the full issue they're not looking at facts they're only looking at emotions\nAnd it really is frustrating and then moments after that was captured Susan Collins was going in for the vote on cloture\nAnd she walked into the the uh same hallway where the robots where where these folks were and she was accosted by both protesters and reporters\nAre you how do you have an ... ... ... ...\nI Will be I Will be voting yes [noise]\nAnd see the final confirmation vote and I will announce my intention son how to vote later today\nThat was Susan Collins earlier today before she delivered that epic address tonight\nWho just some magical day and again I I go back to the discussion we had an hour ago in this very radio show if you would have told me earlier this year four months ago that Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins would be the three heroes\nThe salvation of Donald Trump's presidency and the Supreme Court justice I would've said you're on your mind\nYou need to put down the pipe but no that's exactly\nHow this worked out Susan Collins gave such a brilliant and measured address today\nI have to give you a little bit of a snippet of what she said talking about the process because she really gave a history lesson she give a lesson in law and logic and decency\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas been steady get fined for more than Thirty years why can only hope that the cabin a nomination is where the press has finally hit rock bottom\nAgainst this backdrop the SATs teen age to vegetables senator to decide what the constitution said ... percent to ...\nI thought that was brilliant and you know we're talking to match slap earlier and Matt said that he thinks next year\nTwenty Nineteen there may be another retirement on the Supreme Court and with that retirement it's more than likely going to be a liberal justice which means then the court with a pick from Donald Trump would swing from five for conservative\nTo liberal advantage to a six three\nAnd that is going to be too much for liberals to handle that that change in the ratio would absolutely make everybody on the left to go nuts\nAnd they would be a it'd be Armageddon for them be legal Armageddon for them so uh uh the the biggest thing I think Susan Collins did today in your argument\nThat she made her case was to talk about something that the left would not let us get through\nAnd that was the presumption of innocence that if you were charged with something you've used of doing something in this country if we don't hang onto the presumption of innocence\nThan it is all over for America as a as a civil society\nPrint son Senate venison since relevant to the advice and consent function when any accusation step parents from my nominees otherwise except\nFlurry

Davis coming up tonight who we've had on the program before she's a medium uh and also uh I guess if I could get away she's she's she is a person communicates the skull\nAnd she'll be on the program tonight we have Stephanie Phelps who would come on the program tonight and of course we have with is also a we have a\nA ... he didn't even ... and that's it and what is what is ... what is your mom death and he's written books about the crystal skull heavy not\nA he's he's one of the more experts on the crystal skulls he he works with him for a number of years you've written books he's a doctor and a a he has a lot to say about him I that's what I Would I think it'd be interesting to hear what he has to say\nOr even a drop that was good that that's got a job right now job you there yes I'm here\nAnd it's good to have you on the program thank you for being on the program with us we're here with the bill and of course the crystal skull or tell us about your interest in how your interest began in this in this subject\nWell it'd be again there's a very emotional experience ... and ... but it was it Nineteen Ninety four I met ... well at least I didn't know what it was but it turns out to be a crystal skull that somebody puts in my hands\nAnd disclosed eyes are asked me to feel that I started to cry like a little baby\nThat that was for many reasons to stop a ledger and he goes why would a girl up guys are crying is something he doesn't know what it is and it turns out to be a crystal skull and what's interesting because of those old time for the first what's called it was not a lot of that ancient or laws is a lot of information and\nYou may understand that I couldn't let go anymore that is how I started to search through wheat and then it ends up happening within that time develop any pistols calls route and so\nOn the Internet ... which was the first of all that it appears that Michel ... is the oil and have this fascination that one day I Would need an angel and just like ... to ... thousand seven bill and bill came\nFor the call president the coal organized and that is one I saw this call but in the meantime I've been studying calls and trying to understand and it was interesting what you were saying about the ... the black box a cute is that's the right name but I\nLike ... like you know\nYeah uh because the key words I think as soon as you start working this crystal skull as\nConsciousness yes and you were mentioning and that's absolutely true you also work with material that calls for a mother earth so it links and said the earth but it also linked into the fact that the ancient people\nOr putting information in a system as well the best systems are you a way about technology where you can put information as that is quite right do they use these ancient courts as a storage of information that'd be now try\nTo access you know a lot of the interesting things and that is if\nWe have not being very successful yes there are channels and that it isn't that are that is far more information and that they're still call [noise] so people are searching for how can you access even this information because then they will just call\nContains sellouts infiltration I remember a story of a I counted on which which a company was working with pieces of course and they were putting inflation into this tiny piece of artificial and crystal\nAnd they say that at the size of a ... chicken put almost whole library\nWell and you imagine\nAnd I was looking at the\n... how much information that can be ... ... no brain no human brain that can really get all that information so I think the reason why that are so many crystal skulls out in this wall nuns asked to give people the opportunity to train\nSo they can access information and crystal skulls so that to gather and this will be a very very important point to get it because piece to gather information that the ancient split it with a crystal skull\nAnd I think that's important it's very important because as you say or quartz crystal is a recorder it does ah maintain a or at least holds onto a ancient technology and each information and as you were saying you talked about the the black cube you talked about\nUh just what they used it for the use it as a transmitted ... the value of arc of the covenant was an example of a of a cue\nThe holy moly the simple example because you and uh they actually utilize the courts crystal crystal skulls of course I Love the mind simple another temples they were able to utilize these very artifacts agents these ancient technology but it's been used in the past that we have here in Studio tonight\nBill home and with his notes on the phone Dr John ... with us to talk about the crystal skull more information coming up\nAnd your calls her

in when I walked away from him move towards me\nSo for some reason I had this magnetic attraction to the schools is that it does that signify anything in your opinion at your magnetic personality

hands near it um it it certainly had the healing power and uh uh you know I remember when we first had the Shawna Roscoe in the studio I was not convinced that this will be anything you know worthy cause you to the school itself\nIs a visual thing okay and we will be doing a a ... will be doing a a a will be doing Facebook Live so you can see this but it it is a\nVisual thing or you have to see it to believe but first of all then to be near it is to feel it\nAnd that is the second part in many of you are not going to be able to feel it and then comes the idea of communication and experience in that comes with both internal ... feeling and spirit\nWhich of course you get from it and of course tonight we're going to also bring about the new technology with the old black cube\nSo we're going to have the best of both worlds here and building so grateful for you to bring this again into our studio and this time give us an opportunity to utilize both are true to themselves along with

you know the answer to all my questions and because they had told me that it was that even as scary as\nIt was magical and and I walked into the room and looked at it and it was just oh I mean it was

they'll think I'm doing something profound\nAnd they leave me alone because I don't see anything in this thing and I but you know just so the next thing I knew I so so I sleep 'cause I had this noise snoring oh have you know how do I get out of this\nSo slowly opened my eyes and they were saying that was wonderful\nThat was terrific and I said yes it was\nAnd they did did you hear it said uh he was an eight six do on a tape recorder and I said\nWhere did that come from thinking I was definitely a\nSleep and they said that's you know it's not it's not even my voice and they said no it's definitely you and what has happened as I thought I had fallen asleep I'm\nSo much of this information at pull it out through a couple of tapes without stopping and um\nI was totally freaked out actually\nWas you were to channeling your channeling a message to the school\nTo a that kind of situation\nI'm used to be sort of in control of the semi in control are giving my commission and allowing\nAt ... none of that has happened it was just boom\nAnd um that that was my first introduction and a semi seemed very happy because it started to give it its history and I was not happy\nAnd so okay it's goodbye we won't do that again right that again\nYou know what I I remember I was had been size once and I went through a channeling session and ah it scared me so much like throw away the tapes of the recording I look back and I regret that now 'cause I remember it was so amazing you know some of the things that are my boys did that my body did they have on tape and that just terrified me to the point where I didn't want\nI didn't want anybody to see it nor did I Want to experience that again but now looking back I'm thinking as I matured and I understand what this is an hour an hour to operate I I Belong back to the time when that happened to me and uh would which would have kept a recording of maybe somewhere out there somebody's gonna recording I've been recording some of my old shows\nBut it was something definitely the traveling aspects are are are really amazing what can be done through the human body for the human voice\nYes absolutely so that that was my first initial\nI'm meeting with the skull and um then\nThey asked me to go back like two months age I said no no no no no but and then sent me had started calling me which struck up a friendship and\nAnd she was saying oh if I wanted to see you Dale and to to come up and then when Sammy cold you jumped\n[laughter] I did go back a second time and I said okay I Know what you're about so I didn't look at it I kept my eyes off it and everything and ... and ... and he said well let's see what this guy has to say it's a day\nBut sit in front of me and I'm not looking I don't get involved and\nUm people that had come what kind of expecting something and I said\nI'm Sorry but I Can't I don't know how to do you know\n... it won't be anything channeling on command and starting to do well even though I may ask you to do it later so be ready to accept it either by hand on the scholar at the last thing I Would have\nBeen [laughter]\nLike [laughter] like [laughter]\nAnd so I said semi I you know I Can't do this and I can't do this anymore is it\nThis is a tricky for me and a look at all these things you said\nAnyway it went on for many many years and I they are being me I I like to prove it and I don't know if I told you about the storms so they had\nThis panel of experts come there was a physicist a scientist medical doctor and somebody else\nAnd they would be all out and touch me to she things and um\nTo see what happened you know it's basically this fraud if it was ... and I think\nAnyway they they during the session\nThey said the instrument you're working with um you told us that this could be used to control the weather so we'd like to see that demonstration and it said\nOh well [noise] okay storm so within minutes a storm that a lot of really bad stone\nAnd then it said stop stolen went away so\nWhen I came back they told me I thought well that's good that's that's some kind of proof the next time we were up there and said well that could be coincidence have them do it again so they asked for them you know just coach showed a storm again or do something\nAnd it said the yes control the weather right and that we have put my hand up didn't even\nSay anything it started to rain really hot and we had some sun lightning and a pretty significant that they took notes and everything will record it and uh and the\nScarlet had enough of it it said stop\nAnd it did within you know unusual amount of time minutes with a set time [laughter] it cuts Carroll said yeah\nThat could be coincidence to you know this guy that\nI mean and that's one of the reasons why I Love you so much is because you know well you know you talk about you know these experiences you also weigh in coincidence you where you and the practical nature of it all your very or you have a critical analysis\nEven of your own work which I think is amazing Terrell Davis were to take a break and then like I said I'm gonna see if we can get you to communicate with the scope tonight maybe in parts some wisdom to was from the school on the program tonight so it'd be nice to hear that from you speak to Colonel Davis with ... one of my favorite people I always say that 'cause I every time I talk with er it's like I just enjoy\nWe would also inform you that the planet it still is in need of the staple ...\nBlows areas the with in\nThe universe a planet coming close

travelling or was it just something that came through you and were you able to ascertain some definite things that the school was trying to tell us\nIf you'd have to repeat to me but I think\nThat's what I was thinking about is why I have a\nBoy I have to clear something out of the way because otherwise I and I have a ... a message for you and I realized in public and I'm trying to\nPut this ... trying to change that would because they just and\nSo they have a message directly for me\nFor you to really yes\nWell go ahead and tell me what the school bell thing when\nYou are and age it's very

I'm clouded than I Do it on purpose when she wonders why do this and I think it's\nBecause I'm afraid of are expressing hall or what I feel and what I Know\nBecause if you express it sometimes that leaves you up for scrutiny and ridicule wouldn't do and it's not always easy you know when you're trying to\nUh you know do a talk show and you're trying to keep some credibility you try to because

that should be taught in government classes and law classes how to give a winning argument\nIt just was ethic but what made it even more important when you watched it on TV and I'm sure we're going to hear the numbers are massive\nThere were two women prominently featured behind Susan Collins\nNow so often we hear that the public and party is a party of a bunch of old white guys\nWere you at three women featured you couldn't see I'm\nJoni Ernst shoes off to the side but she was up there too but you had Susan Collins front and center in a very professional look I think she got a new hair cut too I'm sure she did you know oh it's all about image it's all about optics\nSusan Susan Collins up there on one side Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia Republican senator\nTo the other side Cindy Hyde Smith a senator from Mississippi right behind her so now you have this moment where we as conservatives have had the tar beaten out of us for the last\nThree weeks being accused of being just the worst people in the world the party that does not understand women and you have a woman delivering\nThe knockout punch a woman who is known to be pro choice so now you have someone that other women especially boy that was ... that argument that judge Kavanaugh is going to a destroy roe v Wade you have a pro choice women standing\nIn front of the world talking about how Kavanaugh can't do it that in fact that the the people\nThat the um the Democrats were worried about tearing apart ruby ... years ago not only did they not do it they wrote the argument against overturning roe v wait\nSo you have brilliantly staged brilliantly written delivered for an audience that would then turn it into prime time response so after all of the theater this week after all\nThe circus atmosphere for the last eight days in Washington DC\nYou ended with an epic finish so bravo to you geo pay bravo to you and to the\nWhat was it five hundred plus protestors arrested today I think I'm not sure I think Spartacus got arrested today I'm not sure I think that that would make sense for him because that would be a good campaign commercial for a twenty twenty presidents he hopes for a\nFor Cory Booker or should we call them sugar as I talked to\nGuys last night I found the or your books from some of the angry Democrats on the Judiciary Committee started going through their senior year books to say gee what was in your year book\nCory Booker had his nickname sugar and\nI don't know about you but I Lived in the New York New Jersey metro area where Cory Booker lived and went to school in those years in the late eighties and a\nBook or we call a cocaine was referred to as sugar so why were you sugar senator is there something you need to tell us and also the guy who said he had um\nGroped a young woman at the age of Fifteen in the article he wrote called stealing second or something like that a book or a also had his senior quote was let's go\nAll the way\nSo Cory Booker has some ... to do but he may be got arrested today it's not really an arrest as we saw with Amy Schumer yesterday\nKind of like being scurried off to get your picture taken and then somebody pays fifty bucks you get a ticket and you go home or you go back to the protests\nBut there is so much to get to today so much I'm just so happy about this and we will dig into it but I Want to remember what sparked all of this\nAnd it was Donald Trump nominating\nMr Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh\nAnd on the date when that happened Chris Matthews the elder statesmen and MSNBC you have to wonder how much longer he's going to continue in his role a Chris Matthews was on the air talking about revenge\nAnd I tell you all of this all of this anger towards anything Donald Trump does towards any nominee he brings forward all of\nThis resistance an obstruction which started the day after Trump was elected\nIt's a dangerous thing for the Democrats it's\nWhen you go out and develop all of your\nMissions in life based on revenge they tell you to dig two graves because you're going to be joining whoever you think you're going to take down remember this from June twenty eighth\nThis year Chris Matthews on MSNBC following the announcement of the Supreme Court pick from President Trump\nFish has time for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't read the venture yourself with four and a half weeks for that wants to go before the election they will not look very strong to their base and I think there'll be under attack\nYeah yeah that was a good plan wasn't it wasn't that Chris Matthews if you don't if you don't go after vengeance and\nHe's talking about Merrick Garland he was talking about Hillary's loss ah I'll I'll tell you to talk about backfiring\nBecause the way the shrill arguments came out without facts which was a hundred and eighty degrees from what Susan Collins delivered today they sounded like a bunch of people\nEspecially when you hear the chanting the chanting the nonstop shrill chanting it just great and great and great now I I'd like to say this is a a\nA good sign for the midterms but a month in political terms is an eternity\nIt's an absolute attorney so I have sort of a plan that I think the G O P should lay out in advance of the midterms that will keep the interests of those of us who are conservatives who want to try and save the house although it's a really tough tough event to try and pull off\nTo save the house when the president or out of the other part when you know what happens\nWhen you get the house and the Senate and the presidency and the very next election the midterms history tells us it always balances out and the voters will get power back to the other party\nSo for the geo Peter retain house would be a little bit of a miracle but I have a plan and that will share with you I also want to hear your thoughts on today if you have any thoughts on that it's friday let's have some fun\nAnd I have a really\nRidiculous question for you\nI Know the other day I asked a question about what's the what was the scariest movie of all time and a lot of you came up with great answers well today I reached maximum\nAnger at the worst jangle ever and I know you've heard\nJingles it doesn't have to be a current jingle it can be an old commercial jingle one is the worst jingle ever you know it's an ear worm it sticks in your ear I'm going to give you money you want to call in with yours and you can sing it or you can ... you can say however you want\nBut when I hear one age seven seven times for kids I Won a stab my radio\nOne age seven seven times for kids and then they say donate your car today they don't say donate your car today they say donate your what the hell is done neck\nAll right that's my crazy thought for the day if you have a a thought for this Friday a celebratory thought as we get into a great weekend hopefully hopefully twenty four hours from now we'll have a new justice\nOr give us a call a for for nine hundred Bach aid for for nine hundred to eight to five Mike oh Palca and for ... bucks X than show\n[noise]\n\n\nYou want to be smart when you're hiring you don't have endless time

... it's just that\nAnd then there was a massive round of applause for very long round of applause and the Senate\nIt was a very emotional day and I'm sure it was very emotional for people on the other side and you know it's an interesting immediately following the announcement of Susan Collins we had Joe mansion running running to hand the press\nHis statement that he is in fact going to also [laughter] I it's almost\nToo funny and then you hear this morning mansion called the White House early in the morning\nAnd said that well if a Susan Collins votes I'm going to vote for him to some you know that that's a good thing right Mr President you won't come and do any more rallies in West Virginia against me because he's trying to retain his seat in a state that Donald Trump won handily in twenty sixteen\nA very very red state that the for Joe mansion did not support this nomination he would probably have a tough time\nSo I'm sure there were some political horse trading they're kind of like the ah Nebraska the corn husk or compromise that rock Obama used to get Obamacare across the finish line there's so much more to get to I Will give you a couple of other seminal moments from today and also\nThe protesters aren't done yet\nThe protesters who are funded by some pretty big people yeah I'm going to throw the Soros name out there are because one of the women who yelled at Jeff Flake last week a woman who got into the elevator and was screaming at Jeff Flake\nGet too she works for yeah she works\nFor a nonprofit social justice organization that has been funded to the tune of millions of dollars by one George Soros and CNN gave her I think in uninterrupted five minutes of airtime today\nTo spell her guts and sell her story I'm Sorry we have to take the mask off these

Happy Friday you made it pat yourself on the back not only did you make it but I think reason and logic\n... and [noise] the system worked and it it didn't work really well because the only one Democrat out of forty nine Democrats is voting to confirm\nJudge Kavanaugh to elevate him to justice Kavanaugh only one out of forty nine that's not a good thing that\nReally is not a good thing but there is good news on a new poll out of Fox that says are the things that are most important people in the midterms the number one thing\nIs uh the economy now number two is health care and if you paid attention today to Susan Collins or yesterday if you've been listening to\nPresident Trump in his speeches at these campaign rallies he is brought up\nSpecifically how he wants to make sure the pre existing conditions are protected\nSo with the number one issue being the economy and the number to issue being health care the president a well he's already addressed the economy with the economy the economy's working it's bought off right now\nThree point seven percent unemployment the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine\nAnd companies are now are actually working to more people who left the employment world to come back to work they're trying to come up with new ways to get\nSome of the women who left to go have families to come back to work there are trying to get people to fill jobs in

Rowe talks about if you don't follow Mike Rowe on Twitter or Facebook or visit Mike Rowe works on the line Mike Rowe works all one word\nYou're missing out if you would like to have a career that you probably never going to worry about being unemployed there are literally tens of thousands of jobs that are good paying jobs we're talking\nFifty to a hundred and fifty grand a year and\nThey are jobs you might need a little trade school for but micro works will show you\nHow you can uh get a skill and then go to work and Mike puts out scholarships for stuff like that so uh check that I didn't mean to get off track all also the fifth\nNumber one in all the top issues of what voters are looking for in the midterms to fifth thing guns because Democrats are going to try and make gun rights again a big deal\nAnd Donald Trump is a I think Donald Trump is throwing a couple of bones towards the people who are a kind of squishy on guns now I'm a Second Amendment guy I'm On a lifetime man or a member I'm a concealed carry weapons permit holder I'm a believer\nIn getting trained and being sure you\nKnow how to operate your firearms and keep them safe but I also understand there are people who are

and instantly her blood pressure goes up I could buy a pop tart into the shape of a gun and my sister would have a problem but the president has said he's going to sign something on bump stocks\nAnd if you are a fan of bump stocks than a I'm Sorry but uh if there if it's illegal to own an automatic weapon a fully automatic weapon I think bump stocks are skirting that law\nAnd I think we could win points with some of those uh ...\nIf we would say bump stocks aren't a good thank you disagree with me convince me that it's just one of those things that this gun owner the center a member is in lockstep with the president or\nSo that that's where I'm at All right that's a couple of things are going on today because we still have a lot to get two for the midterms and I will give you my a\nThe

tonight was used to be part of Massachusetts but that was one of the greatest duration tried for it and I'm just real happy and that's all I can say\nDid you watch the whole thing\nYeah I watched it\nYeah I did you hear me talking about how I didn't see it first I listen to it on the radio and then I watched it later I was more impressed after it when I watched it because I realized this GOP is finally starting to get his presentation act together you know the two women in the background\nThe whole set up was just perfect\nWell your show like an old Yankee Republican that's what a what do you know in the past you know she she's been [noise] you know confusing but I mean today I got to give her credit card musher just beautiful\nYeah I think she laid out a primary fishy case and why this guy deserves to be where he's going to be hopefully after tomorrow and why\nAll of the ... and hollering while it should not be listened to as a legitimate criminal charges but she also brought up I thought I really respectful case for the victim the alleged victim here not a victim of judge Kavanaugh but if somebody\nI I was showing Presley and and I'm not usually a Susan Collins fan so that's a good now did you have a bad jingle to share with us\nOf course I Do I like the worst you used to be the spaghetti ocean or commercial\nWhich one\nYou got to go away for that that's neat round spaghetti you can eat with us for spaghetti owes\nOh I I remember just oh spaghetti as but now you reminded me than any red spaghetti you can do with a spoon\nA spaghetti oh now\nYou're in Quincy mass and there's a lot of good Italian food and Massachusetts did your family ever live have spaghetti os\n[laughter] I Know you get out and you know\nWe were not allowed to have spaghetti and a cat and my mother's like you're not eating spaghetti out of a cat that's a good one way of putting that down spaghetti of jangle thank you happy weekend thanks for checking in John in Pennsylvania also wants to give Susan Collins a pat on the back test pseudo John\nHi how are you doing I'm All right yeah I Wonder I Wonder if say that I think one of the reasons why there's ... to go a cheerful is because it goes to the truth to power I think that's one of the reasons why Trump are so popular people because\nWe're so used to all these politicians just here said he wants to be doing something else you're never followed up all sounds good come up to a lecture but when somebody actually scripture in our heart is you know Congress there's truth to power before Trump that was a pretty rare event\nAnd I think she tapped into that they\nBuy you know ... some of the inconsistencies these people look at the television and they're just like you know like why why why would you go back to a party you know ten times reader people will be drug to raise the stuff that anybody would outs of common sense\nYou know am and he always says his wife is more famous than he is\nBut I Would argue that I think they're equally famous match slap welcome to the buck Sexton shows or\nMike what at night to be with you\nYou know it's a it's a little bit of history I have to tell you I Am grinning ear to ear tonight oh what a speech today from Susan Collins\nShoot a great job should a great job look I'm sitting here with my wonderful wife mercy and ah the end of a long couple of weeks and I don't think it's illegal on on the radio to tell folks that we opened up a bottle of wine and I\nWas telling her I feel your article here and I just feel like we've all been through the ringer I Can't imagine what it feels like for the Kavanaugh's but we've all been through the rigors of very emotional and very important that we win this battle\nIt's it's vital that we go forward not just for the party and not just for the president not just for the judge and his family but for what Collins laid out is the rule of law and and America is the legal system I think would have taken one and the guy had we not gone forward and I know we're not done yet\nI Know where we're not across the finish line for about another twenty hours\nBut it's pretty much a fait accompli isn't not math\n[noise] it really is and um you know the only thing a is we've had every curve ball thrown at us in this process uh I Do think that um\n[noise] America has to figure out a way to deal with our divisions like think of course I'm a part of sitting on the conservative side as or you might but the I think that the the left has become so radicalized so hate filled and\nThey were justify almost any action to get the ends that they want but I think the thing a peace loving a kind of like the Democrats that you're that were grandparents for many of us who have orange is the Democratic party my family I think those folks need to find\nA way to recapture their party because it's quite as we when I see the scenes of the Senate hallways over the last couple of days I think it's off the ugly and maybe that shouldn't maybe those people don't properly characterize where the Democratic party is but I'm I'm I'm sure that actually is exactly where the Democratic party is that if that's the case\nEvery battle we face going forward is going to get worse until the American people decide that they just want none of that\nWell here's one of the things that I brought a man and I have a question I I have a personal question I Want to get to you before you guys get to the next year or the next can of wine or whatever you're celebrating with\nBut I'm nervous that this victory happened too quickly too soon because we've got four weeks before the midterms and that's an eternity in political life\nCan we keep this engagement in the conservatives in the G O P to possibly save the house is there enough energy to drive us forward for four more weeks\nYeah I mean really if you think about it we you know the Supreme Court should be so separate from politics that shouldn't have implications on the election but because of what the Democrats did it is the number one issue\nIn the election and I understand you're concerned about keeping the enthusiasm goes but we have to think about this if we\nAs a party and were unable to make this happen and now that the filibuster is that it just it just took Republican votes if we were unable to do this as a party then I Would be worried because I talked to many people around the country I've traveled to a lot of states\nI'm In too many people around the country until the same thing that if the Republican Party kids have to keep his promise the most important

just becomes like a strange church of protesters are really strange church of protesters and I think\nThese lost boys and mostly last girls don't understand the full issue they're not looking at facts they're only looking at emotions\nAnd it really is frustrating and then moments after that was captured Susan Collins was going in for the vote on cloture\nAnd she walked into the the uh same hallway where the robots where where these folks were and she was accosted by both protesters and reporters\nHow you ... have you ever find out how to do on that cap\nI well the I Will be voting yes\nOn ... the final confirmation vote and I will announce my intention signed out to vote later today\nThat was Susan Collins earlier today before she delivered that epic address tonight who is just a magical day and again I go back to\nThe discussion we had an hour ago in this very radio show if you would have told me earlier this year four months ago that Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins would be the three heroes the salvation of Donald Trump's presidency and the Supreme Court justice I would've said you're on your mind\nYou need to put down the pipe but no that's exactly how\nThis worked out Susan ...\nGave such a brilliant and measured addressed today I have to give you a little bit of a snippet of what she said talking about the process because she really gave a history lesson she gave a lesson in law and logic and decency\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas been steady get fined for more than Thirty years\nWhy can only hope that the cabinet\nNominations it's where the press says that's finally hit rock bottom\nAgainst this backdrop sat T H ... vegetables senator side what the constitution that if I can send an email\nI thought that was brilliant and you know we're talking to match slap earlier and Matt said\nThat he thinks next year twenty Nineteen there may be another retirement on the Supreme Court and with that retirement it's more than likely going to be a liberal justice which means then the court with a pick from Donald Trump would swing from five for conservative\nTo liberal advantage to a six three\nAnd that is going to be too much for liberals to handle that that change in the ratio would absolutely make everybody on the left to go nuts\nAnd they would be a it'd be Armageddon for them be legal\nArmageddon for them so uh uh the the biggest thing I think Susan Collins did today in your argument\nThat she made her case was to talk about something that the left would not let us get through and that was the presumption of innocence that if you were charged with something ... of doing something\nIn this country if we don't hang onto the presumption of innocence than it is all over for America as a as a civil society\nThat prints venison since relevant to the fight consent function when any accusation apart from the nominees otherwise six cents blurry wreck\nI worry that part of its print sentient could lead to a lack of public faith and the judiciary and with these huge damage to the confirmation process\nLiving for over some of the allegations levied against judge cabinet illustrate why it hurts sat in a sense is selling\nFor it I Am thinking in particular not of the allegations raped by her pets are for but if the allegations that plenty what nature jets cabinet ... girls\nAnd use their week at a state that sell it to a gang rape\nYou know what's the most amazing here is it when you think about it\nThe apple collect the behavior of Democrats\nUltimately helped confirm judge Kavanaugh and most importantly the absolute insane charges brought by Michael Avon not he the guy that brought us Stormy Daniels or maybe she brought him to us\nBut Michael ... who tried to make this all about himself and his delusional dreams of being a twenty twenty presidential candidate ... brain for these insane charges that were debunked within twenty four hours but still repeated by the mainstream media\nHave a

Paris at public statements stepfather\nYeah she's talking about the media should go after the ... too much you go to Susan Collins could have taken the media part but what she did was make a well
