I didn't think south to answer that part of the quite variable Newt mutual fund or variable annuities are mutual funds inside of an annuity if you pretend like the mutual fund as an investment in the annuity is a coat that goes around the investment to keep it warm from taxes\nOkay okay and you pay extra for the annuity portion of this discussion or did you could buy those exact same mutual funds with less fees without the new to cope wrapping around them okay\nSo what is the new the coke do for you the coat wrapping around it to keep it warm it does the same thing the fact that it's an an IRA already Dutch so you're buying to coach for the same kid\nOkay okay you see what I'm saying you got it's already going to be kept out of the cold of taxes by the fact that you're rolling it into an IRA\nOkay then you move it into a new the inside of an IRA it's redundant\nBecause you've already got the protection now the only thing the annuity we'll give you is they'll give you some guarantees a along the lines of you know if it goes down in value you know they protect you on principle and it will give you at least a four percent or five percent of income but if you're invested in good mutual funds and you're young you don't need those guarantees\nSo I'm okay and truthfully not not trashing thrive in I mean driving her friends of ours are good people um but I Would not use that product there and the thing you need to remember about variable annuities versus a direct mutual funds sale\nIs there's two things going on usually usually if someone's trying to show you that because they don't have a securities license they only have a life insurance license\nOh okay and that it's a way they can make such a way in insurance person can get you into mutual funds is through the variable annuity they cannot sell mutual funds directly unless they have a securities license\nThe second thing that you run into that region you run into this and it's less often for this and I don't think that would be the case with thriving is that they're actually doing this because the commissions on a variable annuity are about four times what they are are on a regular mutual fund\nOkay so some people ... just because they make more on them\nAnd I would not accused the particular guy of that and the situation I mean knowing his from knowing the setting that you did this my guess is he's probably not security ... that's my dash okay and and he is still giving you a bad recommendation\nNow he did say that I can do that neutral fan exactly as you recommend and has using him he just really kept pushing the variable annuity and asked\nMe to go home with all the numbers have my husband review and think about it but I wanted to call you immediately I knew what you are going to stay already\nYou know so now we've got another problem OK okay if this piece of advice was bad and you knew it what about the next ... by that you don't know is bad\nI you're right that I'm ... I'm ... I I Try to listen\nTo my diet right away I just felt bad 'cause he goes to our church and that you know network\nYeah no that's okay I mean it's that you don't have to do business with people at church is not necessary so and so I I I don't think I'm going to do business with this guy a because I mean I I I don't like his advice and I might not like it next time I might not understand next time and so\nI just get a smart restaurant row and\nMoving that way juries are gross our major sons direction\nThanks for the call and this is that Iran should show [noise]\nTo come to the production officer for the date rape show\nTo make sure you watch it live just visit Dave Ramsey dot com slash show each day my\nFocus is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for their new routines well while you were in preparation mode think about this was the last time you checked on your financial plant\nYou heard me or do you even have one\nI listened with a financial plan and blaze you're more likely to reach your investment dolls and the best place to start is by sitting down and talking with an investing professional our smart vest her program helps you quickly find the only professionals in your area that our team personally worked with\nAnd look on oh meeting with a broken feel intimidating especially if you don't even know what to ask them\nThat's why we created an interview guide with a list of questions you can print and bring with you to make your conversation stress free to download your guide to go to Dave Ramsey dot com slash questions to ask that Dave Ramsey dot com slash questions to ask\nDe da de Los Angeles soon as the Patriot am eleven fifty broadcasting throughout the south land and all over the world on my heart radio [noise]\nVowing to find the culprit I'm Lisa like Sarah Fox news President Trump called on the country to come together after a series of packages containing pipe bombs were sent to high ranking Democrat and CNN's New York offices\nAnd the rest of the game and we will want\nUh whereas many obvious observations as I can despite the fact that\nThis is you've just people are losing their minds about the politics on this I mean they're they're so vicious and nasty and a desirous of attacking\nOne another as human beings and as people on and doing so with the most vitriolic terms they can think of a this is obviously a political discussion as well it's\nGoing to be reconsider I consider and tell you it look later on the show up Joe Jones joined us these ... D walkers through everything we know about these bombs I had a little bit of bomb training myself back in the day and the CIA so ... will also dealing with terrorism investigations which often involve\nA bombs in IDs so we'll walk through that component that but but the overwhelming focus of the media\nIs already\nAre going to be about assigning blame and uh and settling scores you're quite honestly and and making sure that there is a maximum political impact and you you just heard\nThat statement from President Trump he says there's no place for political violence in this country and Jeff Zucker over CNN CNN's one of the places where they had this suspicious package and they did all their coverage today from outside of\nCNN and a ... year Jeff Zucker released this official statement from CNN the\nPresident of CNN released this ... ... ... you know President Trump had already said what are the audio that I played for you of you know there's no place for for a political violence in American society none or threats no that's the president says\nHere's how the president of CNN response\nQuote there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter though so far they have shown no comprehension of that\nThis isn't just disgusting low blow from the president of CNN that's what this is this is it's the president's fault that some lunatic this is the president of CNN saying it's it's the president's fault the president's words\nThat are tied to this in some way right away without even knowing without even knowing who this is or what the real motivation is\nThis is the this is a disgrace\nAnd there's no shortage of this rhetoric coming from people now they they view this as a means of getting even with Trump now you know\nAnd they also view this as wiping away what had become a very powerful narrative because it was so true that the left is a bunch of screaming mob ing maniacs\nNow they're going to say oh it's both are now now the the the entirety of the Democrat power apparatus and\nAll of its all of its media wings which CNN is certainly one of them are going to claim victims status over this all the way up until election day before we even know who did it before we know anything about what they've done and you know I I'm Sorry but I Do not remember\nDo not remember the head of Fox News or the head of you know it and forget about the head of anything I Do not remember ah the the biggest names in the business that I Am in\nRush Limbaugh Sean Hannity or you know Glenn Beck I I Do not remember any of them saying oh it's it's the fault of CNN for example it's the fault of CNN that a Bernie Sanders supporting lunatic\nActually shot Steve ... and he almost died and tried to shoot a whole bunch of conservative members of Congress\nBecause of their insane rhetoric because of their ... they've been calling the president of the United states oh trader a Russian huge a crazy person a rapist or racist white nationalist effectively a clan member\nAnd they said he's destroying the country he's undermining our institutions someone must take action someone must do something about this\n\nAnd here we are here we are\nAt a point where finally there was a moment where the Democrat power structure feels like they are under threat and I I Am the ... I you know I Am consistent on this you do not hurt people hit people attacked people or worse because you don't like their ideas you don't do it\nNobody should do it knowing justified and doing it it's disgusting\nIt's illegal it's immoral and it's if you really are a true believer in some ideology at least in America right now it's truly counterproductive because right now\nIf you\nTake those kinds of actions your entire side but I'd have to bear the consequences so to speak so it's it's wrong and and and evil and stupid on every level\nBut if the Democrats who have been trying to blur the lines for the last six months or so and if the Democrats who have been saying all those things about President Trump since he became president\nAnd as I've been telling you if you really believe that we are descending into fascism as a mainstream left wing writers will have been saying if you really believe depressed the United states is a threat of starting an unnecessary nuclear war if you believe those things\nThen taking extreme measures does not seem like such a leap does it they have not been\nPushing back on Trump for tax reasons they have not been pushing back on Trump's for you know health care with any of the same\nVigor and seriousness and ferocity as they have on all these fantasies that they have conjured around Russia collusion and twenty Fifth Amendment of Trump is crazy and he's going to start a war\nAnd now\nAnd now they want to pretend that oh it's it's Trump's fault that this happened and this is right from the very top this is right from the top of the Democrat left wing power structure in the media Jeff Zucker himself\n\nGeoff my assistant is going to be overheard by a friend of mine declaring that CNN has declared war on Trump that's right that happened you have ...\n\nNow I can sit here and say without any feelings of\nOf ah she position is that\nMy criticisms of CNN all stent\nCNN is a dishonest news organization that is pushing an agenda that age furthering division in this country that lives about the president addresses it up as news coverage and that has a lot of coddled babies like Acosta and others\nWho refused to accept that you know if you want to be taking all kinds of shots at the Republicans and the president maybe they're actually\nGoing to criticize you back with words with words there are allowed to do that\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I can also sit here and say I am happy to hear that no one at CNN was hurt\nThat I have friends including some very dear friends who still work at CNN and even if I hated everybody CNN which I don't I Would still pray for every single one of them to be fine and come out of work unscathed and go home to their families and I do feel that way and I know you feel that way too\nBut there's something deeply wrong there's something\nUnseemly and unethical about immediately trying to make it all well you can still criticize us and hope that we're okay you can't condemn these bombs being sent to us but also\nContinue to criticize us no I I I can and will and it's not just seeing that it's all these other ... you know it's it's George Soros is doing the funds incredibly destructive\nIncredibly destructive programs for freedom and for liberty in America I mean he he he is behind a lot of very bad stuff\nUm and then when you out of you know then you add into this also obviously the the Obamas and the Clintons of people who are ideological opponents\nDoesn't mean that I hate them I don't\nRespect the Clintons but I've had I disagree strenuously with the Obamas I don't really respect the Clintons but that's a different thing I've lived in that respect but that doesn't mean that I Would ever advocated violence against any political figure anyone for their beliefs for that\nMatter but not not even a day passes not\nEven a day passes for us to deal with this issue to figure out who's behind this to figure out what's going on or without it\nBeing used right away in the most obvious fashion to score political points but I was going to say the Democrats think this is the way they can actually then ensure they win the house and maybe stop a a red wave in the Senate that's what they think this is that's what they are using this as\nA month and they brought this on themselves I'm not saying that this was a false like let's say any of that I'm just saying they're leveraging this for political purposes right away\nRight away shamelessly shamelessly rubber she squeezed was actually bleeding out\nOr something like that my county board of elections plus size seven seven seven fat or protecting legislation for them I guess I have a ...

... your sample ballot provide that information from Montgomery County board of elections selection\nMotive to assume anything at this point but we do know what all of the targets have in common these are all targets that had been criticized mercilessly by right wing outlet by fringe groups on the Internet and\nBy some right wing commentators and already there's this awful rush to try to claim it's a false flag operation figures like Rush Limbaugh who have a lot of power well a lot of influence well a lot of fans are out there saying awful thing but as you said it's a matter of leadership presidential leadership\nIt could be a false flag we don't know what why is it all\nI mean it's well they say it is because you don't know right so that's not to say it could be\nIt could be\nDemocrats plenty of big hate crimes are this is this reminds me of when people say that women have a right to be believed they never lie well no actually there are women lie about sexual assault allegations and then you write off a number of prominent cases and not to say that everyone's longer ones not lying but everything is judged on an individual basis\nCould there be a false flag going on here yeah of course they are good oh of course there are good wires that beyond the pale did this could change the election for the Democrats but notice I'm not\nSaying it is ... and I don't know we just don't know you had a ration attacked the media barely even better than I later someone send rice into like Matt is on the White House or the Pentagon\nNo that was a story for about an hour ... so\nWe ... what what are they really say you're out to all of the whole ... thing there what do you know I must say we're not blaming anybody interest all the right wing people criticize these people and that's the only thing we know about them so excluded the right wing sport that's that's what you're really to take away from that playing this game of ... we're not jumping to conclusions but he was a conclusion\nThat's what the left is up to hear a this is inherently a very political issue\nAnd I and I know that look this is a serious issue and nobody should be no should even bother no one has been injured yet either so let's also let's let let's not let's not back results into we can't even talk about this oh my gosh you know the ... there's a you know the bodies haven't even been very you know once you've been harmed yet\nSo we should feel free to talk about this issue without feeling like we're being disrespectful to the families of the you know we want everyone to be safe we want everyone to be okay\nBut this is in the heat of the political campaigns do so yeah this is an issue we are going to talk about this left his already trying to shape this whole thing though to their advantage is just so they don't want anyone else to do any of that so no one else can be political Democrats [noise]\nBecause they are victims of this of course\nThe\nUse I'm Kathleen Maloney [noise]\nDemocracy is at a campaign\nRally in Wisconsin tonight President Trump condemning the standing of suspicious and explosive packages too well known Democrats across the country\nThat's mostly fiercely oppose\nProsecuted investigators\nThanked the packages were sent by one person or group because they have similar markings and characteristics all were safely intercepted news of these

Jerry well is it the New York stock exchange the Dow dropped six hundred eight point this is Fox News [noise]\nFifty [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs that is that [noise]\nThere is no disputing that the targets as\nThese particular devices as we've been reporting so far are all connected to individuals that the president specifically and his political allies have been attacking\nThese are all people who have been or perceived to be critics of the president who have been the subject of his criticism very directly\nIf you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and people are going to act out and there's no human being more responsible for the climate were and the Donald Trump\nThe president and his allies they need to dial down to the political rhetoric they are making people less safe they are making journalists last day and they're making law enforcement officers let's say\nLet's remember we have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraged violence against the media\nBut there's an obvious to read the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN um George Soros these are people and organizations that\nThat's an in from continually attacking will demonize those\nWho I Believe the heated rhetoric that toxic environment\nIs part of this\nYes we are in an era now where violence seems to have licensed by the president of United States so all the president's fault you see almost everything\nThat goes wrong in this country according to the left is Trump's fault\nIf someone is a in a high profile sexual assault case it's Trump's fault if someone says something mean to someone somewhere it's Trump's fall if someone engages in a hate crime or says something racist somewhere it's comes full these people are nuts\nThey have really lost it ... you know that they're\nInto this whole the Jake Tapper Trump is demonizing them oh as if the media doesn't demonize the president and those around him by the way we CNN makes it very clear that\nThey will not be happy until ... some of the top people in the White House or arrested him and they want them to go to prison that that's clear from their coverage they want to see them in cells the left doesn't just want something along the ...\nPresident they want him to be ruined and destroyed their concocting narratives to achieve that they're not just hoping for\nThey're trying to make it happen I've talked to Carter Page I've talked to Papadopoulos talk he's got\nThis whole thing is we're still is about Russia collusion it's insane\nAnd what does Russia collusion really at its core what does it all about Trump is a trader that's what they're telling Trump is guilty of treason that's what they're saying I'm not making this up I'm not exaggerating\nPressing United States is a creature according to meet you and me the he's a traitor according to Democratic Party with no evidence by the way none\nAnd they want to talk about demonizing place\nOr I Know we don't often take that many calls here because I get so much of a city we have every single line late and I know there's a lot more people that are waiting to get in and I want to hear from you on this so uh let's get to it a first up Tim in Phoenix welcome to block section show\nAll tied in my ... trend\nShe'll time and this group is this what was going well how are you\n[laughter] you buddy a woman I said well you just do this also like to sell the just over the head as it's not all but but it sounds like\nThe last in the media and I'm not saying it's changed sitting on their on camera ban\nSame I had a little bit of a soft on the little stuff down here you're you're saying that this changes the narrative away from damaging things for the Democrats\nYou that\n... that just as that is true it does do that so there's no question about that they'd much rather talk about this in Trump's rhetoric and how bad he is and then I mean the caravan was a loser for the laugh which they didn't figure out until too late and and they're still hoping that everyone just forgets about what they did know Kavanaugh situation so absolutely\nNo way they don't show yeah yeah I actually called in to\nShield saw a we've got Charlie in Maryland hey Charlie\n... thanks for taking my call buck I just got a question you dealt with the FBI and their investigation of this a bomb threats\nAnd it turns out to be a ... a lefty political move\nIt's possible what's more likely right now well it's tough to say it's certainly possible as well\nThat this is somebody who thinks that they will and by the way they may be successful in this this person has been found by election day\nAnd if we find out after\nThe election that it was in fact somebody who is a a a left wing sympathizer who realize that the mob narrative was really hurting the conservatives I'm Sorry hurting or the left and did this was a whole shift in the national conversation on politics right before the election\nThey may be successful in\nInterfering if you will and the election with this whole\nA horrific plot and if we do know that until after the election that's just going to be the way it is so it's a lot of threads coming together here and we have very little information work offer right now will stay on it\nOr like I said Jones will talk to us next hour about the devices what he sees with them the photos of them I Know I saw one there was a looked like an ISIS flag on one of the devices and\nUm but but again the lack of\nThe lack of sophistication and the targeting and the lack of sophistication and the devices\nIs noteworthy to me is nowhere to me and um\nI'll just I'll

can find the careful because we don't know yet that was in and get the by you know did they sound like\nThis hasn't gotten a bite yet\nBut it's but it's Trump's fault is I'm I'm not saying that there's\nNot a correlation here between or clear lake between all these different yeah these are these are powerful Democrats who have been targeted but that they've been targeted doesn't tell us why they were targeted as in the motivation the motivation of the perpetrator\nAnd connected to the president is just\nIt's just disingenuous\nOh it just it was a really doesn't have any evidence there's ... there's nothing to try this together that they think the Trump is mean to them sometimes well do they get to the German when drop is not being mean to them\nDo they get to determine when Trump has finally been acceptable and his expression of criticism of the media what are the best and most powerful things that Trump has done is to challenge the media and to call them out for their bias

people are generally speaking so ... so welcoming actually of outsiders and that often gets lost in this discussion\nThat's why to remember that we we have\nWe are are bringing a million people a year into the American family either us citizens or as green card holders\nEvery year a million people every single year ten years have passed we have ten million new either permanent residents were citizens in this country who are formerly citizens of another country where at least permanent residents of another country\nWe're bringing people all the time and huge numbers through our legal immigration system\nAnd yet we are told that if we don't take\nThis group of refugees were that group of refugees are this group of illegals or that group of illegal that were terrible people and we're a century the equivalent of white nationalist and those if you are listening or not white and who agree with me on all these issues you're not a white nationalist according to the left you're just a I guess the nationalist but\nNonetheless a which is you know they also think is a very very very bad thing I saw a CNN trying to make some trying to make some hay of that you know oh it's a nationalist and trying to not think it was actually Jeff Cuban who who said\nIt doesn't really mean it doesn't mean Nazi as him to try to get on and you know one of the anchors at at CNN or one of the correspondence whatever's like oh no we know we know would match with SARS terrible terrible what he said\nOh of course it is um they they want to get away from the story of the caravan um because\nThe left realizes that this is a loser for them going into the election and there are there are constantly dealing with the following tension\nOr the tension that comes from\nNot being able to tell them this is true the Democrats in general they are not able to tell the American people what they really think and what they really believe\nAnd maintain their electoral prospects in the ... they're the ones who always have to play this game on things like immigration which is why that Obama soundbite where he said you know you can't you can't sneak into this country it's not allowed or we're not going to let people just surge into into this place\nSome people as a I think it was ... the New York times wrote oh I thought Obama was you know we're so are you know so pro illegals it's like yeah he's lying when he says that he wants to secure the border she can't she can't figure it out apparently\nA but but you see this time and again we're the left is just being dishonest about what they really want and I'm no ... this was new\nYou have ah\nMSNBC where the guy blaming the Reagan Administration for they play quid tend please\nSay that they also need to call out the fair Margaret ... during the one other thing I Would add to the Democrats should it ought\nTo say is that people playing some of these countries are playing some of these countries because of conditions created by Republican foreign policy particularly in the Reagan Administration when you have a problem with the images we can go back over time and see why these countries on the condition that they are right\nThat's right folks\nIt's American foreign policies fault that Honduras is a a hell of a whole of crime and corruption and violence it's America's fault you see every country anywhere in the world that's in bad shape is somehow are full that's the view of the left\nAnd it also informs their immigration policy don't think that that's just a throw away\nBecause the progressive in this country believe that America has only becomes so rich and powerful on the backs of the third world and essentially the non white regions of the globe\nThat is a widespread left wing belief you see it in in uh in academia you see it in media uh this is not unusual at all\nAnd in fact some of the Obama administration approach to foreign policy was also informed by this idea that America is why there was all the ... and the apology toward America has a lot to apologize for\nAnd they just functions in Central America are somehow according to leftists\nThe fault of America and therefore we shouldn't be saying hold on a second ... you know we we can't force the American taxpayers to subsidize all the dysfunction all the problems in Central America that's not fair they say oh no no no you owe that to them see\nThis is a fascinating and very destructive world view of the left has but it informs the Democratic party's foreign policy\nAnd the basics of it are that anything that we have to do when it comes to immigration when the weather's taking in refugees are taking it illegals that is going to be exact cost upon the American taxpayer is completely justified\nBecause we O's that you see it's our fault that these countries\nAre more prosperous are so corrupt um it's it's always our fault and less view and really what it is a globalized victim allergy\nRight that that other countries there are people are victims of the United states and therefore the Democrats need to be in charge in this country to make amends for all that victimization I Know it's\nLike we're sitting and and having

attacks on all political figures from shootings to attempted bombing\nOur part but civil war tactic did is becoming more and more pervasive these are attacks on the republic and the intelligence linked to the resistance is usually get sympathy the truth is\nDemocrats are not unique snowflakes they too will suffer the consequences of the civil war that they wanted to perpetuate and

the Unabomber case is using the mail or other services to deliver deadly weapons has long been this this uh it's\nBeen a frightening history and reality here in the United states anytime things happen like that it's a wake up call\nTo wake up call\nSo tonight I I decided that I think it'd be wise to turn some time over to a a good friend and informative the program we we uh we've had him\nA on before John ... he's a veteran law enforcement officer over twenty five years\nJohn worked for the U.S Secret Service San Diego police department us mend police the U.S customs service in his capacity within the secret service in Nineteen Seventy four the Nineteen Seventy seven he's there for over three years John was directly involved in protection of the president's first family the White House the vice president and his family ambassadors embassies in has a stake\nThrough the experiences is well documented whistle blower within the U.S customs service regarding corruption management abuses John has been interviewed numerous times on television radio shows talk shows many newspapers nationwide a a a Phillies regarding these vitally important issue since Nineteen Ninety five John Carmen welcome to ground zero\n[noise] good to be back blood or are you doing today\nI'm doing great I just uh you know I run into a a a a ... I guess you could call it a quandary as kind of a confusion here because you know when you jump on a story this soon especially something like this that appears to be\nA dare I say at an inside job but it inside job from the standpoint of who the players within the intelligence community is responsible for this\nYou know people tend to want to play politics again with this and it's not it's it's an attack on the republic we've had\nRepublican a leadership being attacked with rice and we've had a congressman attempted assassination attempts we've got all these things going on and people are saying well since nobody died it's really not a civil war but no this is this is a civil war would you agree\nThat those type of response as you're getting her from\nFrom the left for educators they're just trying to throw a monkey wrench into your relation you are the four runner and you are the best of the information I've ever talked to and I'm telling you you're hitting\nSo on line with this stuff that's all they're left to do is to try and you know the hurt people to tell other responses this stuff has been going on for years I mean I I keep thinking is that was quoted in some other national magazines of a sudden usual this\nSchool year ring a bell yeah a friend of mine area where this goes back\nAnd there's another reporter Gary Webb dead I mean how many hours you kill I say ... you know said Richard Gary Webb that's another reporter John ... I mean a\nCopy editor anywhere all arrow yeah Danny capital narrow he he got killed I mean\nYou did it on the Olympics this takes me back to the nineties\nWhen I was working closely with Mike roofer LAPD who helped expose John Dory each of the CIA or the excesses of the ... vote the cocaine in infiltrated the black communities where the ... freeway Ross left Iraq for an\nArea where I got a picture of me and Maxine Waters edge on these two cars corruption dot com [laughter] she didn't do anything to help us out really related Feinstein\nI'm Sorry there's a big D right after each of those names right\nRight right well what did you see we're just seeing how you know ... we had to be rising attacks just a just a little while ago and there wasn't that much commotion with the rice in the tax and even at a suspect within you know what a day or whole yeah yeah the um\nThe miss using my words here the especially being a rice and beans and it's um [noise] the the and it wasn't\nActually the ... yeah the castor bean that's right so when they're shoving a tons of castor beans in the mail is like wow really I mean\nLet's say ... but this goes back years so if you picked apart all the stuff like you do and I do and I know rod those you sift through intelligence and information you guys are on top of this stuff and that that's good because that means that\nUh I don't have to explain too much but it's like with all my background and training I mean I was within two or three hundred yards of explosions at the Russian embassy or sixteenth street which is two to three blocks away from the White House of Venezuelan embassy ring a bell yeah yeah\nAnd also outside the White House a couple of times Seventy five Seventy six right around that time frame was four and then\nSo receptive say he is it safe to say that this has all the earmarks of a criminal element within the intelligence operations that allowed this to go down to that was somehow put together by a a number of aerobics I guess you'd call them rogue agents or I mean I hate to use the word deep say 'cause that's kind of you know he made\nA left wing left wing Democrat socialist or is this what you're saying is that we believe yeah that's what those guys are yeah\nOkay so you're ... so do you believe that that's what this was it was it was basically staged by what ... extreme left group\nYeah they're stressed out they don't have anywhere to throw a little arguments like back saying you know block this far that they'll let them do this create a crowd or you know why it riot citizen I've sort of it that's a that's a felony and that's inciting riots\nWhat do you think though that you know I Know Donald Trump has been also raising the rhetoric and I find it weird that with all the rhetoric has been raised elsewhere immediately they seize upon Donald Trump you know Donald Trump is contributing Hillary Clinton actually contributed to this is why when she said well if you want civility you gotta put Democrats in the Senate\nAnd then Donald Trump said well if Republicans don't mean to say that there will be violence so you have the president saying there'll be violence you have a you know who the one who wanted to be president saying that there would be violence is violence will continue until they get what we want\nNow we have bombs being sent to people I mean it's like why don't we give the equal opportunity to everybody that's in signing the violence and and actually encouraging it\nRight and they've had assassinations already already brought up set for it's a very familiar I was working on something that I'm not going to talk about\nUm there were some other cases where people were assassinated\nAnd um it's all tied in with the shooting at the ballpark sees type of thing so all these things are excited but when they talk about violence and things like that there is a philosophy from the left\nThat it's OK so this is a communist philosophy is okay lose

that's something to this country does it we have a debate and we have conversations we talk we have dialogue hopefully dialogue with his balanced and uh\nAnd and that's something I think we're lacking right now I mean we're writing off people because we disagree with them and that's nonsense\n\nIt Eighteen sixty one\nIt was only one time in our history and Eighteen sixty one where\nWe just trusted the system so much that we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil war I don't know if we decided to the civil war broke out because we didn't agree we had such a disagreement about how our

were a you know\nBorder divisions and things of that nature it was clear cut as to what a civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability\nIs increasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\nAnd I know it's difficult to see the civil war is happening because we always thought it would be an armed conflict that

been proposed during the Obama administration has proposed but none other than John McCain\nWho now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict

symptoms\nOf civil war have not been diagnosed by the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military had identified illustrated the point by point sign post as to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on contemporary standards not the standards\nOf the Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there are major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course planned and and and I actually executed by a those in the deep state against President Kennedy\n\nBut a new civil war in America look something like this according to military planners number one the country would be infringed and national polarization would no obvious meeting place for resolution\nNumber two there would be increasingly divisive press coverage you need information flows weaken institution notably a Congress and the judiciary\n\nNumber three there will be a sellout\nOr abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimate as they are and the illegitimate evasion of violence\nTo solve any and all disputes\nNow I Know that that's pretty damning to actually point all these out and of course we have been analyzing and speculating about dean state\nManipulations it's a ... we've been told is conspiracy analyst said this is a an invention\nOf Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government has not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shadow governors always been the dark command that leads from the shadows\nBut it needs to be clear here\nWhile we're looking under rocks for false flag proof while we're having these disputes\nAnd the symptoms of war here in the United states the effect is working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs it will moment where their persecution complex can be proven which makes it even more suspicious especially when\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins Republican from Maine\nReceived a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis and chief of naval operations John Richardson were sent rice and and more than a year ago\nThere was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressmen during a charity baseball practice and yet since no one died this doesn't indicate civil war does it no not at all just were attacking officials\nBut this isn't registering in the media today the only thing that's registries the persecution complex we see on the left because the left is all one sided in their pain\nBut continued attacks on political figures from shootings to attempted bombings are part of a civil war tactic is becoming more and more pervasive these are attacks or the Republicans and and the intelligence that are linked to these resistance are using it for sympathy they're using on the Democrats were simply be the truth is Democrats are not unique\nRepublicans are not unique in the American people are not unique we can and will if we're not already having a civil war in this country\nBe attacks are happening to a lot more people than just the Clintons in Obama's there're journalists that are being attacked we've had anthrax being sent the journalists we've had rice and being sent a journalist\n\nSo time to wake up\nSome Americans if it is Suze Orman since they're not affected directly by the evil in this country they walk around like outsiders just like in John Carpenter is a movie they live they have not put on the glasses to see the real world that has been glazed over by an early political narrative that does not wish to expose the demonic infected among us\n\nThe movie they live created by John Carpenter was actually released Thirty years ago this November\nThe films so remains chilling only appropriate as a metaphor for what is happening today of course John Carpenter is responsible\nFor the movie Halloween which is having a bit of a renaissance is is forty years sequels selling out to the theaters across the country the original Halloween introduced us to Michael Meyers who was eventually referred to as the shape kind of evil that cannot be killed\n\nJohn carpenter's films or horror metaphors exploit what trauma does to the soul\nWhen he also infuses his films with a strong anti authoritarian messaging concerns about how our society is unraveling and there's always some evil hidden in the shadows ready to pounds with every moment in\nThe film they live carpeted portrays the government working against its own citizens that appears to be some\nSilent elite infestation the echoes the films invasion of the body Snatchers you remember that them however in the body Snatchers movie there were some people that we're realizing that their loved ones were losing their humanity\nIn a film they live\nCarpenters shows that the majority of the populace are out of touch with reality and they have allowed technology to run amok have allowed the lead to choose their values they are unaware that the war has been waged against them and their way of life do you recall\nCarpenter also did the film escape from New York where the future of America is fascism\nSo the bottom line is\nThe message has been quite clear and no one seems to be listening we're being fed a series of\nCarefully contrived fictions but they're no resemblance to reality [noise]\nThe age of provocative tours greet these attacks in order for us to feel as though we are threatened by forces beyond our control [noise]\nAnd with these tactics they're able to destabilize the country making us distrustful of each other divided by our prejudices of the others throats these types of events generate a lot of fear based retaliation\nTheir symptoms if Tom part of or within the realms [noise]\nIn
