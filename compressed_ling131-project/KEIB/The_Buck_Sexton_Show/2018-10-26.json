{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "Or whatever procedure that this particular specialist is going to proceed with um\nYou know so no I I wouldn't go to the doctor or I Would get comfortable with that doctor one of the two\nUm nah maybe that that's an off putting enough 'cause it's kind of a weird request it may be that that's off putting enough to you that you just don't want to use this doctor better than what you said in the email\nSometimes I hear people say you know I I'm not going to tide that that church because I don't agree with things that are going on at that church\n\nBut you're going to trust them to spiritually train you you're going to trust them with your children's show one Sunday school class you're going to trust them to influence you on your view of scripture scripture and your walk with ... but you don't trust them with your money\nWell let's just dumb so into the system is appalling\nYou don't trust them enough to touch you don't trust them with money but you trust somebody you're so that's just weird\nIt's just a bad idea so that's the thing now I have at times with the church that I'm attending while I'm watching the misbehavior of leadership\nAnd I've taken a little time off of tithing and set it aside a little bit to see how this was going to turn out but long term if I'm not willing to give their I shouldn't go there\nIn the same would be true of this doctor story here and is with us in Baltimore, Maryland Hi Anna how are you\nI'm great how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise] I paid off thirty five well not paid off but I paid thirty five thousand dollars\nIn less than a year good for you huh toward thank you taught student loan fixing to you and then I was in a car crash and the money thing going for medical expenses and\nUm I Do things I locked my motivation and also and the other thing is\nI found a great deal I have come out of body um problems with my car and I found someone who is willing to do do it for cheaper price\nAnd I want to get the repair that but it's going to be eight hundred dollars\nAnd you don't have eight hundred dollars\nWell I have that I Know you're not gonna like that but I got it I have a thousand dollar emergency fund not the Ira gets hit ... and they ... they are going to get that\nMoney [noise] um I can save up\nI mean I thought you were out of that\nOh no no no I'm not out of that well just paid off their I've already five thousand and less than a year but now that was torn my student loan that actually I have\nAnd you didn't pay the IRS before you paid your student loan\nThat this came out of nowhere that I haven't I'm getting paid park in the mail from my CPA that half a fan too so that's a marked on right now\nMhm solid now mhm\nOkay and so you have one thousand dollar saved for emergencies is all\nYeah but I I have I got a credit card and I know you don't like credit card and I don't normally use credit cards but it's still an extra Twenty one line and I can use the credit card and just pay a hundred dollars a month\nUse it for what could come out of body repair which is eight hundred dollars yeah yeah yeah\nI ... and I mean that that's so\nBackward from everything you've ever heard me say I'm appalled that you think I Would actually respond positively to that ridiculous statement\nI mean really\nYou just called Dave Ramsey and said I Want to use a credit card on the air\nOkay well I take that back I won't [laughter]\nI mean either way you are going on here no I mean you've gotta you've gotta think about now Dave Ramsey things but you need to think about what how do you want to live your life here's why you lost your motive\n... says you're inconsistent you need to say in your mind and in your heart of hearts and you need to grasp intellectually and spiritually that the shortest path to\nWealth and generosity and stability and your finances sustainability is to get out of there and stay out of debt and at that point you're saying I'll never borrow again as part of that\nRegardless of what you need to have happen now you have a car accident that you're not getting insurance settlement for that\nNo they're saying that there was no no ... ... a damage to our vehicle and there than they don't believe that um that crash injured me but I I'm actually had pain before the crash occurred\nSo I'm just paying for myself with my um health insurance\nOkay but I'm Talking about the car wreck that so you did not get any insurance for\nThe damage to your car\nOh yes I did I got five hundred dollars I tell my students are\nOh okay\nInstead of putting it on the auto body repair which now you want to do yeah so this repair is very very minor an eight hundred dollar yeah just a bump it's not our okay\nSo the eight hundred dollar repair the reason I Want to do it now becomes a great deal because it's not it's damaged that I've been driving around with\nFor a long time and other damage yeah let me stop everybody that it was like a few thousand dollar let me stop you for a number one I'm not going to tell you to borrow money you knew that for you call me right\nNumber two and this is not an emergency\nSmaller margins ... it's a great day it's not an emergency\nI don't care if it's a great deal of emergency and you don't have any money you accept what's in your emergency fund now and you've got the IRS breathing down your neck which is a lot bigger deal than a bump on your car\nAnd so no you didn't clear up the Irish and you know you save up the money to fix the car if the guy won't do it in a year from now for eight hundred dollars then when you actually have the money then you just won't be able to do it with him you just missed that deal but so what\nI'm you know one thing I have learned is that when I Am impulsive\nBureaucratic nightmare of an investigation going on merely to target their political enemies that's the whole purpose of it\nThey now have mobs in the streets mobs on the Supreme Court steps mobs on Capitol Hill only in the halls of Congress\nThey pretend that they're not mobs and then\nWhen there was finally the first time that they think they have an opening to whack a finger at the other side over instability which remember it wouldn't be the instability of a mob it wouldn't be the instability of an entire movement it would just be maybe\nOne wacko who is sending what increasingly looks like yard bombs to very very prominent Democrats and leftists\nAnd they want to lecture all of us and they claim that they're not doing which just goes to show you how much gas\nLighting goes on in our conversations with the left I I Will give you examples of us we will spend a bit of our time this hour working through just how dishonest the left is being with all of\nThis just how delusional they really are\nBut I didn't want to spend a moment you first on what we what we now know about uh about these\nBombs in fact I could have been a shift here from the attorney general my buddy Jeff Sessions' place with a please\nJust ... apartment is responding\nTo the suspicious packages that have been sent to several political leaders and a media outlet in the last last few days\nYesterday I spoke with FBI Director Chris Wray and and deputy director they vow outage and\nWe met with and brief the president to bring him up to date FBI ATF are working on this for profit ministry ration weaken them the actions that led onto a these ... these activities and the strongest possible terms on terms into determined\nTo make sure that if we get to the bottom of an injustice was done\nThey will find who is responsible for this I'm very confident of that I don't know how quickly though and I don't know if it will be in time for us to make a fully informed decision us being the American people you and I already know this\nDoesn't if it doesn't affect my vote doesn't affect my feeling about Trump or the Republican Party or anything else that has nothing to do with safety threat\nThis is one very very stupid and ah and agree just an evil jerk I wanted to use another word but we're on radio\nOr who is going to spend the rest of his life in prison it's just a question of how soon we put him through that process\nBut the ... bombs that have been found so far no could they have gone off could they have detonated under any circumstances there was a press conference today with the NYPD in fact one of my uh some of my former colleagues were named in the press conference I had a bit of nostalgia\nBut they talked about how the bombs that haven't gone off it kept getting asked the question by the press are they real bombs or the ... the M y pd is going to have to say you have to treat these as real threats because just imagine for a moment\nThat the largest police department the country's as no these are these are judge and then the next just vicious package that goes out whether it's by the same person or not\nBut look similar person opens it up and goes well I Know what to do it and then we have a tragedy someone loses limbs site maybe docks from one of these pipe bombs or the NYPD can't take that risk not yet\nCan't say that these bombs wouldn't have gone off under any circumstances but I'm here to tell you that I\nThink that is increasingly likely to be the case and if that is in fact what's going on here\nLet's just take a step back I Know I'm not supposed to say I know I'm not supposed to go\nThere but then again I actually professionally did this on like Ninety percent of the clowns going on MSNBC and CNN to talk about it and in the past when they've tried to tell me if those places what is and it's not real when it comes to terrorism or they have tended to get bucks slapped rather hard\nHere's what I see if you were trying to come up with a means to change the entire national conversation\nAway from Kavanaugh which was toxic for Democrats in red states and Democrats in states where Democrats were struggling the Kavanaugh debacle self inflicted wound was toxic\nAnd the caravan making its way up through Mexico the far left activists when the Democratic party loves this story um but the people and places like Indiana and Tennessee and Nevada who are figuring out who to vote for gas what they don't much like the idea that the Democrat Party\nIs effectively an open borders party\nPrivileges certain people from certain places\nOf the world getting around the rest of the immigration system because\nIt benefits the Democrats electoral prospects they don't like that and so if you wanted to switch that narrative if that was the purpose it has been master fully achieved here\nNow is in fact possible\nSome would even say probable I'm I'm not quite there yet I Need I Need more evidence is it possible problem this is one incredibly stupid reckless and\nA ... and really her doing whatever side he thinks he's on doing tremendous damage to it is it possible that this is somebody who wears a mock a hat and and loves Trump's so much they thought that the way to\nThe way to show support was to violate hundreds of federal statutes threaten people terrified people and in the process put himself in a sure fire\nA position to be spending the rest of his life in federal prison is that possible absolutely that's possible I'm not discounting that at all we may find out that that is the case\nHowever am I willing to discount am I willing to push aside that if this was in fact somebody whose purpose was to change the conversation right before the midterm I don't think anybody believes this is a coincidence in terms of the time and\nIf the purpose was to was to push aside conversations that were damaging to the Democrats and in the process\nMake the anti Trump media seem sympathetic and give them something to talk about that might sway some moderate to their side just in time the election would this be a successful strategy yes I Am talking about a false flag strategy\nSaying that this is from Trump's faults\nAre despite the fact that the president has already come out and condemn this whole thing like with a\nKnown location can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political and Jim ... co workers your or control we all know that there is one\nWay or the ... largest agreements gold peacefully at the ballot box the media also has a responsibility to a civil to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks in stores\nNow I I think that the president should be completely allowed to say that but that I think you know some of the statements that he's made have set the meaty off even more\nBecause they they think they're in charge and they have the power to just construct a narrative here they think that they're allowed to just say the president is the reason this is happening and everyone has to say you know what you're right\nThe media has spoken that's the way it's going to be they they like the John Brennan version of events\nPlay six unfortunately I think Donald Trump too often has helped to incite of some of these feelings of\nAnger not by less um when he points to acts of violence or also talks about [noise] you know a swinging at somebody or from the press the media of hoping that this is going to make it clear to him about what he has done as your before as far as a lot of this rhetoric\nReally is counterproductive it is on American\n... is on American says the guy who was a senior intelligence officer who without any evidence\nHas accused publicly accused the sitting president of the United states of treason which as we know is not just the crime that is a pro scribes view of the constitution itself but is punishable under us federal code by the death penalty or so one would think\nThat John Brennan is not exactly the best person to be carrying the torch of civility now but then again\nOne would be mistaken if one thought that the last ten any decency or any honesty to deal with your Felipe ranges making a name for himself being the craziest of all play clip seven\nThis is someone who has a weaponized Trump's Twitter feed and made it into a hit list what we've seen to date as someone who whips up the crowd he is addicted to their response and their response they are addicted to his\nUm betrayal and while he might think that he's just putting on the TV all you need is one person\nWho doesn't realize that and one person who thinks it's okay to do this someone tried to murder for Iraq and Michelle Obama bill and Hillary Clinton and this is not a coincidence\nSo now Trump is responsible for any single individual psychopath in the country that takes his words to mean something there not also did believe brings forget that just a few weeks ago Donald Trump junior [noise] had a white powder since he was home and his wife open didn't had to go to the hospital\nIs is that just not as important to the left as judge bombs being sent to people I I guess the answer is yes we'll get into this more stay with\nThe best education I have the best language I have the best answers I Know the difference between him and the media is they despise the News I'm\nKathleen Maloney none of the tens suspicious packages recovered this week exploded\nWhich could help investigators find the sender government official is drawing attention to what appears to be thick black electricians tape and the pipe bomb center former CIA director John Brennan\nThe official said investigators are hopeful that black tape capturing DNA fibers or print Fox's Catherine heritage homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen warning that thousands of migrants marching through Mexico will not be permitted to cross the U.S border\nWe're not had any intention right now to shed people they will be apprehended however uh but I also take my office or an agent uh uh their own personal safety extraordinarily seriously they have the ability of course to defend themselves\nNielsen in an exclusive interview on Fox is the story with more than a cow I'm this is Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bug sex is back [noise]\nMorning America is different than less extensive plot to kill US government official and prominent American history took place it targeted to former presidents their family cabinet official members of Congress\nAnd the free press the objective apparently to help out a little spokespeople for the view of the Democratic party [noise]\nIt was an attack on reporters and on democracy itself [noise] people will say you can't blame the president for something that twisted person would do that is true that president ... grind up the shards of glass intended to name and kill\nThat he did come out [noise]\nUndermined American values and ... those who dared to question his conduct\nKidding about that type of favorites hysteria based on race and religion and political party and it has the potential to me what happened yesterday and we don't even know how far\nAre obvious question is does the president bears some responsibility obviously not for the the bomb making or or the or the recipients of but does he barely responsibility for the tone that allowed it sure\nSure he does and that's part of the reason why I never endorse them and I've never been personally critical of him\nBut yeah it does bear responsibility for the divisions are he has the biggest megaphones\nTrump they say is not responsible for the bombs but he is responsible for the moms that's the formulation that you get here from the anti Trump bluff that's really what they're saying oh\nI'm In I'm not going to tell you that the reason this happened is Trump I'm just saying that Trump is one of the reasons this happened this is why people despise the press the press deserves to be despised ... full of a bunch of self important cry babies and liars obviously not all people\nI'm In the press technically but a whole vast majority fall into that category\nAnd they have completely jumped the shark\nHere or there not waiting to find out who's responsible for this they're not even putting this on conservative ideology or on the right in general they're going right to the president dishes yet again another attack\nOn the president folks dishes trumped arrangements syndrome that we are seeing\nThe president that teachers are sponsoring this guy sending bombs to all these people walk through so I just need to understand the president's not allowed to criticize bronco Obama's presidency not allowed to make fun of Hillary Clinton\nNot allowed to say anything nasty about Eric Holder and it is that now the new standard\nIf President Trump were inciting violence meaning you should be violent against people\nOr you are violent acts you should do then he would be guilty of inciting violence I Know this is the problem it leads you have to talk to them like the first graders shorter some of the first graders listening 'cause you're smarter than lives but that's what you have to do you have to walk them through this\nNone other than a Mr fake tapper himself over\nToday tweeted out that in response to Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that the first thing the media did was blamed Trump he said that's not the first thing we evacuated CNN which is true in terrible and should not have had to be evacuated because nobody should have ever threaten them and that's an awful thing but then he went on to say no one blames Trump not one person\nAnd the CNN [noise] uh no that's not true\nAnd I know what's happened would you 'cause he likes this game he'd say no one blame Trump for the bombs oh okay that's right no one thinks that Trump was in the west wing putting together these bombs with his bare hands or whatever okay we're in the east wing no one thinks that what's happening but they're all saying including the president of the CNN network\nThat the environment around all of this\nIs from ... creation Trump's fault any environment led to the bombing so in essence from does have responsibility for that is what they're saying\nAnd that's exactly what Mika Brzezinski did because I think her audience that's the end at the MSNBC\nDemands it you know the intellectual honesty be damned they simply do not care it does not matter to them that what they are doing is indefensible that it is wrong on so many levels to talk about divisions in this country as though they're a bad thing\nAnd then two in the next breath maybe even in the next sentence maybe even in the same sentence\nSay that those are the that the president that states is responsible for those divisions is just to create an even bigger problem isn't it\nWe'll be right back [noise]\n\n\nThe FBI calls home titles F. one of the fastest growing crimes my friend's brace yourself if you've ever had your credit card stone it's nothing compared to the hell you're in for what a feat steals your homes title everything's online these days including your home settled domestic and international thieves\n... American homeowners because we have equity in our homes and the bad guys are stealing it may take you off your homes title an add an alias then they borrow hundreds of thousands using your homes equity and stick you with the payments you won't know until you get a late payment notice\nIdentity theft programs and insurance policies don't protect you\nHome title lock safeguards your homes title from ... and a half years by putting an online perimeter around your homes title\nThe instant they detect someone tampering with it they're on it to shut it down for pennies a day home town of ... protects my most valuable asset my family's home you needed to register for a free now says you have your homes title has been compromise that's a hundred dollar value free visit home titled rock dot com\nI think that the time and money and your business than to be attracted that talent what was your office that attracted him pulling today's workforce once in office acted mobile enacted they are they're standing desk solution help you create an active when they were employees\nHappier healthier and more productive dairy products requiring little to no assemblies for free incumbents at thirty days risk free guaranteed all married that product at various dot com slash radio that can be a A R I gather dot com slash radio\nHow does one never miss a customer again when customers called check your email expressed to me automatically engages them with your digital content simple tax flyers coupons menus priceless video audio or anything else expressed to me it's much like sex codes but with voice and email too\nAnd more content options without a high cost or complexity learn more today at expressed to me dot com expressed to me never missed a customer again that expressed to me dot com\nMostly not tempered ... refer to one of my family county's only\nSeven seven seven votes out or to find nothing hours and ... and his ... his whole life having a website for Apple's like time\nDuring early voting from ... to make ... voted harmful\nFor the president is going to continue to point out contrast the policy between Democrats and Republicans people absolutely have a choice to make\nA on what they believe in and it couldn't be clearer and we're going to see that happen and the next couple of weeks when the elections take place and the president's going to continue to lay out that case but at the same time we're condemning violence and calling on all Americans to come together\nThere's a difference between comments made an accent take and the president is certainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages to someone no more than a Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up or Republican baseball feel\nThat should be a pretty pretty clear line right\nThe standard here Asian some big shock it's not some huge surprise it's not something that we need to take a step back from and say hold on a second ... how do we how do we do this how do we deal with this right you are not responsible for what someone else does because of your politics\nYou may be responsible for violence if you're directly incite violence and that's why even with our First Amendment there are some exceptions for incitement to violence right if you're in front of a big crowd used a burned down that store across the street and then they burned down that store you are morally called the Boeing and legally\nLiable for that Matt\n... you know but but if you say I think we should have lower taxes in this country and then someone hears that and they run down and they light the IRS building on fire you are not responsible for that okay because if that were the case thinking about how that could be abused think about the way this would expand the hecklers veto\nThink about how that would shut down discussion and debate\nAnytime somebody wanted to just credited political believe friday allergy all they have to do is have one person yes that's right and false like fashion\nAct like a complete idiot\nAll they have to do and then everyone says oh she see that and it's just common by the way you see this with this is a a continuation of a debate you have with radical Islam\nThe left will always rush to say the radical Islam is not in any way representative of Islam and then any jihad or jihad is aren't representative of the broader Islamic faith that they will say that\nAnd then when you were responsible hold on a second ... who are you to who are you to to declare what is and there's not Islamic member Obama set of the un future does not belong to those whose land or the prophet of Islam one of the strangest things us presidents ever said and that kind of form\nA but they'll fight ... Jews are now on that one meanwhile if some guy you know somewhere who's white named Billy Bob\nUh says something mean to somebody and and says something racist or whatever to someone\nAnd commits a hate crime that one incident is magnified it did it by the media is oh my gosh there's look at all the hate in this country look at how hateful we are there's three hundred and twenty million of us one idiot somewhere did something bad but he's white and male and on the right so that means that the right has to own this whole thing\nBecause because one guy said something racist because one racist incident when is it the exception when is it the norm this is a very important perception game that the media engages in all the time\nAnd this is where we can't we can't give any ground we do not have any political culture that embraces mob tactics intimidation and violence similar to what the left as we just simply do not\nDoesn't matter that there's one incident this one individual has done this this has been roundly condemned ... with a ... there's not a single conservative of any standing anywhere in the country\nWho was that anything other than this is disgusting this person should spend the rest of his life in prison or work with persons probably one guy but we'll see\nBut on the left\nYou'll hear well there's no there's no such thing as mobs really there's no problem with getting up in people's faces and yelling at them there's no reason to demand civility when you're dealing with a political party that his show on uncivil in its ideas according to\nPeople like Hillary Clinton [noise] the left his radical off [noise] we are the ones who are holding the torch of American values and freedom and western civilization in this country they're the ones who are kicking the load bearing walls of all of that\nDo not forget that for one moment in this debate that we're currently having in this country\nDo not left left get away with its lives [laughter] I was visiting with\nBuck about his show on home title fraud where the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nAnd it's simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy and home title walk found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had it been real this is the foot of taking out loans using books home was equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments ... showed up in that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud look if you own a home or rentals or have elderly parents get home title lock for pennies a day\nHome title luck puts a virtual barrier around your host title the instant they detect sinister activity their own at helping to shut it down their arms titled may already be compromise you don't know sign up and get a free title scared and report\nAs a hundred dollar value free at whole title luck dot com home title walk dot com [noise]\nClosing in on clue design\nMy friend Sean Davis over at the federal us as the following quote Grassley criminal referral of ... and sweat Nick also contains new evidence that sweating it has a history of making false rape charges\nUnder penalty of perjury an ex boyfriend says she explicitly threatened to falsely accused him of rape\nAnd have him deported\nGrassley has criminally referred ... and sweat next to the deal jade FBI for three specific felonies conspiracy to defraud the United states oh barring the over abroad but\nGot to show both sides live under it um favorite tool of\nMuller materially false statements to federal officials and deliberate obstruction of a federal investigation\nWow\nOh yes this needs to happen I think ...\n... is a serious and very powerful guy in the Senate and this referral is going to be tough to ignore the department of justice is going to have to look into this and that means folks\nThat there could be unlike the proceeding that the left was so excited to use to try and smear Kavanaugh which was not a standard criminal proceedings right there they could not subpoena people they could\nNot a take their phone records it by the way they're no phone records to take the allegations were from thirty five years ago or whatever it was just the whole thing was insane and I'm so I'm going to say that I Am so proud\nOf what we did hear on the show me and bike and John the whole team and all of you supporting me when that was a really difficult a couple of weeks especially in the early days we knew it was garbage and we ... we kept their shields Hi yes we did\nWe held the line on this one and people notice by the way\nThere was a front line on defending capital and we hear in the freedom that we were on that front lawn publicly in every possible way I was in contact with the White House team I was trying to get him through the confirmation on a near daily basis\nSo um\nThat Grassley is not passing this thing up and saying okay you know we'll let bygones be bygones is the right move\nAnd this could did this will mean that the deal Jay now has the ability to pull records you know they they might be able to see some communications perhaps between sweating egg and other people but you know this ...\nYou want to play in this game you want to try to lie and get somebody ruined and smear them you're gonna sign ridiculous sworn statements with no ... nobody would be able to tell you yes or no I mean the whole thing\nIf they can prove she lied if they can prove ... he was part of a conspiracy for her July they must both be criminally prosecuted the law either matters or it doesn't there's really not a lot of room for interpretation here\nIf they can prove it now there is the possibility that they won't be able to prove that sweating collide because her charges were so vague or the statement that she swore was so vague I was at a party in the eighties and there were gang rapes and I think maybe Kavanaugh was near the punch maybe he wasn't\nBut then again she changed her testimony publicly from what the sworn statement was which is when we all knew that this was not just a fix but an obvious fix that was when it was clear to anyone paying attention\nOkay this really is too much this person has a problem this person is ill is sick so um and that's where I think we are now\nBut if they they're they're going to try to do two things on the left now because by the way they really don't what can you imagine if Julie sweating it faces criminal prosecution for what happened there what then we're supposed to think what the other two women just they were the ones that were really attack but Julie sweating it just came out of nowhere to lie thinking about what that does to the narrative\nAnd I am very clear on this one for if you can prove somebody makes a false criminal allegation against anyone they must suffer the consequences because they are doing violence to the truth and they were trying to ruin someone's life is an attempted ruin nation of the human beings life that must be punished\nCrystal Gail magnum I told you this this was the uh the stripper who claimed with Mike knife on that despicable district attorney down in Durham North Carolina that\nDuke lacrosse team rape curves complete fabrication a total lie which you find the guy was raping or who was miles away at an ATM machine and they had him on video and using his card there so kind of hard for him to raping her when he's a few miles away\nA complete fabrication they didn't press charges against her they did just far knife along and he should have gone to prison for a long time but the justice part him\nShe went on to kill her boyfriend stabbed to death later on maybe she should have actually had to deal with justice supports you should have had to deal with justice perhaps somebody would be alive today\nNot only did Kavanaugh survive and therefore due process survive with him through this process\nBut if we really do care about truth and decency and justice in our system if we care about due process and the right to protect your reputation the right to face the acute the to face your accuser the right not to be destroyed\nAt the political whims of the left for their convenience than people who lie in order to destroy you under oath must be punished\nThe left is going to kick and scream over this one because it's a very bad look for them they know now will they be able to prove this I Can't say quite yet\nIs it clear to me that sweating it as a liar absolutely absolutely I as I Know she's a liar not just based on statements he made a base in the contradictions overstatement if you don't say I think someone spiked punch at a party which what what would that even mean\nThat was such a crazy thing to say in the first place he spiking what he's drinking the punch how would you spiking the punch\nHe's gonna he's got a poison we're very or get super drunk all of his male friends too so that they pass out and can't move\nThink about that she didn't she didn't say spiking of drinks spiking an entire punishable that everyone drinks yeah maybe he was putting alcohol in it so that everybody could have some alcohol but he was the whole thing it's just it's none of it rang true it was a fabrication out of this woman's mind she's deranged she's a range I mean\nAnd that's where they're going to say if if they really nail her on the lie the story will be\nShe's not sound mind let's let this go she suffered a novel that kind of stuff I'm Sorry I Know if she was a sound mind enough to bring these charges and try to put the final nail in Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation coughing cheese of sound mind enough to have to face the consequences ever actress to have to actually stand up and defend what it was that she was saying and how she was saying it and she ... she sworn affidavit\nThat either has meaning or does it so I Hope Grassley pushes

link or I can get a country that's part of Canada in any kind of in our country and well they returned home\n\nOkay that's true but but but but\nThey're being coached along the way they are being told exactly what to say all they have to do was establish a record and that just means saying they don't think that's a ...\n\nIt's it's sort of switched around it used to be that Central American immigrants at the border would would ah would lie and say they were Mexican because if they were going to be detained and sent back they didn't want to get flown back to Central America because they spend a lot of time and money often do you get to the border\nAnd so they would rather just be released back into Mexico you their Central America but now that's changed because of this asylum claim situation and as long as as long as they can\nI'm\nConvinced a border patrol agent or a few border patrol agents and the uh immigrations and Customs Enforcement\nProcess that they are from Honduras um they're going to be part of this asylum deal right they're going to get brought in and letting the injured United States and as I've been telling you that's not going to that's just there's never going to be real enforcement alright what can be done about this I'm not going to have a bucket or whatever\nThe issue the ultimately the thirty thousand foot level Congress needs to change the law so that it is very clear that asylum ... they need to change the asylum process so that you apply in your you know in your country or in the nearest country you can get two\nAt a U.S embassy and there's a process it it should not be that you just present yourself in this way out of port of entry\nUm because you're in walking within walking distance the United states that's not that's not the way that this law should be but uh\nAs important that is something called a safe third party said third country agreement is well I like to tell you things on the show that you won't hear from other people because I actually read lots of things and do lots of research because if you were kind enough to spend your time with me I have a mandate to make sure that it's time well spent team\nSo the say third a third country agreement would mean and we have one with Canada by the way so this is not some ... crazy concoction and we've we've discussed\nThe possibility of this uh at the government to government level with Mexico\nBut what it would mean is that we would set up\nAt the border but on the Mexican side of the border and were you yes we would probably have to pay for this and I was a book they should they should pay for it will go a lot faster and much more effective if we pay for it we would set up a centrally trailers you know a a holding facility sounds like it's not attention facility but it's\nA what would be somewhat similar to a a refugee camp situation it would be a place where people you know they have uh they're they're able to stay safe there's water there's food um but it's on the Mexican side of the border\nAnd we would move infrastructure down to the border so that you have\nAt port of entry courts\nSo you would start you would move the judicial infrastructure to deal with these immigration cases right down to the border\nAnd people that were waiting for their education process so that would speed it up obviously and people that are waiting for their education process would be on the Mexican side of the U.S border\nWhich means that they don't uh they're they're not able to just go further and further endanger United States and get some you know immigrant rights lawyer to represent them pro bono to keep suing the federal government all the rest of it if their claim is denied guess what\nThey they get to stay in Mexico or or the Mexican government then can can hand them off to their country of origin\nI put that way you prevent what's happening right now which is using the legal system and it's very important we understand as they are not illegal immigrants\nThey may cross illegally\nSo then they are in the U.S illegal at the moment that they say I have a credible fear of my safety these Honduran immigrants\nGo into the asylum process and then they're due process allows them to stay in the United states that is the law I've talked to senior immigrations of officials about this is talk of lawyers about this that's how this works\nSo we need to take action here beyond just we're going to enforce the law the border that's great that's a good start but if you have this caravan of seven thousand that gets all the way even if it's only a thousand that gets to the border\nAttacks are that at all fat anyway how they are and if you think the caravan to as I can I like that may not incredibly ... special Paolo ... to get to the border I'm at you know on the day of the election again that's that's not right in fact I think to have to understand I Am very much and ... year old\nSo\nOkay I mean a bruise your Mike right I Want to bring you as an as an impartial observers\nHere that you know you can tell it's a little there's a little bit back and forth but there's nothing to do crazy there right now that was good at the conversation this is exactly the guy's a spirit of conversation and then things get a little a little more tests like Ninety\nThere was another tweet that said the Democratic party is comprised of racists white liberal that is correct\nAnd I write the flight well let's go back on and let's say I will say that that many people in the ... are not aware of what's called ... that I Am concerned about the color and the White House um why why would you ask a question\nThat has to think about like I said well why why we get to a class at that flight after after that last or fact because they get an idea about that\nBecause you're bringing a whole crowd that young African American leader so I felt that this article I talk about that in fact last light levels don't realize that you put on that\nThat way for them it at a caution that they are I Am also a little ... God had placed on how they're going to crash it that way I look I football had I've had a special that way for power that will shape fall\nAnd I find that Russia for ... I don't agree with that if I don't want to acquire a column I ... I I travel a private static Chinatown Congress ... out of Iraq\n[noise]\nYeah I felt like I got a little I got to look at their word yelling it was civil but I felt like a little bit tension there producer Mike yeah definitely it was fun I like watching it and I like looking at the [laughter] the this is\nThe problem whatever whatever we have a segment like this\nAnd I'm like well that's not really the ... the show every like puck shut up people are funny [laughter] I'm like well wait I thought I thought we were the truck tree I thought this was the mist either do it I think we're all gonna supposed to like you know\nBlock slap each other and I'm not even ... there there was born there and I'm like okay 'cause the control room because I kept going beyond replay their their control rooms like we got to go to break we got to get a break and I'm like okay I got a great because it was like no not done I was like damn okay here we go\nSo uh yeah it was a spicy spicy one day when they will get we'll get producer Michael one of these panels man that oh man my could we do that absolutely right yeah\nThe bosses would lead on that already that that'll never be the same again buck I Know exactly what Mike slot Mike slaps will be like new truck bomb it like on the left living I'm real quiet on assuming tell them that yeah no no you do your your feisty and I know the Irish are I'm I'm like half hour a guy I'm One one thousand Native American but I'm half I'm\nGood thanks thanks where I see I Want to make sure that we got producer Mike in with\nThe with the objective opinion there because you know for me it's like I mean I obviously ideologically agree with Candice I'm and I I think that she's very talented and but I also am very ah very fond of Cristo even though I think that her politics or\nOr I'm\nWrong [laughter] so you know we were just it was it was quite an exchange there and\nUm we'll see tomorrow I'll give you a little preview later on in the show with the expectation is for a for tomorrow there might be I might be involved in a a shall we say more more spirited discussion tomorrow things I might be the one that actually has to do a bit of a\nBit of debate but we've got a\nI don't we don't really have time to get to the ... ... is the funding to say the men that guys\nThat guy's been treated ...\nSays well you know we we can actually do a little bit of it so I interviewed Papadopoulos we're this one today and here's what he said about the notion of Russia collusion play twenty\nWhat is what are your feelings now that is as it has come out it's been a reporter here at the hill that there was an exculpatory evidence based on your conversation with an FBI informant that you weren't trying to you\nThe wrong that you oppose any trees in our collusion that that information may not have been presented to the Pfizer court what do you think about that [noise]\nUh of course it was for me it's a it's a very sad that it was I was impressed when John ... reporting but for me it was a sad day to see that uh that was not presented to the price of the court\nAnd then my entire image has been characterized by this false narrative that I Am some sort of patient zero uh about a Russian conspiracy and a a Russian a Coca Cola collusion conspiracy when in fact I have absolutely no Russian contacts whatsoever\nI've never traveled to Russia I don't speak Russian I don't even have Russian American friends are in this country so um when I found myself at the epicenter of this a conspiracy\nAs somebody who actually has no rush of contacts something just to not smell right at all to me\nGeorge Papadopoulos who remember when\nWhen it looked shaky on Carter Page you also had nothing to do with collusion or conspiracy running this stuff\nBut it looks shake it in the auto Papadopoulos that's how the FBI justify this investigation that that it was supposed to be Papadopoulos I'm telling you people who believe that Papadopoulos was\nPart of some of some Kremlin backed conspiracy will\nBelieve anything don't believe anything\nSo she's making LeBron James money to do a job that a lot of other people could do quite honestly better than her for about a tenth of money\nI in fact there were other people doing the job before that we're getting better ratings and we're making a fraction of her salary people on them but executives at these places are big public companies places you know NBC and NBC Universal and they're owned by the big paramount or big a parent a paramount parent companies and\nUh you know they could they can determine what the salary is right that's 'cause we've got shareholders public companies lots of ways to slash the money around without any Bruce or Mike oh no no no I don't want my kids say sixty nine mill none of them like I Know that's for now that's severance I'm In a year and salary\nThat's for her full they're paying out her full contract that's what that's sixty nine mill is I'm I'm Talking about you know\nThe uh\nThe year to year so we should make a lot of money but it's like a ... she really worth that the answer was no um you know they some of these people will get in touch with the corporate structure at these places and they get huge huge paychecks but anyway so then Megan Megan a had a few\nBumps here and there I forget exactly what they were but she oh she brought up a Jane Fonda is plastic surgery\nWhich I didn't realize Jane Fonda would be so sensitive about but she was and it was kind of a weird thing to bring up in the interview under the circumstances and that was kind of a bomb for a you know for her to bring up in that way just wasn't wasn't smart\nAnd anyway the latest controversy which has gotten her ousted got booted from NBC\nWhich you remember she gets booted right away for this folks you know\nSpecial sex dungeon door closed by button under the desk Matt Lauer guy was there for decades and\nWas the the the chosen one I mean the the face of that network twenty million dollars plus a year I think it was actually making more like Fifteen but maybe twenty five million a year they're paying Lauer unbelievable sum of money\nFor a skinny balding we'd who was completely replaceable by about a hundred different people but Andy lack in these people that NBC make decisions they liked Matt Lauer is that's all you have to do that like you you're good you know\nIt's not about the ratings it's not about the audience really what the what the execs think in the\nIn the east sweet or the C suite the corporate suites we should be the way it's called so Megan\nDecided and our segment on Halloween and political correctness decided to tackle the subject well that was the subject and and here's what she let's start with what she said that got her in trouble John Cleese play said clipped\n[laughter] you'll get in trouble if you are white per se but time or a black person white they like that that was okay as long as you're addressing character trait\nAnd there are places in New York with ... as she got the Diana Ross and she made her scandalous darker than it really is and people said that that was racist\nAnd could come up with an around her one day I I don't know how like that that rate how\n\nSo she didn't say anything racist what she said was that\nShe doesn't think that people necessarily dressing in costume when they dark and their skin to be in costume should be considered racist now you could agree or disagree with her\nI Would note that a lot of you probably liked the movie Tropic Thunder I think it's a very funny movie I think the best part of the movie is\nUh what's his name Morton Downey junior right the guy who plays Iran is not as name William ... what's his name again you got to leave me out here to dry well what is the name John\nYeah Robert de Robert and I'm more Robert Downey Jr and Robert Downey do more than ... yeah Robert Downey junior show\nSo he uh you know he ... he was in black face in that show I mean and that's a movie he was he was driven by protecting a black man in blackface and they make fun of it during the movie and it works and everything's pretty much it's a funny\nMovie you know there was no picketing there are no people freaking out about it at least not really and a movie did pretty well actually\nSo there are situations in which culturally black face has not been deemed to be a insulting and racist I I just named one now I also can understand why given the history of slavery and segregation in this country in the way people use to dress in black face in in in ... [noise] excuse me in mockery\nAh that that would be offensive to some people I get that I'm I'm not\nBut I'm just saying that she is not even really taking a definitive declared his position on all the she's just trying to have the conversation\nBut because she veered away from black face under any circumstances is racist is wrong is terrible really any darkening of the skin is part of a costume is racist and wrong and terrible NBC\nJust I mean they had different anchors coming after NBC just fed her to the wolves\nOn this one and then that led to this which I always find so depressing and and the whole thing is always so sad the Soviet style show trial forced apology\nI'm here is what she said in an effort obviously to keep her job one that was doomed to fail before she went on the air please play her apology\n[laughter] how I make and Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry [noise] who made her they answered a we had a discussion here about political correctness Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a percentage of one race to dress up as another [noise]\nBlack person making their face later or a white person making errors darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it as that was respectful and part of the Halloween costume fooled okay well I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great parts of sitting in his chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view and as I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface being used an awful way by race it in this country it is not okay for that to be part of an old costume Halloween or otherwise\n\nNow I could have told her mega called me up and I have a soft spot\nFor her because she used to be nice you know started my career and having on her show and used to tell me that I was very talented and had a huge future\nObviously enhancing the likelihood of there being ugly incidents\nWith all the stuff that we are going on so I I just I refuse to play along the way that they want and say yeah you know what all sides have a problem here how Trump even to this is something I Want to I Want to leave you with on this and then we got to talk about Hillary in a moment here get ready for it it's coming\nHow could Trump even comply with what they're saying here let's say Trump came out and said I won't use enemy of the people anymore for the media I won't say that any more\nDo you think that then they'd say oh okay that's reasonable\nYeah you know Trump's toning down the rhetoric I guess he's not such a bad guy after all I Know I I guess I guess we gotta let it\nEven though they wouldn't do that you know that's not what would happen that's not what they say they would say oh that's not even start to this oh he's so terrible they just want to hate him they don't really want him to change his behavior even if he did changes behavior wouldn't really matter to them\nWouldn't matter so I'm just note that by the way you know one one little sudden I'll throw in there I've never cooked bone and pork chop before and this weekend I'm hoping to actually give it a try went to a butcher especially Bush or and got a couple of big thick bone in Port jobs I\nWant to make a little spice rub Fordham mounted them overnight tried to student my cast iron I miss talking to you all about my corner adventures it's been a while and I haven't had the time to cook recently so this is the I'm going to try to bring this back because one of those things that when it's done right I just think some credible is they cheered\nA shared bone and pork chop is something special as you can tell I\nHaven't eaten yet and I'm doing this radio show and I am quite hungry so that's what got me my mind my mind shifted a pork chop land because I'm starving and it's been a long day [noise] um but we do have to talk about Hillary coming up here and then roll call and then maybe I'll get this year and myself a pork chop so\nMuch more important stuff coming up so they wouldn't be doing [noise]\n\nNews I'm Carmen Robert federal investigators believe there may be more package bombs out there so postal workers are on alert and searching\nFor terms attracting we have a ... over six hundred thousand plus employees out there right now so we have their eyes and ears looking for these packages\n... with the U.S postal inspection service three more packages found Thursday one to actor Robert Deniro into two former vice president Joe Biden none of the ten

plant only affects doctor administered dry [noise]\n\nLately it seems like everything we use every day is getting an upgrade on the bed we sleep in the race we use when we wake up but we've neglected one of the more impulsive products and not just [noise]\nShe's holding the line for America bucks back then is that [noise]\nWhat can I Do that will uh brighten up your day a little bit it's been a tough week for America right no question about it the market's been getting battered obviously we've got these ah bombs getting sent all over the country people are being nasty to each other there's moms everywhere and all that stuff right\nWhat can I Do that will just bring it all home and make us remember you know what\nIt's all going to be okay\nUm well what if I told you that Chelsea Clinton's thinking about running for political office\nI see what I did there that's right I got you ready for one thing and then I pulled out another part\nShe is thinking about it which means she's gonna do it\nShe's going to do it folks she was talking to the journal news at a stop on the tour for her new children's book starting now you can make a difference just\nJust try to you know she she really needs more cash you looked at ten million dollar apartment in New York or mom's worth a hundred million her husband is a hedge fund guy but you know what what whatever kind of cash grabs you can go and that's right having children's books ghost written for\nOh man oh man it's amazing\nShe Chelsea said quote I think if someone were to step down or retire and I thought I could do a good job and it match my talents I'd have to think if it's the right choice for me\nShe added she doesn't have any plans to run for office but it's something I think about as I Hope every young person thinks about first of all no\nI Do not want put put aside Chelsea Clinton for a second hand why put aside or Chelsea and just know that not every person not every person should be thinking about running for office at all okay there's there's a really very limited number of people that have the kind of a thick skin temperament\nSelf aggrandizing attitude and yes that feel called to serve but increasingly I think politicians are mostly megalomaniac um there there is an increasingly small number of people I think that really should do this and\nI think that everybody should\nLove is where I Want to talk about term limits I mean this is just this notion that we have the political class that we do and they just stay in power forever is because the system is set up to the people that determine what the system is stay in power but maybe the conversation about terminals will have to wait for another time\nI just think that the Chelsea Clinton to the notion that somebody would want to vote for this person who's never had a real job\nAre and who was sort of let's not forget according to even some leaked emails was thought a very poorly at the uh you know the foundation the bill and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton foundation where\nShe was supposed to be a a boss and a figurehead at the same time she was not well regarded there are people thought that she acted kind of like the ... boss's daughter which is what she was\nAnd I you know this is one problem are going to have on the right now and I want to get too deep into this but\nWe one thing that we have given up is for for quite a while we're not going to be able to complain about nepotism we're just not not with any not without being as hypocritical as the left is so I and I'm not saying that this is the end of the world I'm not saying it's a huge deal\nBut just to understand that when they try to put forward Chelsea Clinton and they will\nThere's cause the Clinton it's it's the Clinton named the Clinton brand is still so well known and by so many Democrats despite what they'll say about Hillary behind closed doors are they still think of the Clintons as a Kennedy ask dynasty they really do\nAnd Chelsea doesn't have any of the baggage of bill or Hillary baggage on a baggage or just you know like to say ladies uh doesn't have any of that so they're going to trot her out\nAnd people like me will say she has no record of any accomplishment she's a brat she's never had a real job and and likes to go and give lectures what is your getting people lectures on what is she going to give speeches on\nHaving jobs that she's been given because of who are parents are no the the the struggle is real being a\nA political celebrity and incredibly you know what I mean it'd be three incredibly wealthy people throw thirty thousand dollars at you for a speech when you're not even go to public speaking that's what she has I'm not trying to be mean I'm trying to just give a real assessment of the situation\nAh and I'm telling you she's going to run so if you think that we've had the end of talking about Hillary Clinton and the Clinton dynasty and I know I said that this was going to this was meant to cheer you up and I I guess you could say had fake EEO because\nObviously this is a go to accept some of you I'm not really but it's it's a little annoying but we'll be fine though it'll give us something else to make fun of and we can always played it\nAre just grabbed it then I squeeze the trigger I never told him to the story\nSo you said it was an accident you said you just grab the gum and you
