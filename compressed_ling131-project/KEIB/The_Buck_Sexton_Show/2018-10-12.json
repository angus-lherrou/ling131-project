{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "And are you trying to put money in every category and the budget\nThey think they'll be leaving car grocery do back here about twenty five dollars an hour and that's how he scraped up a hundred dollars or twenty five dollars a week not okay alright Raman noodles rice and beans\nGotcha so what's your household income\nUm between thirty and forty thousand dollars a year my husband was an actual guard and said what did you get to go to our duty as an extra thousand dollars a month [noise] but when he's home he works for my parents Showtime and he makes about thirty out here\nWhat does he do for a living [noise] me about your mhm okay\nSo what's he want to be doing ten years or Twenty years from now that makes them a lot more money\n[noise] um because you all are starving to death [laughter] I ... I talked to him about it and he's like oh I don't really like dreams that would be nice to have more money [laughter] he acted hears\nI'm always worked really hard we got married when he was Eighteen and he worked about sixty hours a week then on the corner and held that Haiti is a hard worker and he'd do anything for me\nMhm okay um\nI wasn't questioning hearty works I was questioning and making money\nYou see the difference yes I work real hard to you do yeah a lot like\nThis week already sixty hours and It's Wednesday so I'm a Thursday or whatever it is I remember got what that is are we go so anyway but I'm\nA I don't always do that every week but you know you've got to look at things and say for the labor I'm putting out on the time I have away from my family and the stress and the strain on my body in my mind and my emotions what am I getting paid in Europe the answer is not much\nAnd that's part of what you are facing as your income challenge\nIs that right okay and I'm so why why does that bring tears\nI feel like we've just been we've had to go on\nAnd you know like I Try to be we try to be financially responsible you know we we've never been ...\nYeah I don't think ... I don't think you're irresponsible I think I'm wrong I really I think you're doing really good 'cause you don't have the money\nI feel like at this point I had hoped to be a little bit more had paycheck to paycheck yeah\nYeah but it there's two parts of the equation right the income side and the other side and you know have you noticed I didn't even ask you about the I'll go out and you're ... yeah and that's because I think you're probably doing pretty good there\nReally aren't we should have baby step number you're down in about six months\nI think you're right I I think you're stretching the few dollars that you have really well so I think you're I think you're very responsible people I don't think you're overspending I don't think you're crazy I don't think you're spoiled brats um and I think he's a hard worker\nMuch yeah\nWell I think you've got all that stuff going for you and that's why I Want you to win better than your winning and so I really think you guys put the kids to bed and I turn off TV light a candle or two and just sit on back porch and talk and say\nWell we only makes them more money um and it's not 'cause money's everything it's because when you are or you know doing the best you can do with the dollars you have and they're not stretch and then we've got to look at something what are we going to do to create some additional income ... short term and long term\nWell that's what we did last night and I actually got a job at a local library but after I pay for childcare only bring home about thirty to forty dollars a day [noise]\n[noise] so that's that's not that's not the answer then right after we got a better a better income coming in to afford childcare if you're going to be working [noise] yeah and he's got to have a game plan and I don't know whether he opens his own butcher shop or whether he becomes the most famous but you're in\nWorld doing it on TV I don't care what he does [laughter] I'm not saying you could not be a budget but uh you can't be a butcher of their ten years from now and be anywhere but where you are right now is it makes sense\nYeah and so I I you know what are we going to do with the skill or this thing or did he just fall into this cause your parents were doing it or\nYou know that's kind of exactly what happened\nNow and so but I mean what if let's just kind of take the white board out and start over eraser life on the white border second and say gosh if we can do anything we wanted to do what would we do\nYeah and then let's go about doing that they went to ... today\nAnd walk in and throw you know throw your knife down and walk out that's not what I'm saying but I Am saying we need a plan that takes us somewhere\nWhere we say okay this month I got a hundred bucks left over but it's not always going to be this way what it is always going to be that way if you don't change something agreed\nAgreed okay I think you ask them do it you're good people this is not a lot of character issue and it's not a a lack of a effort issue and it's not an immaturity thing you guys just simply mathematically it's income on is outgoing or not much income\nYeah it's all in all it is\nWhat how do we go about things like that but my parents then you know like it would really be\nWhen he's gone to drill here they always talk about how inconvenient for that and it's so hard on my dad got heart problem and we have to take over all of the work at the very very small operation\nOkay so let's kind of think about this for so [laughter] this is not working for your dad\n'cause it's not working for has not working for you yeah so this whole thing and it working but I don't know how may not the way of bringing it up is we love your own we'd love to help you but we are starving to death over here yeah and we're not going to continue to do this anymore\nAnd you don't have to do it today but you you know you can say you know my husband we don't we're taking classes and\nHe's going to be a an X or y or Z two years from now and that's what he's going to start doing because that's really his\nDream because here's the thing\nWas somebody is going to make some decisions to shut some stuff down or you're going to be sitting exactly where you see it\nOkay and I you know but ... you know you cannot be in this thing of oh we have to starve to death because that's the only way my parents have a good life without a doubt that's not that's not logical\nThat doesn't make sense right yeah you're right and the truth is your dad if he's got a heart problem and your husband is not there he probably needs to sell this or close right yeah and and so when you start thinking about that or does it make enough to support you guys if your dad was out of the picture\nDoes he need to go home [noise] [noise] well\nThere we go it's not like we divide but not a quake we're not\nLike we're not at all part of the owners of it\nI Know but the owner or cannot operate it without this particular employees what you're saying yeah oh well I guess I Need a new employee or then you talk about selling it to you\nOr giving it to you or something I don't know y'all can talk about there's a lot of different ways out of this mess but continue into the same thing is not a way out of the ...\nAnd um so ... so I'm trying to change the day in and out to change her the turkey and nobody has to be mad as throwaway round or say anything unkind\nBut we just have to lay say you know five years from now remember doing some different ten years from now it'll be something to do something different and we are going to make more money there's almost all of them get on that's where all these fears are coming from stress and that one out of your dad's good people too and I think they will actually

I think the algorithms that you have a lot of hate hate speech in your and your Web sites we won't posed them\nOnce again the robot determines whether or not you're a racist based on their criteria you know we're constantly getting these hints\nAbout more civil war and license for violence and the motives of course getting what you want the motive\nYou know we want so many people to go out and vote but we don't want certain people to win and if they win will keep being on civil to one another if they if they lose maybe there'll be more violence\n\nAnd of course the media says about Trump when he said about the ... violence to Georgia wow that's respected you know he's a he's a fear mongering narcissistic blah blah blah blah blah blah you do that anyway but then Hillary Clinton says\nConsequences be damned we need to have instability until we get what we want\nAnd claim of civility could return when Democrats have power is this measure the ends justify the means\n\nMeanwhile she said this when we got Republicans are being shot stabbed docks be mailed\nA a rice in powder run out of restaurants sent death threats and yet she says\nWe got to be on civil until we get what we want well who's giving the chilling responses right now\nSome guy I guess a bit of two hundred pound bombs you want to detonate on election day one guy said he was going to do is loaded was reported the news Eric Holder's basically set out by the quote somewhere Eric Holder the streets we said we need to kick boxing about the Republicans we need to kick them when they're low\n\nThese are words and warm\nAnd I know people don't want to you know want to they want to admit to it but they are so what do we do well you've got to be fighting a civil war which reviews they're going to do it why don't we take the task these people are making these statements including President Trump\n\nYou know we we stopped blaming the Russians for our meddling now we're doing it wide open\n... or there's meddling going on the media's meddling Hillary Clinton is battling now Donald Trump says well the that's meddling too\nThat's voter manipulation in my opinion is more than ...\nRegardless of what you think of your president regard what do you think of Hillary Clinton back his voter but it'd be only should\n\nSomeone who just sit down with him and say you know you just did what you about your ... your manipulating the vote Hillary when you said that the Christian on the ... vote\nI'm sure they don't care\nI'm sure many of you don't care that I'm telling you this because you're thinking well there's record delivery my card the concerns are are neither I basically telling you what is\n\nIt is what it is\n\nTo go to Sarah in Oregon Hi Syria Iran ground zero to feel they saw the heat [laughter] than the main street\n[laughter] okay there's one thing you haven't touched on now [noise] I'm going to preface this by saying that\nRed as it stands nothing Hillary Clinton said actually suggested violets\nAre really really ...\nThe opposite of civil is not violent it is rude now I Know that they're being very push ally and dangerously rude but they are being rude nonetheless not violent not yet ... does not have a party and if a black law I don't think anybody realized that they don't have a party\nThey don't even have a left right there a black bloc okay that I didn't call to talk about any phone what has been done\nBy Hillary in the service of whoever's\nPutting out to black lots and all the other thing is a lot more insidious than simply saying we cannot be violent anymore we have to be violent now that's not what she said remember that most you you prove this the other night\nWhen you did your show that most Americans have no idea what the word civil war means it does not mean a civil war\nNo not necessarily all\nMeans no not necessarily not at all civil means states Sable civil means within the state or city or something else it it means it means within state instead of with other states\nThat is what civil war means and that'd be a new civility nothing however\nHillary said the exact opposite of go do a the violence that the civil what she did no one is realizing is they use of the worst\nCivil suggesting exactly the opposite of what she is saying\nShe's calling on all the people who don't understand what civil war means and using that word as I said it's a dog whistle\nIt's so subtle that you didn't pick up on it wow she all she had it was dropped that word because it confuses too many people and that way she's not saying anything that she's nine citing any violence she's just saying I'm don't be nice but\nShe's using that word\nBecause we don't understand it and it has a lot of connotations that we don't even understand\nBut in that case then she's going to have a backfire on her when you agree\nWhat do you mean\nWell I mean if you do if it was a dog whistle and you've seen or how you know people have acted towards a conservatives you seem you know like Ted Cruz being harassed I'm not in ... you know\nI'm I'm not sure she knows what she did I'm not sure she goes to cheat I think somebody encouraged her to say that\nWell but it is obviously you got the New York post printing out newspapers said are you going to just declared civil war\nThat's right that Hillary doesn't doesn't control the post no the post controls Hillary than me controls Hillary and media controls Trump because the media is controlled by those who wants to civil war and the media doesn't know it\n... doesn't know it to be strapped doesn't know it to the deeds they basically are you using the media diminished doing civil war and they're using both Trump and Hillary\nAs pawns in in in the whole matrix that's the mini me no I yeah I did this begin to hate the word hate or deep state but yes what you're saying well say he's real I mean come on what you want to call it man I don't know ... when when one of the other term for you to\nBe very beats a dark stayed a Machiavellian or does really a darkness or I don't know what I Want to call it [laughter] you bet you really got talking about the big long time ago when my little\nBy this or is such a well\nWell well that was really good point really it really was [noise] it it's just as scary as what I said probably a little bit more intelligent but it's very [noise] Oh yes\nBecause it it goes deeper than Trump Hillary this goes deeper than Democrat Republican this goes so deep we don't know where it's originating\nIt goes back to when I said the other night about all the factions want war it's not about right or left [laughter]\nWhen you play your top of the I have I have to turn your radio down or up because I ate here and they get up\nAt the point when they know language in that area or put it in there we don't want you to give up we want you to listen I Do think you wrote it well thank you\nHave a good night yeah that's the story but the opening theme it's all about giving up when the loudspeaker says ground zero they want you to give up we've already had our ground zero we had\nBack in two thousand one will be the theme was made long before nine
