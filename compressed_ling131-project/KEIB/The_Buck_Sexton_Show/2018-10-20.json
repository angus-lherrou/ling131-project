worth Fifteen thousand dollars less than what I had bought it for five years ago right now I'm so therefore the units of the same style inland as mine and I know the lowest\nPrice at like a thousand dollars good\nUh yesterday a similarly and it came on the market five thousand less than me so one hundred Ninety five thousand I'm starting to feel a bit of arrogant feed us out because it's sitting empty and winter is coming you know I was thinking of dropping my price to one Ninety four and adding an incentive\nOh for pay my way of kind of got out there for ... pay five dollars out of pocket on the market is [noise] but my question is how would you how much we shoot ... out of pocket to get rid of that thing how long would you go\nHobbies you'd have to obviously you'd have to have the money to pay out of pocket that'd be one of the limiting factor and I really don't I don't know what I'm going to judge the situation and\nHow quickly are these things dropping\nOverall and you know that's going to give me my urgency um I don't I don't want to just get emotional about it I'm going to judge the future and say these things are going down in value there's already five oh I'm On the market\nI've got to be the lowest one on the market um this is not looking good you know so um I Would I drop it another fifty thousand no I wouldn't you know so you know so at some point you do you

liver scaled down here on the Patriot am eleven fifty and we are just fifty six minutes away from tip off you are a staple center it's game two of the regular season and the clippers are taking on the Oklahoma City thunder\nAnd right now let's bring on Brian's seeming to be achieved there so you have to explain what happened at the end of the last game where the clippers were so good closing out games last year where they had the best off into rating in the fourth quarter they were up by eight was five minutes left what went wrong for this team against Denver\nSo I'm going to ask the doc rivers I'm gonna run down after we get done talking and this'll be my one of my first question is to him and to me or one of my first statements more like it to me it looked like a group of players that hadn't played together in a moment like that\nAnd on top of that a group of players that hadn't played basketball in a long time I I get pre season and they get training camp but\nI mentioned this throughout the game that you know when that red light goes on when the games matter you know there was a different energy there is a different vibe and often times you can start thinking more or you can start thinking um that I Need to take this part over I Need to do this and we saw that down the stretch I thought with a couple of key players in a couple of key players so\nIt was jumping doc expressed concern about throughout the pre season and even before the game can this team\nExecute they've got big shot makers and takers with Lou and gallon are adding to biases certainly are capable guy\nI Would positively not not a rule out she just Alexander a down the stretch as well\nBut to me it was a lot of rushed in those moments where the team that is not familiar with one another that's what I chalk it up to that's not going to go away in one game okay they're still going to have to fight those quote unquote demons for a few weeks I think\nPost game I talked about ball ball and Mariano junk clippers talking maybe they kept him out there a little bit too long but the other side of that is he was their best offense all night long when they made both the ... and the second quarter and fourth quarter\nIt was both bond leading them but ... percent post game maybe we did go with him a little bit too long you talk about the team being out of sync late in the game is that just continuity and chemistry or where some of those rotations just needing to be worked out by ... river still\nProbably a little bit of both and ah you know even rent mentioned after the game that she deserved to be out there at the end of that ball game and he will be out there are at a ballgame he wanted to go with defense in two veteran guys to help them get through the finish line I get it up but the team just looked to me very stuck\nUm which tells me they're thinking and they're uncomfortable whereas Denver and while they're not the spurs of the nineties they've been together for three years I mentioned this on the show the other night as well doc in practice last week said look Denver doesn't have to show up again for a practice and they're coming out execute us on that first game\nUm you know the interesting part let's not forget\nA it was ... there's a lot of negatives in that fourth quarter in those final five minutes and I get it but clippers were down a Lebanon came back took an eight point lead a and they just couldn't finish it off I took some positives away but certainly a game where you thought you know you don't think you should have probably had that game they should have won that game for sure\nOne of the positives was Bo bond he at Eighteen points in Eighteen minutes okay it wasn't quite as good as as a teen in Fifteen minutes that he had against Deborah last year\nBut he's been ridiculous those are easy numbers to double for your ... thirty six by the way which is you talked about the herculean type effort he's had during the pre season where he's putting up wilt Chamberlain like numbers it translates in game one so how much are we going to see both on tonight and throughout the rest of the season\nI still think it depends I think he's going to get a crack every night or does he play Eighteen to twenty minutes every night I don't know there'll be teams that will be able to take him out\nSeeing Southern California like Fifteen not a

a professional you went over eight in game one that's very uncharacteristic for him in fact I looked over box scores for his entire career\nAnd I had not seen us that line that bad I saw some over six someone parades and two for twelve one pretend but never oh for eight\nSo I think the law of averages are going to come into play tonight and Patrick Beverly is going to have a much better shooting game aside from what he offers this team on the defensive end where he's very good\nBut he has been shooting about forty percent from three the last couple years we expect more of that as the seasons

they'll be was tapped by the Cleveland Cavaliers with a number one overall pick in that Thirteen draft\nAnd Thirteen was not a lucky number\nThat I played for four teams that his first four seasons averaging less than five points a game he has though pocket and some sixteen million dollars in salary along the way\nStill I'm happy to say the twenty five year old for it has not lost your search for the game\nHe will be a part at Bryan Adams aguaje called the addict slippers in Ontario this year it is except for his G. league team there'll be happy to keep a close eye on it as much as former number one overall pick seldom or available in the minor league\nThat she was also Thirteen draft already has a major impact on this match up tonight the clippers and okay see\nThe thunder mind the players in that ... to an extraordinary level it was a strange draft to be sure maybe the two best players from the class were chosen out of the lottery that Greek free ticket number Fifteen by Milwaukee and big Rudy go bare number twenty seven by Utah\nLook at OK okay seat they use affect your all the ... the number to pick an address to acquire bold George last year\nAnd they support

future today a couple of years ago several owners the bomber was the lighting and telling me about the future of sports television as he saw it\nWell the future is now and bombers flippers are leading

is it the clippers are the first game to offer this to the fans owner bomber is leading the way again\nWe get more of a national perspective coming into the season on how the clippers were viewed they want forty two games last year they had all the injuries they have I Would say more talent right now but the team and the cemetery and the chemistry haven't exactly connected yet\nYeah I mean I think they are kind of in that like pain in the category of teams to play like nope I\nDon't think anybody's going to want to see the clippers on their schedule because they know\nThey're going to get tested defensively I think I'm obviously the defense in game one I think wasn't what they wanted to be it'll be better but um I I think that's the biggest thing is you die talked about a free game having guys that can get in you at three quarter court it just makes it not a fun night you know and they're going to win a lot of games\nAgainst teams that are either ask counted are saying more town to because they're going to play harder and they're going to do more on defense and I and I think that's sort of you know the\nPeople were really high on their young guard\nOr something people talked about a lot I think ... is a guy that [noise] you know because of the summer league people ever really high expectations for um somebody's Harris is a guy that people have expectations for but I think as a team I mean people view them as a team that's like right on the edge of the play offs just like they were last year a team that I think is going to be their\nLast couple of weeks of the season fronting first by because all those teams are kind\nOf the same you know I mean we saw in one like\nIf I told you today like Denver so much better than the clippers I I think that's you know probably lie I think that's just not true I mean I think Denver has maybe a little more star power at the top like a guy like yo kitchen cupboard stone and maybe have a guy quite like that\nBut as far as ... and stuff like that I think they're they're really interesting so the\nThing I I Wonder about it give me your thoughts on this you know we we look at the NBA or let's say over the last Twenty years yeah there have been many teams that are stacked like the clippers in this way you know not a big star power seeing\nBut very deep Detroit get it you know or one of the title with it got to the conference final many times within the next team that I remember\nIt would be Denver back in two thousand and Thirteen with the new law gallon are going down a week before the playoffs I don't remember the team\nThat comes up by the way people talk about a little bit like the the post mellow no\nIt wasn't yeah seven ... and you know and again if if their best player at that time which was Gallo doesn't go down people wonder what could have happened to that particular writer so I'm curious to see what happens here and and the thing that makes me even more curious\nWhat a poll by can deliver good numbers Eighteen and eight and Fifteen sixty minutes I don't see it as realistic but yeah twelve addict and ten twelve minutes and you got shape who is going to be a consistent rookie it looks like\nI mean does the ceiling get heightened in and you see another comparable to him over the past several years like you to the clippers you know start the top right now you know I mean I Would say maybe\nLike the playoff team Utah Jazz now like free\nDonovan mental Utah Jazz teams I okay what Carlos booze or and and like more like when go bare would still be learning how to play when\nThat was a team that was making the playoffs kind of based on sort of their their them being or the whole being greater than the individual and then obviously you add that image a lab mix and that's even gets a lot better [noise] uh I you know I think you make a really good point about the seem like the thing with both on it and I got the sense of watching the team in the pre season a little bit the doc was\nYou know I don't want he's always been a permanent monster right like this has always been something you look at is basketball reference that like the permanent members or through the roof but\nFor whatever reason you can't you can't keep them on the court um because whether or not you know it was lateral speed is ... throwing picking roles you can stretch them out or or whatever it is um\nIt seemed like in a prison that the clippers were trying to find ways to make this work and I do think they kind of above on friendly roster and stuff that you can play him with poor guys they can move around the perimeter that can switch that can do all sorts of stuff defensively that maybe you know certainly that Detroit couldn't do and that maybe this bird or or doing you know forever ago\nOne other point that I think I'm equipment one thing that I'm interested in what they have to say I'm sitting here right now we're looking after the rosters already for I Know this is a a not a visual media but I have a list of ... players sitting right in front\nI think this was a team that's also filters down a little bit [noise]\nA team that can make a traitor to there'll be competitive\nThat they have so many players they have a lot of flexibility and they have so many they can help so many teams you you look around the teams that have holes around the league teams that need depths of front well for good or is that three cents\nYou know teams that that needs you know defensive wings recovers have [noise] you know a litany of the um the guys who can score they've got you know so they have like these different pieces um you know they might not\nHave that frontline guy I think obviously the plan is to get that guy here in the you know next year um but you know right now I think that's a future that they can maybe pick up an asset or to along the way I'm while still being seen not going into a tank or anything like that but still you know selling and and and\nGetting back a drastic or two I think that's something that's very very much in place that was the\nOne guy who is currently on the roster that could turn into a star possibly\nIn this week I think it's ... you just twenty six years of age coming off his back then [noise] he's a modern\nPlayer with the way he plays all offensively he doesn't hurt you he takes three she makes threes where do you see him progressing as maybe a borderline all star possibly later on in this\nWell I think when it comes on the players like survivors I mean I think you know often to the games there right so it's like how can you help you on defense um if you know he's got kind of a physical profile to be somebody who could defend these are\nAthletes wrong [noise] um [noise] you know I mean you remind me a little bit at least ... uh [noise] you know there's I feel a little Carmelo in him and maybe it's the headband maybe it's my had been ... as\nLong as there's less jab status and I don't know yeah\nBut I mean but I mean he's the guy gets around and shoot music I've been\nSmaller defenders I remember talking to players like grant hill used to say that that Arab Carmelo Anthony was the hardest got a garden the NBA and this is\nThe Ronald leaks now is because nobody was that strong in that field and I see that\nThere I I think to me the next step for him obviously as\nYou want to consistently being that twenty four point range and now you need to be making an impact on the defensive and to and if you're doing that [noise] yeah like an all star game certainly employ if you're winning you know I I I think you've got a chance I mean you ... contract do um I think the team as as a really interesting decision to make them as\nAs they try to move forward and see part of their equation um I think he has a I I think he certainly has the skills that to be a top require on a good team I don't I don't think there's any question about that\nThe only question that I have and I agree with you and I've taught the players I've talked to coach is about to buy a piece of dream to coach is low maintenance he is a positive teammates and if he is your third best player\nI mean maybe better these Golden State and you're still in the mix but those guys now you're competing with those guys if Tobias is your third best player you you have a really really\nLike your your now we're talking like you were in the Boston ranger in the Houston redirect Ron arrange\nLike I mean like that you're in that top zero of teams in the end\nI think he will you know and that's certainly talking about a few minutes still doesn't have you know we still don't know exactly what shape is going to be I mean I'm looking at Emory now going to one was my first time in person this year I saw him on some early and it's just like you look at how long years and and and like he has so many attributes that you want out of a guy\nWho loved Betty like finished around the basket that I think that's a really matures kill 'em that he's kind of an unorthodox finisher and\nUm there's a lot to say about this man I Do feel like this is a team that's going to be better than people think that is going to be um ... on a nightly basis I'm not allowed city Eric liberty is not that kind of team\nBut it's a team that I think is going to be kind of allies whoever they what ...\nYears Dan ... from

clippers I mentioned it earlier both teams committed oh and one last year Oklahoma City one forty eight times I don't know if that's a success or not at the regular season certainly in the post season it was not they were bouncing the first round of the Utah Jazz I bring that up because\nWhat they had the quote unquote big three talking with doc rivers last year throughout the season\nHe felt like at any point in time that three could catch fire and just be a terror to deal with problems in the playoffs well they ran into a bunch of what the name of the Utah Jazz isn't mentioned earlier it didn't go well many people thought that Paul George was going to leave he did not back down to four year extension who did leave\nCarmelo Anthony the interesting part about Carmelo leaving was he did not want to accept the venture off there are I mean there are tips they're all over the place about Carmelo being asked about coming off\nThe bench not backing mediate anyway she is well the interesting part of it is and we'll talk more about it on Sunday he coming off the bench out for the Houston Rockets the only real edition or in the\nSun under Russian you're using Dennis shooter a very good players but the first few years of his career with the Atlanta hot sauce with doctors there's this morning about that hand between he and also watched what he said it's going to help them both mentally so it'll be interesting to see we will not see\nRussell Westbrook here to the idea of knee surgery just before camp began\nThere was a four to six weeks process it does sound like he could be available as early as Sunday meanwhile for your Los Angeles clippers well it's a tough road to start or the clippers this year I mentioned this a couple of us I'm back on Wednesday\nThirteen of the first fourteen games are clippers playing Oregon plus five hundred teams from a year ago\nTwenty of their first priority Oregon playoff team from a year ago only the Brooklyn\nThat have that same number to start in their first thirty game so\nAnd I tweeted this out the other night\nPatients will be a virtue here do not jump to conclusions with this team I firmly believe that if everybody is helping regardless of where they may or may not be in the middle of December [noise]\nThe team that I think to make a big run into the playoffs I don't know what their peak will be in the terms of wins I just know they're going to be a tough team to deal with\nMeanwhile the clippers to in seven\nAgainst the Oklahoma City thunder since March of two thousand\nAnd sixteen and after tonight they'll play stick to the next nine on the road they do play Sunday here in downtown Los Angeles against the Houston Rockets they turn right around\nMonday they'll take a flight to the French Quarter to start a two game road trip come back for wanting to go back on the road for three and kind of an odd dig dug across the eastern part of our wonderful country I mentioned how there is no was Russell Westbrook here tonight how about this number [noise]\nThis is the first time also has ever miss the game against the clippers and his entire career you\nGo back to his rookie seated in two thousand and eight he has played thirty six times against the clippers\nClippers are sixteen and once again those games there was an even series up until the last couple of years as I've mentioned there just to in seven in the last nine games against the Oklahoma City for what it is worth I Know you're asking\nWestbrook catch or triple doubles and those thirty six games including the last two times out against the clippers take a look at the starting five for the clippers in the back of course\nThey defensive minded back court is going to the court in that category as you will see I'm curious to see if there is a little bit more of a smoother transition here tonight it'll be Patrick Beverly and\nA brief Bradley neither had their best shot offensive night that they will have the Beverly was oh break from the field but I did not think so he was a liability on the floor at any point in time maybe Bradley had some nice plays and again defensively\nMade a nice impact marching Gore top will be

whenever I played [noise] uh basketball or going back to like a high school that you're not going to believe this I only played when the game was decided already\nI I give a lot of credit was a lot of game balls to be passed around but obviously the one that sticks out the most is the one at the end and that's the bias Harris\nHe started out for for five he didn't miss ten consecutive shots only to follow that with six consecutive makes you end up with another double double twenty six and ten a but I felt I mentioned is going into the break you know Lou really set the tone in the bowl bond helps finish it off I mean\nThis is how I think the clippers are going to win games I mean it's going to be everybody contributing somebody like Tobias or Lou ... by the way only had twenty six points himself on sixteen shooting\nWhat have you done for his lately he did that in the first half we forgot all about it but at ten points in the third quarter I mean he was a great he really was and he felt great about his game you could tell he was very active taught finishes twelve rebounds and\nUnder the clippers out rebound Oklahoma City no they get out rebounding fifty two to forty seven but some way somehow find a way to get it done\nThis was a scrappy win and you know we're used to you know the big three from a couple of years ago when they would when they win big and they wind you know a sexy style of basketball there'll be games like that for the clippers but there'll be few and far between I think it's going to be a scrappy lockdown type of game\nUh for the clippers this year when they win and it will not be unlike what we saw here tonight\nAnd I feel like and this happened last year being and close games like this makes you more battle tested\nAnd that clippers team last year was very good in the last five minutes of games within five points we'll see if this clippers team is to we've had a you know a tale of two different games going on between what happened on Wednesday night and tonight\nIt was a stark contrast of what happened in the fourth quarter but once again bubble and Mariano fish played big minutes and had a huge impact on this game and even showed off the jumper tonight\nOr he knocked down a little mid range jumper um you know the interesting thing was talking with Dr for the ball game we were asking about what's the threshold for bowl bond is there a ...\nLaw of diminishing returns for him and doc said\nWithout really moving you know not being jokey like we're going to find out we're going to find out how many minutes we can play him if it's twenty five of its thirty which is probably unlikely but they're going to push it\nOr he probably would have got more minutes but it wasn't very effective in that first half which is fine again he's not effective in the first half comes back it as a difference maker when the clippers needed it most I think he played most of the fourth quarter he and she just Alexander so\nI I I'm just I like this team and it's again it's a collective effort you know you don't have that superstar maybe\nDon't tell Tobias Harris that now so ... that\nCould this be one of those moments we look back upon and say this is when Tobias Harris put his stamp on on this team as a Clipper and was more of a leader when you can pull out a game like this when you did not have your shot and you still had all that confidence to keep shooting yourself out of it I mean what can I Do for his confidence moving forward I think\nHe's a confident guy but to do this Adam when you're down and then you when to me is a big deal like we've seen in the the the envy history books have it all over the place\nTerrible team do you guys are averaging big ... big numbers and and ridiculous number empty numbers renting calories because they don't do anything to have a double double and have sixth consecutive shots to come out with a when\nIt's a big deal but it is only one game but I have faith and Tobias I think he's going to be terrific and I think the needle going is going to continue to be great\nIf the other guys that I think need to step up and\nLet let's just be real like then I think ... Bradley Beverly are going to be great they're they've been very poor now defensively they'd been everywhere Bradley was terrific and Paul George so we talk about the seven for twenty seven\n... Bradley had a huge hand and that's always often isn't there yet he was one for five this is a guy that should average anywhere from ten to Fifteen points a game and shoot in the high thirties from beyond the arc\nHe's not there yet I'm not worried it will come to the fact of the matter is you're starting back court goes what uh do the math I'm not very good at math very well there are two for Thirteen and they go to for aid from the New York and I believe combined your pet Beverly was over eight\nIn game one and yet they found a way to get a win here tonight those guys are going to get it done is going to become more efficient as the season goes on but I liked the scrapping is I like I I guess my takeaway is Tobias shaking off those ten minutes is it's tough to overcome\nAnd you could certainly go into a little shoulder slump and wonder why me he did not want the opposite way\nAnd I saw it in for the team as a whole\nList seemed clear to me they're off and start a fuel their defense and the rebounding and Tobias Harris had ten boards in this game once he started making more shots it seemed like he also got active in the paint defensively and was wherever the ball ended up even though Steven Adams was out there grab an Eighteen boards tonight [laughter] I really think one will feed\nThe other and we've always heard from when you're a kid in in the YMCA ball that a defense leads too often but in this situation with this team was so many defensive minded players\nGetting the stop is going to be huge because they have guys that can get out and transition that could finish from beyond the arc or finish out the ram a ... honestly\nThis sounds like a crazy thing to say but if the clippers are top ten defense I'd be stunned if they're not a top ten often says well based off of them just getting some easier shots in transition and having guys that can fill it up and get hot so\nUh as I mentioned that started last game of the clippers are the only team in the NBA in the top ten off and so last seven years so you're saying big deal you have Christian Blake who did you have last year for them to get it done last year says it all and I don't see why any reason they wouldn't be a top ten off ants\nWith this group that to me is infinitely more talented than last year a squad the clippers\nContinues to go through well a gauntlet in the western conference Sunday they're taking on the Houston Rockets right here at staples Centre tip times at six PM\nYour clippers countdown show will start on am five Seventy at five PM be we will talk to you then because my friend alright coming up next on your post game show we'll get to all the highlights in this clippers come back\nThey beat the okay see thunder went away to Ninety to ... this is your slippers radio network [noise]\n\nClippers fans don't lose your chance to experience the action live with tickets from vivid seats the official ticket resale marketplace of LA Clippers visit C. dot com backslash slippers today to buy and sell tickets to any of this phone\nGames on the road even sold out they have no problem and every transaction is backed by are\nOne hundred percent buyers guarantee vivid\nSeats let you see more closer season tickets available now vivid seats dot com backslash clippers\nYou know what comes in handy knowing things ahead of time for instance if I knew ahead of time that this hot sauce was made with Trinidad scorpion peppers I might have used a little less [noise]\nTalking about an unwanted surprised like falling in love with a car before you know you can afford it well the mind finance application at ... dot com and helps you get some of that financed opt out of the way ahead of time so you could avoid feeling burned [noise]\nFelt please ...

think he was just five uh fourteen in game one we saw how good he had been in the pre season he was shooting the ball as well as ever he looked like the same guy from Denver that has had multiple forty point games that was the leading score\nOn a Denver team that won fifty seven games\nBefore he tours ACL back in twenty twelve\nHe looks good he ends Tobias Harris both had twenty six points in this game this is a little bit more of what we expected it just took a while for the clippers to get here\nBecause they look to be out worked at times in this game because the thunder are really good scrappy team with a lot of athletes that plays defence that gets off into rebounds they've led the league and all kinds of rebounding the last three seasons\nAnd they have ... and Stephen Adams [laughter]\nIt looks like that actor Jason ... a little bit now with the hair and even though ... huge on the big screen I'm pretty sure Steven Adams would dwarf him yet Seventeen and Eighteen in this game he played great he reminds me of\nScott Pollard a much better version of him I'm sure Brian would appreciate that's in power went to a Kansas [laughter]\nBut Steven Adams was going to be a problem and he was and the rebels were problem and the clippers still overcame it\nThat's what you have to like about tonight's when they didn't play their best basketball and they're still found a way to get a victory when it looked like they were lost again off ... were the chemistry just wasn't there that she wasn't matching\nAnd I think part of the reason honestly is because they have more options now than what they had last year\nDoc rivers had to go with that kitchen sink approach of just throwing everything he can out there to try to win a game with whatever players were available to him that night and now he has all these options all these players as at his disposal\nAnd he's got to figure out what lineup she likes and how to make this thing work and get this off ... clicking which has been one of the best off and says going back seven years now yes that included Blake in CPA three but last year off and it was a top ten off and even with all the injuries going on\n\nWhat the personnel on this team we've been wondering can they be an elite defensive team they look like that at times in this game\nBut they still haven't put it together for four quarters yet which is kind of scared because they still won this game by sixteen yes Russell Westbrook was not out there for the okay see thunder but the defense on poll George\nTo the point he only shot seven of twenty seven from the floor made a surgeon that third quarter had Thirteen of us twenty points there but for the most part he was kept in check by every Bradley\nSo even though his shot wasn't working tonight which is one of eight from the floor some open shots you just missed the ... the clippers still miss a ton of gimme he's in this\nGame like the seven labs they missed in game one there were more of those bunnies underneath a basket and the pain that just just did not fall for them [noise]\nBut I thought one player who went over five last game came out\nAnd played a great game and limited minutes Lou Bob ... went three of three had seven points in Nineteen Minutes he also provided a lot of that help defensively and was part of one of the line ups that helped make a run for this clippers team\nSo the clippers when one oh eight to Ninety two over the thunder they moved to one on one on the year it's still early but they are playing some really good\nTeams right now twenty other first thirty games are against playoff opponents from last year so while this ... clippers team is still figuring things out they have to find ways to win games and not get too far back in the standings to win the schedule opens up a little bit\nIf they were five hundred is our first thirty games I think they probably sign up for that considering some of the opponents on the schedule coming up\nEight seven seven five to zero eleven fifty is the phone number if you'd like to get on tonight we do have audio from doc rivers after this clippers victory we'll hear from Tobias Harris later on we'll look for some more player audio for you shake you'll just Alexander by the way I just had two points\nThe long yeah and they just watch each other\nThey're they're kind of over each other you know meaning that\nThey they just want to win the game um\nYou know back in and they were the first guys out on the floor um you know as you know it's funny like for say doing time out she got bad telling them something they reject them some of them like geez\nI Hope he's not listening to everybody right now but they're doing it because they want them to do well you know I'm\nNot defensively and the second after she was ... was the other guy that that you know you may one three you're not going to talk a lot about what he did but I thought it was even simple Georgia Newman Avery throughout the game I thought they made it hard night a football\nCoach what winning your decision what keeps the on the ... the whole fourth quarter they're just playing well you know\nA theater got tired of taking them out and in battery we would have come in um but I just like the way that unit with four\nOf you know it's early in the only two games but at some point in our neighbors shootings

I'll say it again or with this team the whole is greater than the sum of its parts they elevate one another in its early in this season and a lot of the guys that are playing now\nWere injured last year and this is a new team\nBut the attitude and the will to win seemed to remain the same I Love what I saw from Lou Williams tonight who liked in the yellow gallon Ari and doc rivers also highlighted his performance in the third quarter when the clippers couldn't score he had ten of his twenty six points in that third quarter\nBut Lou Williams also started looking for his shot\nBecause he was keenly aware that the all fences buttered for the clippers\nAnd it is a role that Lou was very comfortable with taking over taking difficult shots making difficult shots go into his left getting defenders off balance and drawing foul she was seven of seven from the free throw line\nThe scene was struggling at one point from the line he stepped up and I wouldn't say this is stepping up because he shoots almost eighty percent for his career from the ... five of seven from the free throw line\nHalf of his points have come at the line this season\nAre so many big men struggle with feeling like they're playing papa shot because their hands are so big it's a free throw line well I have a hard time buying any of those excuses when you see both bought out there with a perfect stroke at the charity striped\nMean Nazi Germany had this romantic belief in the area and cultural superiority based on nature's laws all dressed up in political pseudo scientific biology and it was often encouraged we'd be logical apocalyptic ideas that certain people\nWere burden on resources and the environment and some argue that many people believe that in order to bring balance to nature\nWe had to do a limited certain people we had to kill off some of the population so people were rounded up and killed\nMeans centuries prior we had European columnist who took the land for the natives because they were believed to be a strain on the resources their beliefs were different than the puritan belief and so\nThey hunted them down and kill them see there's always this\nAffected process for creating an agreed upon way of hunting down and killing other human beings in order to boost some sort of agenda in order to make you feel better about your belief system because these are believes that you don't necessarily agree with it so when you have like for example the times I'm assuming which trials\nThere were governors who are complicit in carrying out a lot of the atrocities and the public trust is always exploited in situations like bees\nAnd it would be opinion of the political elite the day but these changes the b._b._c. that we're seeing where actually happening because there was this work going on this working out\nOf the devil is like today that there was a polarization of the people on on one side we have the devil and the other side we add God and in between there was something else and there was black magic being used in other ways of trying to\nGet to take care of the governors take care of the leaders go against the bankers it's just a never ending process in fact\nThomas sharing it on our show today we're talking about the attack that's being planned tomorrow on justice cabinet and I mean a lot of these actions have not been\nYou know a lot of the uh uh different people have very views on what this is going to do it's going to take place where there's a guy by the name of father Gary Thomas\nAnd he's The Exorcist for the diocese of San jose California He's offering a mass for Kavanaugh tomorrow and basically he's the guy that was the subject of a ... uh the twenty ... book the right\nTo making of a modern extra system that was a movie in twenty eleven twelve years is becoming an actress is father Thomas who said that he he's terrified of what is going on just like Thomas in fact father Gary\nOn ground zero and you know when we were talking earlier about this thing and how it represents the serpent and the serpent teen and be and be empowering the female and the male and the and the fruit and all that\nFather Gary said that in some of his extra systems\nHe has been known to you know put his hands are annoying or lay his hands on people during the extra system had they been known to turn into or at least appeared to be Seventeen or appear to be reptilian he appeared on the show when the right was popular let's play that segment from father Gary Thomas listen to that\nThere's more of an increase of reports of shapes shift as if you've heard of that before or father when you say a shape shift of what you mean\nPeople who are able to and I've seen one I've seen a person change their their their confidence where they're able to change their look all the I's dark and they get large and yet you've seen this\nYes I have and I've also seen when you said as soon as you I I wanted to make sure that I understood which ...

nonsense but now that they've convinced a lot of Americans that\nAlready won election was changed because of this this can this is highly repeatable you can do this over and over it's not that difficult and you don't have to be successful I because they took all contacts out of the discussion there was no longer\nDid they change votes did this actually shift the election and any particular state or or in any meaningful way or was this just throwing out there some means and some fake Facebook stuff and that shifted perception you can never really gauge how much impact that\nShift had but it did something and something means that you can always say the election was tainted now Russia or China or Iran any country doesn't even have to be sophisticated\nThey have the ability to with a minimum of any financial outlay with a minimum of of anything from there and they can\nAffect the outcome of an election right they they can change how much a trust we have an electoral process and if you are looking to\nUndermine democracy the great irony here\nIs that because the left and the Democrats hyper ventilated so much about the last Russian interference campaign everyone that comes after this is likely to be in greatly exaggerated in the minds of a lot of people\nAnd now whenever and whenever one side of the political aisle loses there'll be at least some faction\nWithin it that can say she change election you know that's what this election was marred by outside efforts to try to change things so and I would also note that the Russians and the Chinese maybe even the Iranians they're going to get more sophisticated doing this to\n... they're not going to just stop at these relatively ... minor and knock us space but campaigns ah some of the other things that I've been going on they're going to get more advanced\nBut back to this this federal complaint that just came out today or this is what it says in the journal piece ms ... nova so I don't know how you say that 'cause you know a\nA managed the effort called project locked which targeted the U.S election and worked with a total operating budget of more than thirty five million dollars between January twenty sixteen and June twenty Eighteen the complaint said\n... uh miss K all call her played a key role and what project lack of describe this information warfare against the United states\nInformation warfare is a pretty strong way of saying getting them to try to vote for one side of the political aisle\nOr the other um remember they're not trying to convince us do have a a bloody revolution the streets they're trying to convince people to vote for drop or vote for Hillary or vote for whomever uh but I just think that we've lost\nWe lost so much of the ability to contextualize this ... and understand what really matters what's really important and and what's not\nUm they're they're getting way ahead of their skis on this one so we've gotten out now we've got the OJ charges about Russian interference in midterms who wants to guess whether the Democrats are going to wait and see how they do in the mid term before making a big deal of this\nAll of a sudden they're gonna on earth a lot more is going to be so much more reporting on this one based on who wins or who doesn't so will stay on this I also want to talk to you about the mob\nOr mom's on the streets and the massive\nCaravan

you look like you're sad and tired and an hungry and needy from a country that's in bad shape and I'm not saying\nYou know that's all that's all very valid and but if you shop one of those countries do you just automatically get to stay because then we got a few hundred million people that I think really deserve to be in America right away\nAnd Democrats won't admit this but they're unwilling to tell all those people you do not get to stay in this country um but there's been a confrontation\nOn the on the border dishes are from USA Today a caravan of us bound migrants broke down a border crossing friday and streamed onto a bridge on Mexico's southern border with Guatemala in the face of a heavy presence of Mexican Guatemalan law enforcement officers\nAre according to media reports the travelers up to four thousand people mostly from Honduras were stopped on the river crossing\nBy the U.S base Spanish language network Telemundo\nSome members of the caravan became so desperate they

that\nYou know want to be in America I get that but this is a massive people and they're trying to overwhelm the border that's what this is we can't process the mall we cannot deal with them all they know this and so they show up and this is really using\nOur humanitarian impulses in this country against us and that's a you know you either believing sovereignty believe in law and order or you don't\nAnd I know it's so easy to say just taken everybody but just remember that as you look at what's going on and a lot of communities that have had\nTremendous financial strain put on them by the

and so when they bring up the care of their assault we need to do is to bring up the pictures of children being separated from their family\nSo there there you have a a selection of what they're going to say this is going to be one of the biggest issues\nAre in the mid term election right now I think or one of the biggest news items I should say that could affect the midterms and that's all by design\nBut you notice they say things like Trump just stokes fear about this is all about Trump stoking fear and fear people from the south you're ... if you're around people that will say you know anyone who's non white that they say all the same things all the time\nWhat is the Democrats allusion to this I mean that's somehow we never get to that question we never get\nTo post that we never get to hear the answer is what we hear a lot of flowery rhetoric a lot of oh but you know what we need is what we need a comprehensive immigration reform right what we need is an immigration system that works the immigration system is broken\nThey say all that stuff what does that mean what does it mean how do you fix it other than amnesty do they want the border to continue being as it is okay let's not even get into it as something vis\nA you know open ended in and widespread let let's take it at the very straightforward level of what you Democrats want when it comes to this caravan of people what is their plan\nShould the United states government say oh okay four thousand people who are just going to show up in a mass at the border\nShould be allowed to stay in the country we should just bring them in\n... I I think that is what they said oh that due process for something they're all from Honduras well we know they're going to say you know where to hundreds is very violent we don't want to go back we just want to be in America okay and you say All right well\nYou know we've got one for four thousand more people yes of course right we've got run for when you say room but what does that really mean\nYeah we've got\nSpace is late we've got a lot of open spaces country but people need resources and they have\nYou know they want they want political representation and they they're it's it's not just to be in a place it's also to be supported in that place say okay but we got obviously were very wealthy country got enough for four thousand ...\nWhat about the next ten thousand auto that that that's not no I Would want to ask Democrat members of Congress asked Democrats senators what\nDo we do in the next gang that shows up is I don't mean gangs and like gang bangers but you know what I mean the next uh a group that X\nMass of people they call it a caravan right this is the tournaments and they try to use ... what do we do in the next caravan shows up of of ten thousand people\nOkay we're going to let we let them in\nDoing letting the next ten caravans of ten thousand people each after that why would anybody why would\nAnybody wait years and years pay thousands of dollars and deal with all kinds of annoying headaches and I know they're not it's not fun and a lot of times it's not fair\nWhy do that if all you have to do is show up in Mexico walk to the border and say I'm fleeing a very dangerous situation in my home country well what were your papers while I'm undocumented\nI Can't prove that well even speak Spanish no no I don't know how do I know you're from Honduras or you don't but why don't we figured out the immigration courts let me into America oh I get my court date in four years great I'll be sure to show up for that one see then\nWhy would anyone waste their time right that this is the way to do it just go to Mexico show up at the border but show up in a big group\nBecause the optics of it which is what they're playing off of your are oh we can't turn away this big group that looks really mean now we're going to have a well we don't want to look mean immigration policy every other country in the world has a we don't want to look mean immigration policy or rather\nThey're willing to have a we will look me immigration policy that don't tell people you get 'em in\nEvery other countries is no sorry you know just get to come and stay here and say well you know America is different alright there's there are other wealthy country should there are plenty of places people could go\nPlenty of countries they could go to um people in

make how much\nDo you miss her to you know we want her to give you a little mom does the so you remember what it was like when you had to deal with Hillary all the\nTime [noise]\nAh yes Hillary you've probably think to yourself like most normal people would oh Hillary is run for president unsuccessfully twice there's no way that she would be show\nDiluted and so self involved in so self important and Meg Whitman article that\nShe would run again but all I Do listen to that ... and fellow sometimes on the radio he can be quite an impish little little dude and uh she has been saying for the last year regularly that Hillary Clinton may run again\nAnd I keep saying I Know everyone can say I'm Crazy I\nKnow everyone's going to tell me I'm nuts but oh guess what a you know it's gotten first time that I can think of at least twenty Eighteen you have a top\nA Clinton aide Felipe rains who's a veteran spokesmen and console yes they\nAre saying that yes\nIt's a it's possible here's resent his political quote it's curious why Hillary Clinton's name isn't in the mix either conversational or and former former polling as eight twenty twenty candidate\nShe's younger the Donald Trump by year she's younger than Joe Biden by four years is that she's run before\nThis would be Bernie Sanders second time and by the third time is it lack of support jihad sixty five million people vote for her it was a mistake for Democrats to punish Clinton from mistakes you made and twenty sixteen\nShocking last up to her being a failed candidate isn't over simplification she is smarter than most tougher than most she could raise money easier than most it was an absolute fight to the debt\nWhen asked about the likelihood of a running range responded is somewhere between highly unlikely and zero but it is not\nZero now let me tell you something right now\nAre there is a very very higher than zero much more realistic possibility than they're willing to talk about a ... that she will run and that's why they're starting it's as you are right now in terms of what the public really we're expecting one what they're trying to do\nIs just start start rehabilitating that perception they have to take it upon themselves to\nMake the case which is what I hear the Hillary wonder if I'm selling all along there's an entire apparatus of people around her\nWho believed that the height of their careers would come when she won that election they have not gone away they have not achieve what they set out to achieve which was to get those different jobs\nThey all have the drapes picked out for their officers they were ready to go and that was all taken from they believe taken from them by the Russians I\nThey believe taken from them by this uh this unholy alliance between ... and Trump and all these terrible shenanigans that went on behind the scenes or so the narrative is I've been telling you is that the only way to set right what happened in the past the only way to make it all better\nWas if they were able to now bring Hillary back and make her the president yes she will be the third time around but give Felipe rain some credit here he's telling the truth about her age about number of times running\nIt makes more sense for her Hillary around that Biden or Bernie makes more sense first woman candidate won all those she beat burning in the last primary but this is also how desperate they are for a candidate that the case for Hillary from a Democrat perspective the case\nFor Hillary is more rational then the case for most of the other\nCandidates that the Democrats are thinking about right now and they just you know what it is they just can't stomach it they just feel like they had to just show down a lot of nasty stuff\nIn order to push her once again after Obama came out of nowhere in that primary defeat or they they have to do this or they had to do it\nAnd there was a recognition I think deep down with a lot of them that they may have to do it again\nAnd they will they will I'm telling you I think the chance that Hillary Clinton runs right now if you're really to give Vegas odds on this is more along the lines of twenty five percent\nI'm not saying it's likely but I'm saying it's a serious serious shot that she\nDecides to run and men would not just while\nWe can replace what he's sixteen election in twenty twenty\nAnd all the same cast of characters all over again\n[noise] I mean I'm I'm a I'm not sure if people would know it would be a ... it would be a ratings bonanza and the good news is folks that\nAre very confident but if that were to happen and guess what\nFrom what\nAnd the show every day because I get to share my thoughts with\nAll of you all across the country and in some cases all over the\nIt's incredible but I also want you to be able to share your thoughts with me and with each other and not have to worry about left wing biased or any of these social media moderators that decide that you're going to get Shadow Bear or you're just not going to see things in your feet anymore than are conservative you know you can't talk\nGuns 'cause that that one of the second amendment oh that must be bad Jew Snoopy dot\nWhy why why somebody who lives about his drinking\nHe didn't this was one of the more pathetic lives about Kavanaugh he didn't lie about his drinking\nHe said he drank sometimes sometimes too much when you start to try to play around with well look it's not too much like way way too much so it's a law that is completely subjective and that in in no\nRational universe does that would that qualify as perjury or but you heard people saying oh there's a lot about his drinking he did not live out his ... he said he didn't blackout and he said that he would drink too much sometimes\nAnd the Democrats went so far is to try to put high school and college beer drinking on trial in an effort to try to stop that but it was pathetic which goes to show that\nThey have no scruples nothing stops them nothing prevents them from you know just going all\nIn all this stuff but that was Ted Cruz in an airport being heckled I'm being you know yelled at by people who are truly angry at him and I wish I could be there well for a lot of reasons one is you just said them Ted Cruz didn't do anything to you\nYou would never occur to me and I know never heard any of you listening to this to go up to a stranger and just start getting up in that person's face and yelling at them\nBecause of what they stand for publicly when it just it just would never occur to me now\nI'm not saying to talk to somebody to engage somebody and if he was elected representatives go to but this is yelling this is heckling citizen trying to have a conversation and this is not\nMeant you in any way be constructive they're they're not engaging Ted Cruz they're mouthing Ted Cruz this is what they do they like the foreign mobs\nAnd also reminded me when she started to say all these women came forward and tell their stories\nThis was a sensitive area of the whole Cavanaugh a situation that I don't think I spoke to much about it and it's not because I I was unwilling to her didn't want to you I just had so much else going on there\nBut you had all these women who were coming forward and we're telling their stories of being sexually assault\nAnd that's if if any woman who wants to do that that's obviously her right and she deserves you know support and sympathy\nBut that created this very dangerous to due process phenomenon of well it it because something\nBad happened to me and the person lied and got away with it or because I didn't bring charges a because someone attacked me speaking again for other people who are in the third person it means that this this case should be influenced\nBy that that's that's crazy this is just\nA it's not just a foul it's not just a logical fallacy it's a dangerous thing for people to believe you imagine if I\nHad a uh I I was on trial for a steely right I was in ... for fraud and people started showing up at my trial and they were saying well someone stole from me so he must be guilty\nYou'd say well that's irrelevant it's completely irrelevant but for the left it was a widespread\nTalking point the whole cabinet thing you'd hear people I I I saw other people that I Know from the media world too are there are other talking heads you said you know I I Want to come forward and talk about my sexual assault now and again that's fine for context and background and all that\nBut just because somebody was sexually assaulted by some guy who's not Brett Kavanaugh\nDoes not mean that that has anything to do with whether Brett Kavanaugh is guilty of any kind of sexual assault or not this is really elementary stuff\nAnd that this was a something that people are losing sight of a lot of people are losing sight of just I think went to show how completely over the top and an over politicize this entire thing had had become\nA there there is a a mass\nHysteria in this country the Democrats have reached this point where I don't think that the king ah logically about many of these issues they just want to show emotion they want to show rage and they want to signal there virtue of the world\nAnd they don't want to engage in debates or or discussions on any of this they just expect that other people will listen to them other people here are their thoughts and because ... there's so much claiming a victim status now when everyone's saying oh I'm a victims do you have to listen to me\nAh their expectation is that they won't have to justify\nThese ideas that that the justification just comes from the emotion behind it and from the identity of the particular speaker of the justification that becomes well because I feel this way um everyone else has to value my thoughts on it because I suffered some terrible tragedy it was very\nTroubling to see this happening and it's a mob mentality to bring this back to the Trump is saying here you know do you want people who easily get swept up into mob thinking\nTo be the ones who are electing representatives who also whip up the mob in this way and you know there's been not nearly enough condemnation\nOf the kinds of tactics that he left has been embracing recently and I think there's been a lot well we know there's a lot of endorsing of it but it's been not nearly\nA enough and I find that a fund that\nDisquieting to say the least so there you have but you know we're gonna talk disquieting stupid celebrities are all over the place you know there's all\nKinds of dumped celebrities everywhere

that what it turns out that ah that there are people who take fairy tales literally um but if we're going to talking about celebrities who\nI I don't know how it is that they are treated with as

sure\nOh yeah the results show that lives with word can't do math or isn't very smart or both or or is just I think I think delusional that's probably the most likely outcome there but Nikki Haley of did a good job at the Al Smith dinner\nAnd it was she had some great opportunities there and she took them with with some good jokes\nAnd I do think that her move all long hair has been she's good with she's in good with the Trump people she's going to help Donald Trump when a second term she is a perfect candidate to run\nA once Trump has had a second term I I don't people are saying pants I

that's it's just going to be at the end exactly what I thought which is that they the Saudis are going to say that this was a rogue operation um but\nBeating up on Trump was clearly what a lot of this has been about all along\nAnd I you know and and Bernie Sanders sometimes I get a little caught up it was like the only person who's ... who's like burn the it's burned these now and the mood is right

dishonest at this as a line of attack against Trump and against everybody around him is just going for the lowest common denominator and its mudslinging and place of ideas mudslinging and in place of policy and I had I had to laugh without one I don't even know was was calm and his\nMom full of let's say liberal tears up and I'm just like like my church right now are real like it's like why are they doing this to me\nI Wish that they would also get a little bit more of a sense of humor a sense of humor that didn't revolve around mocking and ridiculing are Christians and a white males all the time\nI mean white males we can take it I mean the stuff about Christians that they do is particularly a nasty you know that's really it's not meant to be laughing with its laughing at all the time\nBut liberals don't have a sense of humor anymore and this is why you see these polls about political correctness and how anybody who's paying attention knows a political correctness is a cancer in our society it\nIs destructive it doesn't add anything to society doesn't make us better as people it just creates a incentives to make politics all about personal destruction and also allows some of the most\nAnnoying stone faced on unhappy miserable petty people in our society to get to write and then rewrite rules that all the rest of us have to live all the time\nI've said it before it's really important Trump got a lot of support in the early days because he just said political correctness is garbage you just said it's garbage you didn't say oh you know we shouldn't be so politically correct but I understand why people are coming from it no no no\nIt's garbage and it is so destructive to society so destructive to uh our ability to talk to each other as normal people have normal conversation\nI get frustrated I city or I Do the show there's so many times where I think that's a joke that I could make it'll it'll run through my mind as I can make that joke and Ninety nine percent of\nThe people listening of you who the wonderful people listen to the show who do really means so much to me every day Ninety nine percent of you will be like oh that's really funny or maybe maybe even you know Ninety percent of you would think it was funny nine percent of you would think man wasn't that great\nAnd then one percent though of the lives listening or one percent of the people that includes media matters and some of the other maniacs that listen to the show out they would have a problem with it and they would take it and try to twist it and use it as a weapon against me and it's just\nNot worth the risk\nAnd it's really hard to do any kind of comedy is really hard to ... because comedy entails risks right you're you're you're trying to push down and you're trying to I'm I'm not a comedian but I Do some funny stuff here and there\nAnd I certainly wish I could do even more amusing uh takes on commentary on politics and I do but it's I just know that you know you you run up against this\nAh this third rail that's a mobile third rail I that they it's not like it stays in one place you don't know how close you get into it because they'll change the rules and they'll change what's going on around you based upon their ability to get ya when they want when they want to get you it's just that so inspiring going back to the\nThe way that they're using these calls of racism and massaging these allegations as really a primary a primary means to get people to go out and vote for Democrats that's the best they can do\nYou know I I they're they're talking about health care a little bit and basically Trump is a racist and Trump is massage and this and all these other things you know they they also seem to forget that we haven't\nForgotten that\nBill Clinton hey ladies haven't seen a little while I Want you to come over who wants to take a selfie with me\nJust watch words out of hand goes you know I just don't know it's got a mind of its own you know Bill Clinton's out there as somebody who is still very respecting Democrats articles in fact Hillary went out and said recently there was no power imbalance with the president of United States she sent us an interview\nWhat was in a week ago\nThere was no no no power imbalance between the United states\nAn injured in the White House that he was having a\nRelations relations with um she's still she still will say stuff like that and of course she thinks she's still running for president which is\nIt should give us all a nightmare as how long but it really should be this stuff is a bad dreams but I think it it could become a reality before before too long\nThis is the thing that ... there's a there's a joy listening is at the heart of of the Democrat\nPolitical ideology these days it's all about\nMaking sure that no one you know that there used to be this old I forget who it is or who said it I Want to say it Mencken but it might not be Jamaican but you know a a puritan is somebody who lives with a constant fear that someone somewhere might be having a good time\nAnd you find that increasingly tree of Democrats you know a Democrat is somebody who's constantly in fear of someone\nSomewhere saying anything interesting radical new different you know breaking down old paradigms\nAnd enjoying themselves while they do it you know enjoying themselves while they try to\nChallenge the dominant political orthodoxy Democrats get terrified by that show\nDesire conformity and discussions all the time in fact they desire telling you what words you can use in the discussion and and who can who can use what kinds of words\nSo many constraints put on this all always I mean I just it would be easy for me to switch you know in in my head if I Want it to you and and become a Democrat just call everybody every consider everyone the other side is racist all the time everything is sexism everything is intersection ...\nIt's just exhausting though isn't it just to think that way\nYou you think about what it really must be like to be some of these\nUh just joyous radical feminist that I've seen recently and had to talk to a few times\nIn the last few months because the whole Kavanaugh situation who really do think of women as this terribly oppressed and marginalized minority in society you know they're actually my new majority by population\nBut they really think of themselves this way and there's a constant\nChip on the shoulder attitude for all their interactions with men always it's just not a good way to go through life it's just not a a happy healthy way to beat and increasingly I think for Democrats\nYou know it's a it's like a sugar high politically you know oh you got to do all the virtue signaling and he's got to feel like you're so brave and tall on issues where you're taking what is the most convenient issue for you politically socially and professionally\nAs a Democrat um but at the end days isn't it just\nDoesn't feel kind of hallowed and never have to really engage the other side and just call them racist and massaging is\nI don't know I Hope people think about this as they go in and they vote or they think about whether
