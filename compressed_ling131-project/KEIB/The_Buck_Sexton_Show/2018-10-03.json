I mean I I ... I don't tell people to buy a home when they're in that okay so if you call me ahead of time I was told you ought to buy but this house is not like you know if you call me up you're making thirty eight hundred dollars your house payments Fifteen hundred dollars now we got a problem\nI'm going to put that house on the market but your house payment is way less than a fourth of your take on pay\nAnd so you're fine I mean it's really not your problem I think you guys are just starting to budget and uh the emotional weight of a a of dealing with the medical situation you're facing and when you're with your baby I mean when you're babies' heart and they're just that's just it just wears you down you know\nIt just makes you human her makes you a good daddy and a good mommy but according to the truth is it makes it kind of hard to see past ah I'm just looking at the ... numbers right now I don't ... I mean I I feel for you guys are pray for you but I don't have the emotional weight\nThat you guys have got facing the stuff you face every day dealing with this situation\nYou know so that's just very real a ... but but the math actually you know thirty eight hundred bucks minus nine hundred dollars\nMinus a eight hundred dollars for a house payment or you know minus food on a slide show modest water doesn't leave a lot of room but you could pay your payments on everything doing that\nAnd then you could pick up your overtime and start making some headway on some of these deaths and cleaning them often as they these little that's clean all these credit cards outstanding medical bills in student loans clean off\nYou know over the next year and a half two years you're going to start having a little bit of wiggle room and you guys will keep moving forward and head but I I think that's the you're just\nYou know you're just feeling the weight of all of this and it's kind of clouding it's this is doable though where you are is doable I think you can pull it off no I Would not sell your house or would not have bought it because I don't ... to buy a house where we got that but\nIt's your house is not like when I hear those numbers are my like what are you crazy none of that so there none of it you're you're it's very very reasonable\nFor your situation now would it help if you earn an extra thousand bucks a month you're dead gum writer clean this mess up faster two thousand bucks a month even faster so are you have you got a couple of years are really hard work and lots of overtime inside jobs ahead of you yup you sure do\nAre you guys gonna be taking a bunch of fans who vacations new you got a bunch of that you're cleaning up after reality but hold on I'll have Kelly pick up we're going to get your copy of the total money make over book and give it to ya and\nHelp get you started and if you need some more help you call me I'll help you in any way I can I'm Sorry you guys are facing all these challenges but I think you're up for it I think you can do the math makes sense to me that you're giving me unless there's something we left out of this equation so thank you for the call Josh is with us in Los Angeles Hi Josh how are you\nGood how are you doing Dave better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] not too much I've got a question for you among baby steps which is pay off my house early [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't have any other debt because my house I have a six month emergency fun um but I kinda did all your stuff out of order because I've never really liked that but anyway um [noise] I have a hundred and sixty four thousand dollars less to pay off my house\nBut I also have about a hundred thousand dollars invested in mutual funds and stuff like that and I'm curious\nWould it be wiser to um take a hundred thousand dollars out of my personal investment cook at all for the house and then just pay off the remaining sixty four thousand or should I leave that money invested and the money that I have every month just accelerate payment from my house\n... what's your household income uh probably about a hundred and fifty thousand so you could be like debt free and when you were if you did the\nUm yeah yeah I'd be done by the end of next year I'm sure if I if I took the hundred thousand for the court house\nOkay if your house was paid for and you didn't have any money and investments would you borrow a hundred thousand on your home to\nPutting investments [noise] know same thing in a\nUm I don't follow okay well\nI mean if you have a hundred thousand dollars in an investment and you take it out of the investment in order to put in and pay off your home that's the same thing in reverse if you didn't do that it's the same thing as if you if you leave it in the investment it's the same thing is borrowing on your home to invest isn't it\nGot it yeah\nOkay so it's a balance sheet equation meaning that balance sheet is where you list your assets on one side of the pager liabilities on the other side of the page\nAnd right and you can switch them back and forth by borrowing money meaning if you were sitting there with no investments paid for house you could you could borrow money and put you know money you got that over there on that one side of the page but on the other side of the ... now you'd have an investment right\nAnd all I'm doing is on doing that by asking the question in reverse though it's a bit of a trick I kind of ... ah the trick is that it makes you think not just with your head but also with your heart\nAnd I always like to think of when my my head is where I Do math in my heart for a measure risk\nAnd your real risk averse you hate that like I Do yeah and so the idea of borrowing on a paid for house chagrin investment as absurd and your mind\nYeah I mean you immediately reacted but that's a heart thing she that's where that's at risk bark that's ... that you're measuring this cause you to do that you didn't stop and do math you went you recoiled and what not that crazy in your mind right you know\nAnd that that but and and start by asking it in reverse so all of that to say yes I Do the hundred grand at it in a heartbeat I assume this was not in a retirement account no penalties right\n[noise] [noise] uh no that that a hundred thousand is just pursuing that right yeah and the only thing is I mean you're talking about the head and the heart and that just with\nThe mathematics of it ... if you'd ... by if you put risk getting the mathematics of it and it changes the mathematics and so and so your heart is actually correct your heart is helping you do a complete measure the amount\nOf ... and so yes I take the money out of their house I'll be ...\nShe's actually what I knew\nThey guy just ... senior executive producer of the day Ramsey show this hour of the show is over\nBut you can also watch them on ...

I can tell you having watched the interview shoes and she's a liar because she changed her statement from what the official statement was you don't get to go from oh I I was one declaration saying that Brett Kavanaugh spiked punch at a party and then say well he was standing next to the punch it might have spiked it\n\nI don't know if any do saw or how many of you saw the Julie sweating interviews aired on NBC NBC which also we may get to later has\nVarious versions of an untrue story trying to say that Kavanaugh was causing problems about the Ramirez testimony she was the second woman didn't testify just give us warns Dayton but the remembers allegation\nBut hold that thought for a moment\nSweat Nick is the one who says the Kavanaugh was president for gang rapes and that there were gang rape parties in the DC area sweat it also well I'll break down all of the reasons why she's\nI don't think she's mistaken Dr Ford may be mistaken I think she's a very troubled woman I think that she has a lot of issues and I think that she may which she makes clear by telling us and she's got as you should just happens to blame her she was on Brett Kavanaugh but I think he has issues completely apart from Kevin ... but\nShe may very well believe what she said and as I've told you hear\nI Witness testimony leads to a lot of innocent people go into prison with his testimony can be very problematic on its own\nUm but sweat Nick is not confused sweat Nick is not somebody who just is\nTo be ... and and might be making a mistake that's destroying someone's life here's just a part\nOf the kind of things that she was saying this interview and then and then I'll tell you why I Know that she's lying and then we have to evaluate what was the third person that the media treated as serious and said oh gosh this needs to be investigated if she's a liar\nDo we get to look at the second person who also has a shady stories that you know maybe there's a pattern here maybe all these leftist females who are coming forward at a moment of peril for roe v Wade maybe they're doing it for political reasons or we're we're not supposed to have that conversation bowl I Want to have that\nConversation it's a man's life his reputation his honor his dignity hand in the balance hang in the balance and a a Supreme Court seat hangs in the balance as well\n\nHere's some of the sweat Nick interview that aired yesterday play to\nWhat is it going to say well I tell what happened when it happened to me I didn't put ten and Cather that I have boys photo outside and rose congregated together sort of like an outlet\nAnd I didn't know what was it for a ballot for al ... a lot of laughing I'm calling in line outside or anything or wind definitely huddled vibe door I oh I didn't notice for what it could possibly ...\nAnyone to get their way they're watching out numbered\nBurning are holding them for about ... or ...\nCasting that say from ... to have [noise]\nI I it's just too coincidental\nOr are they read something pop in the audio that we we got we have crossed wires there for a second but you heard sweat next talking\nLet's not look at what she says I don't know trying to play the ... minute interview it's not worth it because she was just a liar I I can tell you what she's lying about\nShe's saying that she thinks that there were gang raped her she's making the allegation that there were a gang or it's going to these parties because there were boys huddled outside of rooms\nAs she ever been to a party with teenagers were drinking beer they all huddled together has she ever been to a party were teenagers are you do have a drink seven fondue whatever they're doing they clump in little groups all over the place I remember this I used to be cool I used to go to parties\nThere's nothing about what she says it makes it as a game of she claims that she was raped and ... I'll I'll put that whole that whole conversation side I Would note she hasn't named anybody that she thinks rape or\nOther than Kavanaugh who she says she thinks raped her how could you how could you sleep at night saying that somebody might have rape you when you don't know\nHow could you do that\nShe doesn't know I assume that means that she either blacked out or she claims that she was\nDrugs but then why is he bringing his name what makes her think that he was involved if she doesn't know he was involved you see what I'm saying it doesn't make any sense\nWhy is his name even coming up then because he happened to be at this party but I don't believe she ever even saw him at these parties I think this whole thing is a complete an author I Know this is a fabrication now\nDoes she pepper and some details here they're about ... she's from the area did she go to a party at some point I mean she can claim that some of this stuff might be but it's true in Vegas and certainly not true in a criminal sense she went from saying in this interview\nThat Kavanaugh spike the punch which how would that work\nHe spikes the punch everyone's drinking from that okay\nSo he wants to get the girls drunk she sang right so you can take advantage of lemons but that means everybody's getting really drunk or high school kids it's not like the guys can be drinking this up you know is adding a little added a little boost to make it a little stiffer\nOkay they're drinking punch so they can do that he can't route the the big\nBowl of punch because that means you'd be roofing himself and all the other guys and girls and everybody right it'd be like poisoning the only water source do you have well if you have to drink from that too it's a bad idea so her story is\nIdiotic doesn't make any sense\nThat that's why that's why when you get into the details at least doctor former smart to say I don't remember I don't remember all I Know is that he did this she doesn't really remember anything other than Brett Kavanaugh did this that's all she remembers this woman tried to do all this other stuff but the story was too complicated it's you can't keep it straight\nI think that they would show up wearing their high school uniform they're Catholic school uniform to these parties no no they ...\nI went to a a Catholic school or private school in Manhattan we used to parties and parents were gone and we drink beer and not really kegs but you know we'd get into all kinds of booze people weren't showing up wearing their uniforms that's just weird and she added that detail to make it seem authentic but that's that's wrong that doesn't ring true\nAnother detail that came up in the course of this never mind the fact that as I as I've already said she's changed things from her sworn statement\nShe is telling details are telling us details that don't make sense she's saying that Brett Kavanaugh maybe kinda she's not sure raped her which is not something that a person who really believe they were raped by this person would ever say\nShe also graduated a few years ahead of capital she's in her twenties and she's going to parties uh Fifteen or sixteen year old high school parties no no I'm not saying it never happens but people in college don't go to the the high school parties with sophomores in high school that doesn't happen\nI was in college not long ago that would be considered strange\nAnd she's the adult these are high school can I can tell you this when I was in college I Know that every female that I was friends with that my college if they were at a party of high school kids and they thought the girls are being roof eat and raped gang raped\nThe call the police right away right away you got to remember there's a power dynamic here right a a twenty two year old has a lot more maturity and\nWe'd be in a much stronger position to take action or would futile much stronger position socially when they're part of you know Fifteen and sixteen year olds\nI coached high school soccer I was twenty two and my kids were Fifteen or sixteen and they thought you know I was the adult and they were a bunch of kids I was going out doing keg stands with them this is the point is it doesn't make sense she's lying in an interview she gave was obvious it was a disaster\nAnyone still believes this really turned into an intelligence test because you can't J. O. know emotionally on really connected to her no she's a liar so if you're not smart enough to figure that out I don't know what to say\nTwo thoughts on this number we got we got so much more to the Senate Democrats are they're scrambling to keep this whole thing a lot because they know they know now they've mortgage all their credibility all their decency the acted like total gum to try to stop gap and all they know this\nI Wonder if they don't manage to stop him and they look like even bigger clowns in the process\nNow they've expose themselves but it's still early we've got a few days left who knows what they've got up their sleeves when you have no dignity or under protect you gotta lotta options that's what the Democrats a lot of options\nThat male facility remains under quarantine and there is still no word yet if all three letters are connected in what they are being examined by FBI forensic teams boxers\nTrace Gallagher President Trump defending his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during a campaign rally tonight in Mississippi blaming Democrats for holding up his confirmation\nGuilty until proven and it's just that's very dangerous drunk\nDriving laws confirmation vote to use expected shortly after the completion of young investigation into sexual misconduct accusations\nFox News we report you saw it [noise]\n\n[noise]\nTraffic on the Patriot am eleven\nFifty [noise] they'll have a lot of delays for the east town one thirty for getting for ... all the way to the to tens due to a wreck on the east to tend to lake Catholic sponsored by ... valley nursery\nLunar valley nurseries the largest box tree grower in America is now offering up to Fifteen Percent off on all orders this includes reflecting on all specimen size three best warranty in the industry and a free design consultations moved deli grows at\nPresent we should help you do insurance stuff\nOut your budget Boston\nWill tell us when you want to pay for insurance and hope you find out something\nGoing to get you down down down down down and I I hear your budget oh\nWait designs implanted for sale details visit moon valley nurseries dot com you're listening to the Patriot andme eleven fifty\nThis report is Roger you by super woman's super lawyer dot com\nLovely the sixties tonight with a few clouds [noise] there's a chance of rain tomorrow with temperatures in the seventies [noise]\nHi I'm personally injury attorney ... if you're injured from an accident don't call your insurance company alone I Am that up with our life let me find them for you\nI'm Amy Arabs founder of Madison read I hear color company I'm named after my daughter gets very meaningful to me when I hear your customers talked about how to read on hair color has changed their lives for years they one of our very\nFirst customers hollering my own hair is easier than I ever imagine the best part I no longer had to sit in a salon and pay over a hundred dollars to have this done now I ... when it's convenient for me\nAnd it takes less than an hour people complement me on how great my collar is in my hair is incredibly\nIn healthy living experience beautiful multi dimensional ammonia free salon polity color for under twenty five dollar joined the hundreds of thousands of women who have tried and loved Madison Reid find your perfect shape at Madison dash\nTechnology truth both you know both teenagers can communicate entirely ...\nHow ... a birthday party pizza slice kitten soccer ball pineapple\nTruth it's so easy to switch and save on car insurance I gotta go dot com\nWhy are you talking about\nFree dot com and get ten percent off plus free shipping on your first caller used code Trump that's code try try it love it that's the beauty of Madison read [noise]\nEver find yourself missing your favorite T.

Fox News President Trump better ballet in Mississippi mocking the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford the when they using Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were in high school\nHome I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many I don't want to\n\nAt least two other women accused Kavanaugh sexual misconduct allegations he strongly denies this is the FBI continued its investigation into cabin I had a plan confirmation vote a vote on\nI didn't want to make this worse did show acrimonious it's so nasty people are so upset about it we we we should do better we should come together as a country in the spirit of bipartisanship Jeff Flake may vote against cabinet that's what I think could happen here\nThat's what he would say\nIt would of course be a cave it would be a concession it would be Kavanaugh taking a rather flake taking a position on cabin all that's all about self interest and we'll talk more about this show I Do worry that after all said and done\nAny reasonable person would look at this extension and the additional facts that have come out in the news but I Know they're talking to mark judge now the FBI is going to go interview market marketed telling exactly what he's already written down and just warn statement\nI don't know this woman I don't know what you're talking about this didn't happen cabinet never did this she's like basically\nThat's what you can say about Ford maybe afford Ramirez and sweat Nick ... is the one who says that maybe maybe he Kavanaugh exposed himself during college she can't be sure but she called a lot of people to ask them what they think\nThat's not that's not something that\nConfidence in her telling of events is it\nCan't be sure exactly but you know it might have been him so let's try to pile on and help ruined his life that's where mirrors\nAnd then they find some room mate or doesn't like look you could find people in college didn't like me to they were losers they were jerks but there were some of them you know they'd probably say oh yeah a buck was you know he was bad so whatever the trash me if I were running for office of any one of you went to college is they could find somebody especially in a really politically contentious time if you're conservative everywhere\nIt loves to bash on conservatives oh gosh makes you the hero of a lot of cocktail parties really does\n\nBut I think that you might see flake vote no regardless of how that shakes out and so then it comes down to Collins and Murkowski\nCollins and Murkowski Murkowski no votes I think Collins realizes that she's done in the Senate if she votes now she's done that's my impression that's my analysis I could be wrong\nMurkowski though strikes me is more\nTransactional rent or Murkowski is a little more whatever's good for her forget about the Republican Party forget about whatever principle she's a spouse in the past\nSo\nThat's that's part of my concerns and then you also have this is continuing narrative in this ties into what I think is they're trying to build an escape hatch\nFor flake you see they can't get Kevin on the rate\nThey can't convince any normal reasonable person the cabinet was above and gang rights or that or that there's any evidence running is because there is no evidence\n\nBut you've got to remember then there's the Mazie Hirono senator Geraldo from Hawaii there's the approach that she as which is just\nWhatever we can do to criticize this guy to take him down a peg to make him look small that's what we should do whatever we can investigate about him we should investigate IRS Mazie Hirono on the ice throwing allegations play twenty\nAnd I can't I Want to ask you about these developments we found out overnight even leave the Donald with ... cabin on through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college you feel that that is in any way just qualify for somebody to the Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is why we need in the eye of the nation because there are a lot of allegations for its really are about how it is\nSo that is very relevant and the trail of himself as actively choir boy I'm very much contradicted by his ... for example in college and some people in and and I still why we need an FBI nationwide calling for one\nFor like ... ...\nMonths what\nI Do think that there's a strong case to be made that senator who wrote it was the dumbest woman or man in the Senate I think she's the dumbest human being in the Senate that's a very that seems to me to be a strong case right now the evidence for that is clear\n\nWe need an FBI investigation of capital because you might have thrown ice in someone's face during a bar fight Thirty years ago\nThirty five years ago who can say that and not feel like a moron\nReally don't don't allow yourself to assume even for a second well she's on TV she said she can't be that she can't be that silly right maybe maybe I'm being harsher no you're not being harsh on her\nTotal embezzle total and complete a missile but\nThis story about temperament and the lines of the reason that that\nTalking point is something that I Am analyze it for you there on the show\nIs because that's not going to convince anybody you you got people that hate Kavanaugh or because you know he's a white male white male privilege and you know the front row and he's a he's a conservative and overturn roe all that stuff and you can people that say no I'm actually a constitution list and also I Believe in the rule of law\nYeah that's our team\nNo one's going to change their mind about this guy based upon the alleged ice throwing into the incident of Nineteen eighty four whenever it was no that's not serious New York times during a peace right now\nOn how he was part of a\nLike party planning or something back in the day I think New York times doing that base whoa oh gosh and he was a college kid I mean they're they're adjudicating his beer drinking and\nHis social life and social habits from college when he's a fifty something year old man this is what the New York times has been reduced to a joke a disgrace times also had Emily Babylon reporting on Kavanaugh as a quote reporter when in July before any of this happened she came out and said she opposes him because of the threat that he poses to civil rights\nAnd women's rights on short too of course that's that's that's a given you can assume that\nLook by creating this storyline of temperament and oh he's a he's a belligerent drunk he was mean he's a bad guy that's not for any normal person to change their mind one way or the other that's\nAll about getting an escape hatch for flake and maybe Murkowski\nOh we don't want to let's put forward we agree by the flakes word is good for nothing I mean he could come out today and say I guarantee you I Would vote for capping off this has done and we don't have any more derogatory information I still wouldn't believe\nUntil the votes happened we don't know guys a coward an absolute wet noodle spine coward\nBut if they can open this story line you see how it goes oh we need somebody who's a more bipartisan pick this whole process has been tainted the country's two divided right now\nSo in response to the left waging an unprecedented partners in assault on cabin on all of his supporters and and all those around them in the entire system and all the women dressed in The Handmaid's tale costumes and putting anatomically correct female body parts on their heads as hats and all the stuff that they're doing\nAll that flake takes the position of\nOh well we should have now and give them what they want in the spirit of bipartisanship that's what I think's going to end up happening I think flakes going to be a no vote at the end of this whole thing knowing that yes you'll receive a lot of\nViciousness from Washington viciousness a lot of anger is not vicious it's completely warranted legitimate justice really from people but\nHe's playing the long game of I Want to get a book or a book deal from Simon and Schuster or whomever you know a big big big publishing house\nThat's that's what flakes game last year or so that's why I I'm concerned I I don't know how the votes will go\nI'm not I have zero confidence in their ability of Republicans in this case to do what's right [noise] well one thing that just that just got released and I I wasn't sure I I'm not going to read to you from it\nBecause it is salacious that you could definitely say it as it is a salacious document sort of like the salacious dot CA but it\nDid I I have noticed All right I ...

it\nHave\nTo stop them from being able to set the government agenda will be a bad thing for all of us so I don't want anyone to lose sight of that but\nThe truth is nobody really knows what's gonna

because they have been doing a good job some perfect not not\nBeyond reproach but yeah there's some very very positive things that are happening that that's one point I wanted to make here and in terms of what we've seen with Kavanaugh I Can't say what the reaction is going to be because until you see the reaction then then you\nSee the reaction you're not in a position to really assess whether it's going to have an impact on it it doesn't get through Republicans better send a message for the good of the country better send a message that\nThis will not stand this aggression dude will not stand that's what has to be said and that means preventing Democrats from taking the house\nDemocrats take the house it's going to turn into one long endless investigation and impeachment fight that's the only thing that's going to be out there that's the only thing that the Democrats are really going to focus on there's no ... no policy agenda they are going to be all agree on\nWe'll talk later about who they think they're going to run for the presidency but we're a month out from election day and I have to say this week which\nIs hopefully going to come to a close with Kavanaugh's confirmation but if it doesn't have that could be the difference maker in the midterms\nI don't believe this other side of it I think that this is wishful thinking and the Democrats than women will turn out in huge numbers of Kavanaugh gets on the Supreme Court I think the only women who really believe that Kavanaugh is a bad guy and a Kavanaugh's a you know a predator and that and that you know women should be believed all all that stuff all that clock track rhetoric that you hear\nAre the women who really take that to heart and are mobilized to vote as a result of it have

to do the easiest thing for him to do would be just to vote\nFor a cat in order to get them out of committee and that's the end of that but he held his vote ransom as it were basically saying you can have my vote but we need a week to do this FBI investigation and that took whether or not you agree with that that wasn't gutsy thing to do when it 'cause it made every Republican in the Senate mad at him\nIs the most overrated thinker in the news business I Would wager he's entirely wrong here with his analysis on\nThese Stephen Colbert show that's absolutely wrong it is the opposite what Jeff Flake did the flake out as it were is the opposite of courage because flake had already said earlier that day that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nThe reason he did not was that he could not take the heat that's\nNot courage that is actually the opposite of courage that is called cowardice but notice how this spring and\nThey're trying to you and this is very all tapper very stylish Mitt news media they want all the little senators that are still in the mix they want everybody who is perhaps persuadable on this one when you get to the final vote process\nThey want everyone to know that you

going to be concern with first and foremost\nLike didn't show courage not the harder thing to do he knows this is a scam he's not a complete moron and he knows\nThat if he were to have gone along and do the right thing he would be in for men this hot water right now with the last with the media so what did he do try to create an alibi for himself\nI'm Still not convinced that he will vote for Kavanaugh but I Would note that even if he does vote for Kavanaugh flake thinks that he's going to be the Republican in this process who when he wants to give fancy speeches in Aspen\nOr East Hampton or wherever when he wants to be among the lead again and treated like somebody that they can stand from the right you know they can kind of accept him\nHe will say oh well I was the one that got the one week extension I was the one that made sure that there was a step beyond ... investigation which as we now she is a sham it was always going to be a sham inflate knew it was a chef\nSo what's it like do why did he do it self interest which is the opposite of courage\nCowardice because he felt like he had been cornered by those women including a straw roast funded active if you can't even make this stuff up\nYelled at him and so he decided to make a different call that day and what he had already said in the morning same day\nLike is a self interest in power in this whole process and that

large American markets but just cars and light trucks\nOr believe some questions about steel tariffs I mean this is\nA big say a big deal is is a big victory\nAny other administration pull this off folks anyone else\nManaged to do this and the response would be oh my gosh wow you mean it only took somebody about Twenty years to come around and say hold on a second we need to renegotiate this deal which NAFTA from Nineteen Ninety Nineteen Ninety five I think maybe Ninety four\nDidn't really have the Internet to deal with the time a tremendous amount of change with regard to trade and how industry a is done and what people are buying what the consumer markets are\nEach time for this deal to get updated that's what's really happened here the president managed to pull it off anyone else will be there should be considered a victory but it's Trump is Trump and so the response is always oh well it's not you know it's it's not good enough oh he he didn't he didn't\nReally manage something that's as good as you are being told that is\nOf course told that his by people like me and a bunch of others but not the mainstream media not the overwhelming number of media outlets out there they're so invested in telling you that Trump is a bumbling the food that he can't do anything right that he's terrible in negotiation that he has no idea what he's doing this is what they'll tell you\nI'm this doesn't square with the reality though and you know I'm I'm Out here in this this conference which stands for research some of you know them 'cause I Do a podcast with their with their founder and chairman and stands where it's a it's a great group\nI I've learned a lot about investing and finance firm I really enjoy working with them but they bring out all these experts experts on trade and crypto currency and investing and all kinds of things are just a whole slew of its three days of a world class experts in speakers I brought my buddy Sean Parnell out this year who are\nShown that a great job or if you ever get a chance to er here Shawn tell the first major enemy contract he had an Afghanistan maybe you'll have him come on and tell us that story as kind of fun I'll I'll sit back with all you and just relax kick off my feet on the desk milk oh Sean Scott story time for us but I'm speaking\nTo all these different people who are\nVery involved in the markets the economy and they have to be right now that's one thing you get a lot of these people go on TV on I'm On a ... style of a card for the number is oh this is what Paul Krugman says\nI'm Talking about people that have to be right because of where they're putting their money where they're investing what they're doing and even the ones that were very skeptical a Trump and there's a lot of Trump skeptics out here that I'm Talking to\nYou ... you can't disregard the results and that's what people want to do I'm not even saying you\nYou're not allowed to argue that the results aren't as good as people say fine you know people want to quibble over how good the results have been that's one thing but you can't just regard them you can't say oh the economy is amazing but it's not Trump that did this or Trump doesn't get any credit for this that's just that's being unreasonable\nThat's not looking at the evidence and making decisions based on what's well making coming to conclusions based on what's really happening here\nThere and there's some other stuff and I always been set about Trump in the last day or so you had a a union leader or union leader no less thanking Trump for tax breaks play Thirteen\nThanks to Mr Trump than the tax rate farms and then\nA general confidence in the economy I guess we have really been able to invest more in our employees and grow our company and the last year were investing more in in play wages\nAnd benefits and bonuses are spending millions on equipment and assets and\nIn general are just seeing a huge increase in the work they're coming out because utilities are spending more to update\nThe aging infrastructure so thank you very much made a huge impact [noise] they are\nLooking to grow about twenty or thirty percent more employees and the next few months we had a lot of large projects that are starting and then this will make I think a big difference and really the incentive that aren't good for businesses are really important for our employees also the community as we work and and we've\nReally been thankful and has the ... President Trump has been in office\nSo that's a union leader telling you what the tax break has meant for the union that she represents for the employees that people showing up trying to earn a living trying to pay their mortgage feed their families and all this positive stuff she saying you're you're getting the message elsewhere\nIt's not rocket science folks if you have more money if your business has to give less of the money that it makes if you have to have less of your property taken from you by the government venue or in a better position\nTo invest to pay people more to grow to compete this is\nIt just so straightforward isn't it Democrats come up with all these convoluted theories about oh no we need a higher tax or why should we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world why does that make sense someone explained that to me because we get the best government services for our business is that's a laugh\nAnd it's not even just the tax breaks that have resulted in so many\nBenefits and and so much good stuff going on or there's also the regulatory environment change which I I ... I'm ... I'm speaking I'm gonna place more ... more a\nAnother soundbite here for you from a small business owner of the Trump rally but I'm Talking to a small business owners just for for days I'm Out here in Vegas for three days\n... Los ... I'm Out here for three days and I'm Talking to all these different people from industry and and corporate America and even the ones you don't like Trump style or don't align with them or\nAll of his policies they're saying what he's doing is working what Obama was doing before was bad\nIt makes it harder for businesses when you think that growing massive government programs spending more money on entitlements a trillion dollar stimulus give away a left wing interest when you think that's the most productive ways to use capital you're wrong bad things happen when you let the business of the American people will be business Jabbar from Calvin Coolidge\nGood things can happen and that also means de\nRegulating and here's one of the speed you or not he at the small business rally the Trump pattern at the rally he's a small business owner play forging\nFirst I'd like to uh think President Trump for helping us with his fiscal policy which have enabled my company Arcadia electric to bid on more work\nAnd uh take on more jobs um that were able to do now because we have more coming um that's available to us a more than ever before and\nAs a result of that um we have been able to keep our a hundred and twenty people employed but next year we anticipate higher in twenty five percent\nMore a hard working union workers middle class um workforce tank or the president of the United states for his perseverance and for us to get this work\nAnd to change the regulatory policies that he's been doing that he spoke of earlier this was all health food to us so President Trump\nNineteen\n... what is the what is the counterpoint to this really we're going to hear in a few minutes we'll talk about how it was about the war\nAnd like I said it's your neck injury around\nMy war and in my Hillary impression and very similar because I find them very similar even though they're I guess pretty different\nBut we need to turn the country around you said earlier that we've got that sound for you sure on how to make it worse make us more poor turnaround this\nWealth creation turned around the investment in the job creation that that's what Richard ... this is what you get from left or even when things were going well even things that they hate things that work if it is ideologically not working because of what they said ... if it goes against their ideology\nThat it doesn't matter that it's bringing all kinds of benefits to people and doing all sorts of good stuff so I I got to say I'm hearing it from the horse's mouth so to speak lots of business owners lots of investment professionals and they're saying is Trump economies the real deal we should remember that go into the midterms\n\nIt's an honor and privilege of bringing my thoughts on the things that matter to us as

catastrophic implosion between now and then\nShe has in my mind no jets and I mean no chance\nOf defeating Donald Trump just doesn't have it doesn't have the skills and I think that she's also\nAlready really been marginalized by building a career\nBased on racial fraud that's what you did\nThe she became a senator because she was a Harvard law professor she became a Harvard law professor because\nShe claimed that she was a Native American on an application there now I Would say that I'm actually in favor of doing that meaning I'm In favor of using the system in that way but only to bring the system crumbling down and to be open and honest about it and say oh no I Know I'm not Native American but I claimed it I think I'm a\nI think I'm about two percent according to my brother's ancestry DNA I think I'm two percent so good I claim Native American status I'm I'm not exactly sure I don't I don't know but it's worth a shot\nBut I don't think Warren speaking of a shot I don't think warns got a shot and the fact that she's even talking about this for twenty twenty just goes to show you wow Democrats have a very weak bench right now\nAlso this notion that she needs to turn the country around and I I keep returning to this notion to this point because I I have to tell you I'm I'm sitting here and I keep saying to myself\nWhat exactly is the Democrats hate so much about what's happening around us well what is really their objection again we're not starting wars in countries we don't need to be at war and we don't have some you know we don't we don't have the worst thing happened in this country right now so crazy the Democrats are but she's the truth\nThere's nothing that's going on right now that you say to yourself oh my gosh if this doesn't stop I don't know what's gonna happen I don't know what kind of shared we're going to be a no that's\nThat's not reality reality is that overall the country is doing quite well over all the country is on a very solid trajectory and you could say it's destroyed the strongest economy certainly since the year two thousand so it almost twenty or some people just wrong as economy more like forty or fifty years\nReally strong account\nSo I I have to ask what does she think needs to be turned around exactly the Trump tweets out mean things what what part of what she's saying here is based in reality versus what part of this is just demagoguery ... the usual stuff would expect from what\nI did it twice twice when\nShe has no charisma no charm nothing\nAnd men people are going to get really testy with all of\nThe mockery that's going to come her way for claiming that ... you know she's not\nI Would look there's nothing there's no I'm not trying to say that being a school's not a good thing but she didn't have the academic pedigree to become a Harvard professor without it it's not like it was a close call unless you went to an Ivy League law school and then she wanted to be a professor at Harvard Jewish state school in New Jersey not a particularly\nYou know selective state school again not going to be a jerk\nBut she used because you can get a great education folks at any of these schools now really it's all up it's all up you it's all based on whether you do the work\nI guess that's a that's a conversation we can get into you know another time but yeah I really do look at this now and and try to get a sense as to whether Warren's going to run and twenty twenty and I hope she does men Trump will have a field day with her and it also means that Trump is a shoe in in my

Wondering what's going on and\nAnd ah so I made my determinations or Jones keeping me and he said hey just tell me what this final blows give me what do you think it is then I said it's going to be a biological attack on the United states\nMeals I agree I agree that um and uh I think I'm going on the show again soon probably this will be a good follow up for that job when you're talking about this uh\nBut yeah I told him that I felt it would be a biological attack on the United states I speculate on many different occasions that this will be carried out because I started off talking about quite acts in may I talked about the the tabletop exercise of a pandemic\nSo they're they're preparing for some biological attack some\nContamination some toxic release um I talked to a geena function exercise is something that most people don't know about it and bring it to the forefront of talked about how sometimes in order to do with ... they take a less virulent form of something that he released into the public\nIs test to see you know how people react to it\nSometimes they provide them with the antidote sometimes they see how many people checking hospital how many people stay home how many people bring it to work that you know it's just the way for the CDC and others to to to monitor the movie the disease and some people don't support this and a lot of people say it's not good to do this but they do it anyway\nUm\nApparently there's new TV show\nAbout doctors called New Amsterdam\nOr apparently that was a that's a show that's on TV Now and somebody had said that it deals with a guy who gets at Bola Andy brings it to the United states on a plane\nAnd of course we talked about the arrow plague we talked about you know the situation that happened or would be a Emirates blamed for other planes\nWhere uh you know there was a different diseases monkey pox and uh gosh all kinds of things are happening and it's all happening at once and they said this is a is a gain of these again are forced to exercise\n\nAnd uh I said you know something is going to happen where are the real thing is going to go down and when it does you know we'll know that this the beginning\nThe beginning of the final blow them\nAnd so I actually well and it could have been ... through the ... it could be you know give them through mosquitoes and so today I read that the Pentagon reporter that envelope containing biological poison rice and arrived at the Pentagon\nOr the office of the president and senator Senator Ted Cruz's campaign office\nSo two packages containing rice and\nIs intercepted by on the way to the Pentagon and the existence of the suspected packages was had been confirmed by the department of defense officials who indicated the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged in the mail delivery building on Monday\nBut in announcer they were here until Tuesday that was located next door to the defense department and right there it's at its headquarters the FBI has been called in now\nTo lead the investigation into the packages which we're addressing the secretary of defense James Mattis out that there was an address to James mad as chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson and the president said Cruz's operas they're released this statement\nThis was a statement from the FBI on Tuesday October second twenty gene in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents took possession of too suspicious envelopes that had been screened at the Pentagon mail facility\nHe's envelopes are currently undergoing further testing and this is ongoing will have no further comment on this\nSo as Washington DC has been working to figure out of this you know this was any threat to the president Ted Cruz's office said they received a piece of mail it was addressed the Senator Cruz happened this morning when the male is open again Jane White powder\nAnd so the night for the Phoenix tower was evacuated up the packages found Pentagon also reports that rice and was detected and that uh and and so\nWe're having a full on biological attack biological a poison rice and and they'll just reminded me if you remember when I was talking about the project for the new American Century I said something to the fact\nThat ah one of the other ways that they can change the direction of anything politically is to use biological warfare and even biological warfare that has a certain abilities to mark\nAre you a biological markers that would do would actually activate this stuff and and and rice and acts upon your DNA if ingested or if it's injected\nIf you inhale it and so you can survive a inhaling a rice and it's just that you can die if you're not taking care of\nSo uh it's just some uh pretty scary stuff going on right now and so you know timing is everything and uh I think that uh once again we're seeing history repeating itself because remember back in Nineteen eighty four the\nRussian each call here in Oregon\nTried to poison the group of people to try and change the vote\nOr in Dallas, Oregon and ah I think here we're seeing a somebody trying to either stop the investigation into cabinet or to believe that the investigation into Kavanaugh or what they're doing is they're trying to find a way\nTo a distract us from it\nAh there's there's a number of things you know especially going down during this time is that I think is volatile time in this country and ah I said the other night on the ground zero lounge they probably will have this investigation wrapped up by Wednesday\nThey'll hand down their decision in the American people probably won't hear what the decision it and they don't have to be FBI doesn't have to reveal anything about their investigation they could put it to a vote and Kevin okay to be confirmed and I think it would trigger a lot of anger\nWith a lot of people in this country if Kavanaugh actually becomes chief

and the people freak out those who are all you know invested in this those who are like ... people like Mitch McConnell in others those are invested this we need to be careful because you're anything can happen at this point\nIn with rice and being a delivered to you know the Pentagon some address to the president I don't understand why\nThis is not being investigated and and uh people are wondering if this was an attempt to assassinate the president\nOr in a in a more broader sense that'd be ... should exercise because if they could send you all of the uh the people involved with the cabinet for case you know packages of rice in ... they could have killed at every single one of them or make them picking up or too sick to vote and they said before\nSo this is something that the

nice diversion drinking beer with you but this is it's like okay great but uh\nNo they have a couple of different thoughts um I Do I like how you are you always see these patterns and it is interesting where it before that that called the more that the touch tomorrow [noise]\nUm the the thing I keep thinking is is a couple of things is you know is it possible that it is possible but is it possible that\nThis could also be a distraction or I use that word by word but\nCould it be that actually\nThe light side the right way so to speak or could be putting this on as a distraction or whatever I'm too you know get some sympathy or whatever and then the other thing would be is um it's kind of interesting that the targeting of course Donald Trump you know he's the head of the right\nAnd then you have said Cruz which if you Peru's Facebook\nYou know everybody seems to eat a Ted Cruz even though he's not really\nIn the fall it anymore and the other interesting thing is is that Ted Cruz at one point wasn't he kind of a a guy that would have been considered to be a good a Supreme Court nomination so\nWell I don't know forgetting to bench a secretary of defense James Mattis was targeting also chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson was it was also targeted\n[noise] sure yeah I don't I don't know where their political affiliations ... but\nBut see that's the thing is that if this was I mean obviously this is politically motivated\nOr we don't know do that for what reason it was politically motivated I Would say it was to thwart the investigation and the vote the confirmation vote\nI think that it would give them a reason and we're going to stop this right now\nAnd we're going to investigate who was involved with sending the rice and but it's not going to stop the FBI the FBI is already made the decision and and I know they've already made the decision because um you know uh actually we were to ground zero allows discussing this and somebody said to me they said well\nThey're going wrap this up by Wednesday they don't have to wait till friday they said well a week's time they don't have to wait all they have to do\nIs go back over ...

on people who don't like the idea get angry and he started harassing people even more and maybe even worse than that\nAbsolutely and and the other thing is is it's just um it it's it's interesting

story that nice story that was going on in in the summer of two thousand one right before nine eleven and a matter of fact that morning at nine eleven before the fight our\nHead hunter reporter stayed outside and look at senator named ... ... and the investigation under this is Shawn Levy remember that\nYeah I remember that it it after the plane hit the tower\nAnd they lost like getting a function they your but after the plane that story was that was gone like you didn't hear about\nThe about all I Love yeah I mean but she she disappeared in May of two thousand one right and uh yeah I mean that was the the hot news item until the the towers went down and then that everyone was like but after that you know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nI'm thinking this is comparable with the capping off for [laughter]\nI I yeah I but Gary wasn't planning on a or B being achieved justice [laughter] ... yeah I mean once again we have an extramarital affair story we have\nA a dead woman Chandra Levy a we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about it because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know these ... that that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a back but uh I Would say that you know they're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course\nI'm sure many people lost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case with Gary Condit that is if they were able to look through the dust cloud nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I got out there and she gets another good very good point do very good comparison history you get your brownie points for being in storage off but I think it ... and I love it if you've been I Love you too man skilled at TJ in Rhode Island I don't either I\nMight I might be quick as much as I can be bought you obviously ... what does two plus one plus eight at up to\nTwo plus one plus eight yep eleven\nThat's right and what does two plus there are a plus one plus eight add up to\nUm eleven\nOh that's right and when was ... what was what was that date back in September\nAnd then I and I ... when I was\nOne plus one add up to\nNine plus one plus one yep twelve\nNine oh what a loving sorry that's right\nAlthough nine eleven had the total eleven twenty Eighteen eleven you have this thing going on at two Eighteen as you said right\nWhich is an eleven alive and yeah and we just had a jogger who was murdered in DC not too long ago\n... to what was discussed just recently by the previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an area quality to it and\n... you want if you want to get technical when was the ground broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what was that September eleventh\nAll right yeah I Would say just one thing but I was calling up about the rice said and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side because\nIf you recall back in terms of predicting programming\nWhat happened to them Adderall in Venezuela where they accused him of staging his little assassination attempt with that drone ... might have tip their hand right they're letting you know in advance what was coming\nWhile I mean you can see that there was something going on with these ah when I called these gain and function exercise I Believe the Emirates plane was part of that\nI Believe that when you have a group of people on the on the plane and they all complain of flu like symptoms all at once that's not a flu that's something else does\nSmack of of rice in poisoning and I'll just to be cleared Nineteen forty one nine eleven September eleven Nineteen forty one was in the Pentagon round was broken for the Pentagon then so I Know nine eleven to be talked about two\nMen then remember overseas there's a lot of provocative behavior taking place upon the part of the United states where they're already threatening to\nStrike a Russian missile or install installation because of start treaty violations and they're moving a ships to the ass off to\nSee a off of the Ukrainian coastline over there and they were Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the world right\nAnd so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting the votes how are they affect you invest\nThe vote I Would tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down to that's gonna be a traumatic decision that will be the battle cry\nBecause armed yeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nYou feel do if the FBI did not release the information about cabinet and his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I wouldn't be repealed but I've also ripping based on the fact that there's this ... this a speculation on the part of Fox News that they're going to already be finished by ...\nNow you have the ads not ... I'm Sorry to tell you it's not speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when at Fox News that I heard it already from inside of that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just devalue wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell and they wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but now Mitch McConnell has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nDoesn't matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over it and now well that's what I\nTell you when you when you start playing with the very last\nWord because it's not right because that's the last word but it's ... it's the last it's ... it's the last word not because it's right but because it is the last word once you start making something from politicized the political that nobody's going to have faith and or in in the integrity of that institution anymore\nWell I think people want space Eighteen years ago you do really I Do I did and I have that's why I'm not political\nWell see that's why I don't understand your problem with people again being harassed you say by it I don't call that harassed and I think\nThat is around look if I if I get on an escalator and a woman says to me oh you turn your back on women is I treat women I look back at it and say no I'm On an escalator I'm getting away from you jumping all over me and yelling at me for something I have no control over\nBut they wouldn't be doing it to you because you're not a person who takes the position of publicity and demanding attention\nAt and then even then I had\nThis agreement because I still consider it better than a presidential candidate who says to people beat the cream cheese out of somebody and I'll pay for\nYour legal you know any excuses Trump I don't excuse Trump from what he says\nFact he causes own problems on his own but when you have people that do basically ... things about you in public and yelling out all over the place I get very angry about in fact I get mad when people assume things about me ... ... troops and the reason why they\nStand on anything and you have and I need\nI don't know why you don't have a matter of men do not have mattered and I I Do have power I have I have three hundred stations across the country to get me power\nBut in terms of being able to directly affect change or not a politician you don't have that kind of\nPower [noise] I don't know about\n... celebrity yet that but again you don't take positions on anything you you'll offer hypotheses and have your gas and your uh\nYour upper hypotheses that seem to come through now don't\nBut that's still it's still something you let people debate you don't take a stab you throw\nIt out there and we all get to talk about writing is DJ here's a thing as simple as I may be and it's maybe not as powerful as a politician I maybe I Swear to God I get accused of so many things in my article wrong and I and I said to myself how do people come up with this crap will come up with this idea that I'm Vince and Vince and Vince ... your\nPersonal throws out possibilities and say now discuss them\nWell and you know it was like people always say oh quite a show for the women look if I was in the ...
