I think that's what he owed on the car at the time they reported ...\nBack in the late ... Seventy thousand yeah what was he driving\nA suburban but I think it's absolutely outrageous [laughter]\nUh yeah any Roald some negative equity into that to get to their ... and so that the forty five thousand is the difference of good they'll settle that for pennies on the dollar probably sell that for ten grand but the rest of the stuff I don't know I mean the ex wife thing I don't know what you're going to do with that I was a world ends up on her and these two attorneys\nUm while a\nYou might be able to settle those would lump sum I mean you might walk up to her and say here's a check for thirty if you go away um and uh she might take it you know but you'd have to have the thirty thousand dollars is what I'm doing better not thirty dollars and so you know you've got to put some money together here and that means both of you are going to get your incomes up and you both\nBye bye I desire to get out of money or to get out of debt and to make more money to do that you have to both have this thing and it's still going to take you a few years I mean if you guys just go bananas it's going to take you a few years so um\nThat that's what you're facing and um but the the thing is folks I hear those will be dating out there it is not a deal breaker as far as I'm concerned it can be for you you decide what you want to do with your life but I don't tell people to not to get married over that\nI Do tell them to not to get married over the decision to stay in that when you don't want to say that because that's going to be when you can't be in agreement on money before you get married when money is the number one cause of divorce we can highly predict that your marriage is not gonna last\nIt's it's ... it's okay if the number one cause of divorce you don't agree on\nGuess what you're going to get divorced I mean that's just as a fairly simple\nEquation here and so you have to be in agreement so I don't the two fifty doesn't scare me it scares me but it doesn't terrify me to say this guy's not keeper I don't know if he's a keeper not I can't tell he sure has a bad taste and lawyers and all that but because he got his way up\nBut um anyway [noise]\nMan he ends up paying her lawyer his lawyer owes her Seventy grand and half of his income\nOff a lot of four that's a good gosh so uh wow yeah\nSomebody so anyway yeah ... this was not\nAn equitable outcome I have no idea what the situation was but wow what a mess\nAnyway so the all of that behind us now the question is are we committed to cleaning it up if we are then ready to go gay

only to okay [laughter]\nI Know and with that we have about Fifteen thousand extra um savings on top of our six month emergency fund so the question is a story about forty on the house is worth about a hundred mhm um and it's an a good rental area so our goal is to move in about two to four years\nAnd with that fourteen or Fifteen extra grand do we use that to start paying off the mortgage more right now I Do double payments so we're already actively trying to pay that off quicker but do we [noise]\nWe commit to paying off house early or do we split it and keep keep doing the uh the paying

don't think they're doing anything to course in the discourse they don't think that they bear any of the responsibility for this Hillary Clinton is the most shameless self advancing person you could find anywhere why do you think she's saying give us power meaning the Democrats\nOr we will be on civil\nBecause she has taken the temperature of a Democrat left and she realizes that is where they are right now it's you better let us have power back you better give us authority over all of you or we will find other ways non political ways\nTo ban YouTube or will this leads down a very dark path

yelling dishes for health care and how many of you who even heard that until now they are playing dirty you\nKnow that the media is doing everything they can to make it seem like either this is not a problem or the other favorite tactic you either downplayed which they of course do\nOr the other side of it is it's on both sides and he's not on both sides there are not conservatives cornering Democrat politicians threatening them yelling at them\nAnd they're certainly aren't conservative commentators news anchors prominent politicians who are saying yeah that's okay\nSenator Hirono the dumbest person in the Senate I think maybe only\nSecond to hide cap I I don't know it's it's a close call right now but\nI think probably the dumbest person in the Senate we could argue about that ... says you know this is just what people do when they're angry and you see this reflected on the different networks I I didn't want to talk about this yesterday but\nI Can't find a way around it because the mob mentality of the left is on display we are finding out who they really are and they don't like at the American people are seeing it and recognizing it\nAnd that's why they want to play word games now like this incident\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word out totally a mop it is without a doubt that there's no other we're now\nIt's a little put a stop on on on what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August ... it's not what we saw chasing right\nWhat about the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that civil protest or cut them up I think it's easily him off\nYeah and if it were the party or as we call it um out for sure come on let's be serious\nWomen now let me let me let me move past the N. word because I Do feel like that is part of new relation of of what's happening now on the right\nWhat's happening is people are seeing this what's happening is that the mainstream media ... another M ward is losing control of the narrative and they don't know what to do because they can't make these looted chick\nDavis on Capitol Hill disappear they can't take away all these soundbites of politicians of prominent members of the left wing media saying you know if you've got to go to people's faces and scream at them go for it\nOh for example Eric Holder\nMay have used the powers that may have gotten [noise] for for the wrong thing they want to keep themselves in that they want to cheat or juice [laughter] vegetables in it is time for us as Democrats [noise] to be as tough as they are\nTo be as dedicated as they are to be committed is\nMichele always this is all over [laughter] my wife like really tight [laughter] while you're here [laughter]\nI was always says you know ...\n[laughter]\nThey go low we [noise]\n\nYou know that's a pretty accurate description of where the Democrat Party is right now they kick us they're okay with that\nAnd we don't have to go low but going alone now means demanding due process\nGoing lo means that presumption of innocence to Democrats going lo means not sitting there complacent Lee while yes a mob of lunatics senators and with actual mobs outside\nDecides ... are you in front of your wife your shoulder in the entire American viewing population\nBy claiming that you are a secret gang rape is from your teenage years and nobody figured it out and chill right before you're going to be Supreme Court nominee only idiots can't believe this\nOr people who have been brainwashed people who have been so thoroughly propaganda sized too that\nThey can't find any weight or reason through these things\nThey really think that Trump is a threat to the republic they're really think that Republicans want to uh set up concentration camps on the border for people that aren't from this country but these this is the kind of rhetoric that they keep using and we say OK okay this must be\nVicious must just be the Democrats trying to fire up the base trying to get people enthusiastic about politics on their side\nMaybe we really just need to take them at their word maybe they actually do believe this stuff or at least enough of them believe it that the party has taken a turn from just being wrong on issues to being dangerous\nOne thing to say the Democrats\nAre ignorant of history and refused to\nAdmit or allow evidence contrary to their closely held belief is another thing to say that\nYou can't even have a conversation with them any more about this they're living in an alternate reality and they're aggressive and they're angry and they are being encouraged by their most prominent members to take this out on you I I've\nBeen asked the question is I said what do you do when someone says oh you're a Republican you must be a Nazi the answer is not oh try to convince them you're not lost the answers get away from them\nWe are now entering a phase in political discourse where for reasons of self preservation and safety I Would tell you\nDon't engage with these people don't don't talk to them and you could you just don't know you just don't know it's definitely going to be ugly or going to say terrible things do you can handle the harsh words I Know but\nIt's a very small margin of error between someone getting up in your face because they don't like your politics and screaming at you in front of your wife or your husband or whomever\nAnd all of a sudden a scuffle breaks out and now there's real violence and not only has to happen once before then the temperature gets raised even more and now the next time people square off in some kind of a public dispute over politics\nThe impulse to become violent is even more apparent right the impulse to take this to a level of\nHitting people attacking kicking people and perhaps even worse do not forget that the Democrats\nPushed the lives of the black lives matter movement and there were many many lives I heard them I can tell you what they are among them that there was an epidemic of killing of young black men by racist cops who have their or for whom there's no accountability that's ally\nOut but among among the many lives that were told to this day as well\nIt didn't lead to any violence that the anti corporate or did not lead to violence alert there five dead officers from Dallas tactic in Texas a who clearly their families their departments their friends would disagree with that notion very strongly\nAs well as ... instances of other violence against cops cross gotta chew killed sitting at a patrol car here in New York City where I'm currently doing this show\nLeft wing rhetoric has led to violence including lethal violence where's the correlate we we hear so much that she and I think are talking about Charlottesville and we will continue to hear about a casualty at Charlottesville\nWhenever this conversation about political violence but yet they are so slow to bring up the many many more casualties that have been caused by political rhetoric from the other side\nBecause ultimately they can't win these arguments that they're having with us their arguments are not prevailing in the quarter phobic opinion their arguments about cabin or did not prevail\nAnd they are frustrated they are angry and when people become frustrated and angry but also think that they are righteous in that anger they can become dangerous\nTake senator Paul's warning to heart if this town does not change if there is not a willingness among those and media say mob violence mob destruction mob threats are bad a group of people\nMenacing and individual or a couple of individuals because their politics is wrong this is not who we are and show they're willing to do that this will continue to get worse I

of the worst storm to hit that side of Florida heading to Georgia right now uh the devastation though is that the the footage and the video this is is horrific\nJust feels like this came I Know that they had a couple of days when it feels like a storm came into neural have all producer Mike\nPull some more information on this and I certainly hope everyone everyone got out of code and anybody who still left in the path of this thing hunker down safe and is able to able to ... wait it out but obviously if you're told to go\nGo to tend to Georgia right now\nAre back to our our political discussion though\nThe\nParsing of language is always a tell from the west\nWhether we're talking about immigration when they use terms like oh on documented immigrant they'll talk about an undocumented ... why can't we just say illegal alien that's the legal term why do you insist on trying to change the words that we use year out of out of course change dumped two words that have some\nPolitical political connotation right that that automatically skew the debate one side of the other but it is a new thing to have people claim that a group\nOf those who are trying to destroy property or or or threatening people and acting in a way that is that his menacing and that is dangerous it cannot be referred to as a mob if it's because they like really really don't like having a like then it's a different thing\nI I didn't know that we would get to this place as quickly as ... but but sure enough here we are where we can't even agree any more on what on what a mob is\nWe can't agree anymore that civility is even a baseline for political discourse that there's there's no need anymore to expect\nThat one side will be civil to the other because it's really just all about when it all cost Democrats take these as the lessons from their losses the worst possible lessons\nInstead of saying maybe we should stop\nBeing a party that's driven by the agenda of you know Nancy Pelosi Planned Parenthood and code bank maybe\nWe should try to appeal to Americans and do things that would actually benefit this country instead of constantly finding ways to divide\nAnd make things more acrimonious more typical\nNastier and as I say more dangerous\nBut I I Want to tackle this question with the momentarily what is a mob and why does the left has such a problem with calling a mob what it is that's coming up [noise]\n[noise]\nHurricane Michael blame for at least one Destin, Florida the storm toppling a tree in the home of a green borough ma'am scores of homes and businesses damaged or destroyed and flooding has been widespread Florida attorney general Pam Bondi urging residents to stay sheltered until official say otherwise there's\nWater everywhere they're downed power

News [noise]\n\nHe's holding the line for America bug sex is that [noise]\nI'm waiting for liberal and you know intellectually honest liberals to admit that when you were rats headquarters is in a restaurant that is also mop like behavior why is it that I'm willing to concede that Donald Trump is a bad person and that that's my behavior but I never hear liberals come on or ...\nI don't want to say that that kind of behavior following senators or any other like that official into a restaurant and now with our family I don't agree on that I didn't I I\nI don't like I I Know you've got that show\nThat I don't know why we're or\nWhen you stop okay I've got to get to the break we'll answer your question did us or is it my behavior no it's not my right to people who are on it and they're not the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy of either we know lives matter\nBefore you jump in okay\nHe just supposed to sit there you see and get pummeled he's a he's a never\nTrump conservative for never Trump Republican or whatever\nAnd his job he the guy I Know because they they wanted me to play the role and I wouldn't blame his job is just sit there and just get smacked around by I think there were four lives on that CNN\nPale including the host for lives\nAnd one due to that ... that\nHe's totally correct I mean I I give him credit for at least you want to say I don't see it but they act like it's now it's a question of the number one might be ... what do you mean it's a mob when you've got a big Bassem when you've got more than three people\nWho are together screaming in your face and acting like maniacs because they're trying to have dinner with your wife 'cause they don't like your politics don't like her political party that's getting in the ... when you get twenty or thirty or forty people that are doing it which is what we've seen in these restaurants at a minimum\nThen it's definitely my behavior but that that is the word used to describe it but you see there are very sensitive about using that\nWere there very sensitive about saying it because they know that their audience is all a bunch of lives\nAnd they don't want the lives to feel like an even sending me about the really devoted lives you know there there's a sympathy\nJust because people don't go out and you know where all the black stuff and act like anti\n... doesn't mean that\nThey despise Andy fun fact I think there are way more Democrat and you're seeing this now\nWho\nDon't necessarily agree with that he was methods but they agree with the message and they know\nThat the audience the CNN audience does not want to be told\nYeah I I got to say I I don't know\nHow it is that that segment on CNN is considered up to ... in any way up to that network standards that that's acceptable I how how ... how it is allowed to happen\nOn a cable news show when when keep in mind there's a guy who I interviewed a what was it maybe a few weeks ago who's a sports\nA cast her and she said something about about boobs on he said that he you know I forget what it was exactly but he made some reference to the female organ that is called by some uh boobs and\nIt was a big like oh my gosh you can't say that I don't see an excuse me or this is like when she was\nAll over and it was a big problem but then you add what just happened there where there's obviously very racially inflammatory language being used in and people laughing and mocking\nTanya west to look I Know that he's a provocateur tour and people have all these very strong opinions on him but I I think that there was a line crossed there and I'm I don't understand how anyone doesn't feel like there was a La Crosse there\nBut you also get a bit of a window into how the left at this moment in time if they are grasping for reasons are grasping for for ways to justify or their intolerance of other ideas\nThe the rabid way in which they approach trying to destroy their enemies either we we have so few celebrities\nOn the right that speak or soap operas alright period and we have so few people that come out and and a spouse conservative principles that with someone of ... a level in celebrity land\nSays anything about being pro Trump H there's this mob that yes there is that word again this mob mentality to tear him down immediately it's one thing that they want to say\nWho cares but think about what a disparity there is in this realm you live every idiot\nCelebrity I Know we talked about you know I'm not saying she's an idiot but we're talking I don't know we're talking about Taylor Swift and uh you know her effort to help the Democrats in Tennessee in all these different celebrities out there you know George Clooney name one Tim Robbins and Susan surrender these ... these people were all just absolute\nHardcore left these Alec Baldwin\nAnd it was a really good actor I Wish he wasn't such a common ... all of them are on this one side and any of that and all the music artists to this is always the big joke with\nWhenever there's inauguration parties like you know the Obama inauguration parties where the the top recording artist in the world and the Trump recording artists were\nI don't know who's that guy told me he wasn't he one of them will put a boot in your is that a ... that's a different song actually at a different artists I don't know\nUh I also I like I think it's Clint Black Iraq 'em up and I roll I don't know there's some great some great country and things that I still remember out there I should listen to more country music that's that's one thing that's\nThat is that's come out of this conversation that I Can't think of any like if someone is your favorite country artist John I'd ... I'd have to go with I don't know Garth Brooks just because usually when I think all of the top of my head no no she Tommy is Garth Brooks it now come on any but\nUh well we don't have any of these artists and Kanye is out there and he said people are what are you talking about like yeah look I Adam Baldwin Nick Searcy a James Woods is Twitter account is awesome I mean there's there are some conservatives out there for sure but we have one high level music act like this\nAnd really more of a cult it'll keep more of a cultural icon not that I'm some big cognac fan or isn't gay or you see John the recall and with the shorthand it must be a when it's just why eat right yeah\nThat's right I work I mean technically I work for our media so I feel like I Need to\nKnow more about the music industry lingo\nShow but but they're they're piling on him and why last because they resent any loss of their ability to have a total echo chamber on the left when it comes to or echo chamber of fact in love when it comes to any cultural\nA music Hollywood figure\n... they they cannot abide it they cannot deal with it and I mean I Can't deal with them like they cannot psychologically process it it concerns them that worries them they don't they don't know what they would do they don't know how they would handle it if they didn't have all the celebrities that they know what I'm saying oh you're so great and climate change is terrible and\nOh all the stuff people really really do need to get it need to get a grip um and uh that's that's my that's one of my main takeaways from all this by the way um I Would just note that the switching gears or for a moment\nWe have a some others but so the hurricane Mike is made landfall right do we hold out of here here's what we've got on this so far\nThe biggest concern is everybody that that if the people they just chose not to evacuate ice I spent time the last few days going up and down the coast getting people to evacuate but this is a horrible\nHorrible storms [noise] a hundred and fifty plus miles an hour\nOr so at least twelve inches of rain sit for the thing that people I think don't realize is the storm surge weather is six feet or fourteen feet it's all deadly and I'm very concerned that people are not taking any consideration so we are ready to respond if we can help anybody now that chose not\nTo evacuate ah they have to hunker down and take care of themselves or we have Nineteen thousand or people that are already free physicians that gets the power back on ... I Am scared to death to people that chose not to back evacuated this is a just a horrendous storm and\nThat's the Governor Scott and Florida numbers or Mike first of all obviously thoughts and prayers everybody is affected I Know we've got a lot of great listener is a lot of folks down in Florida and we just hope everybody\nEveryone down in in in the state is is going to be All right through this whole thing it feels like this storm was kind of a kind of snuck up on people writing because the the hurricane before this\nThere was a lot of oh this is going to be a huge and we I mean I remember seeing it way out in the medical might get that you know that the Canary Islands like what's going on over there and and then this one though got really big really fast one was already close to ... am I Am I mistaken him that notion\nYeah no this one came out of nowhere and usually don't get many hurricanes up the Gulf Coast right I mean it's coming up to a point where it's they're not used to seeing it like Clearwater Beach Naples like that area I've been seeing it usually somebody usually from the Atlantic Gen right or the ... the east coast\nOf the four oh well I Hope everyone is All right I I'm ... I'm hearing that there's been a lot of a lot of people decided not to evacuated and we we just like I said doesn't preserve it would have more coming up here to seconds on the uh continued fallout from Kavanaugh\nLeft is still just [noise] living in this fantasy land of of they were going to raise this whole Kavanaugh situation they're going to find a way to to make it like it never happened and I just got to tell you I find that a distressing [noise]\nBut I have a solution for everybody I have a way I think the shutdown that tall [noise] not just going to city or complain about them complaining about cabinet I'm gonna tell you how we can get them to shut up about Cavanaugh\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home title fraud\nWith the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nIn a simple because all of whom titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy in home title lock found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had it been real this is the foot of taking out loans using books home is equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments ... showed up in that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud look if you own a home or rentals were have elderly parents get home title lock for pennies today home title\nRepublican just say okay you you you want to play that game we're going to reopen the Hillary email investigation and we're going to have a different a different attorney general a different department of justice looking at what let's see how that goes there is nothing that stopped the D. O. J. from doing that there's nothing to stop them from doing it\nBut now you started to get into the weak points in our whole system the weak point being that if you have people who are operating entirely in bad faith there really aren't any limits on it really ... there aren't any limits\nOn an investigation you do have a right to a speedy trial and hopefully a judge would enforce that although these days who knows\nBut you do not have the rights we should be the investigation\nIn fact in an investigation\nCan go on at ... at for for years on end bankrupt you some people I Know there's some people have actually taking deals meaning they've they pleaded guilty to something just to make the investigate just to make the investigation and the process and the the trial making all stock cars\nThey're already the process is the punishment\nSo the same way that also and Obama did this rather speaking about treading constitutional north Obama decided that using prosecutorial discretion he would effectively abrogate immigration law\nAnd say that if you're here legally you're not going to that you will not be deported we will create an extra legal process for you wonder you know the following conditions and he did that all under what is effectively prosecutorial discretion\nThere are lots of ways that the system can be abused if they are going to abuse of I used to be of the mind more of a I guess it's a traditionalist William F Buckley style can serve I used to be the mind that you know we have to we have to maintain the principles that he that they show quickly abandon\nBut from what I see happening in our politics today I take a position of you know we we've got actually beat them we've got to win otherwise we just suffer and\nAnd hope that there'll be better times when there's plenty of reason to believe that actually things will just keep getting worse and that's why yes there is there is a part of me that especially in the aftermath of capital and on any issue related to Kavanaugh says you've got to fight fire with fire and in this case that means if\nThey want to do this thing with Hillary we're going to have the da da da da de la ... told me who was fired let's remember that was fired from the FBI and is also I Believe under investigation for possibly leaking classified material\nLet's let's take a look at a at what the FBI determination would be or rather the deal Jay ... actually makes the decision not the FBI but whether to bring charges\nLet's see what the deal determination is about Hillary's emails this time around\nAll ... no we we shouldn't drag the country back into that they wanted the Democrats are openly advocating for dragging the country\nBack into that mess mess speaking the FBI by the way you know Rand Paul is that a tough year year and a half\nRand Paul was holding the FBI feet to the fire a little bit on something that used to get a lot of attention including in conservative circles and that is all this warrantless spying stuff you'd think they'd given all the Russia collusion insanity this would be a bigger topic here's what here's what Rand Paul to say\nWhile the FBI by and large is full of good people yourself included you have had some bad apples you had Peter Struck and his girlfriend talking about trying to bring the president town you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is that as Madison said men are not angels that's what we have the constitution that's where we asked you to get a warrant\nThe information you gather in the foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no\nConstitutional manner to that matter to that data and yet you once and then use it on domestic crime that has been our complained for years and years and years so you should not be allowed to access that data without a warrant\nI agree\nAnd I have to say it's a little concerning the given that now on the right we are very aware of the fact that the FBI deal Jay and the intelligence community were in part weaponized against Trump\nThat there has not been any real change in how these process these work or certainly there's been no legislation to prevent this from happening again\nIn remember this all happened after we already had the IRS targeting of the Tea Party this this all happened after we should have been aware that or political opponents in in our own country we're willing to abuse the apparatus of government for partisan purposes and there's been no real change\nThere's been you know instead of Democrats pretending like none of us really happened\nThey thought they were going to prove Trump Russia collusion all they're really proven is that the government is full of some deep state leftists who are completely and utterly willing to abuse whatever authority they have to achieve partisan and so you'd think it calls for more oversight and maybe some legislation but uh apparently not\n\nTeam it as an honor and privilege to bring in my thoughts on all the things that matter to us as Americans every day and you know your opinion matters to that's why I Want to tell you about a new social media site that lets you be heard that lets you share your thoughts without any of the left

I like the libertarian not they're not lives\nThere libertarians\nOther interesting that politically they're annoying because in some states they'll run a candidate who will be the difference maker between the Republican getting elected and not and then they always go you know but you know we've got to shake things up and no I just wish you I just kind of wish\nYou wouldn't cause these problems literature and smoke just as much as I Love you love the libertarians but sometimes you get in the way a little bit of there's this piece in\nReason about uh about a woman who had a consensual or a consensual I guess called hook up right they were in college\nAnd then later on changed her mind and then brought charges under title nine and guess what even with they read this essentially retroactive withdrawal of consent and after\nThe fact oh actually I didn't really consent even though at the time I did consent and under title nine and these kangaroo courts that are set up\nYes what are they\nFound him or he was he was in some way punished as you've found liable for this\nUh you finally had to some people coming out and ... for example that there must be a standard if there is not a standard this will be abused and there has to be evidence and this has to be brought it in the first lady herself in an interview\nWe have that uh no we don't have that are well fair enough the first lady yourself in the ... she said you have to present evidence if you're going to make these accusations USA Today published a piece\nNow I was going to say today but it's actually a dare dare go ethic quote I Am a sexual assault survivor and I don't want you to just take my word for it\nAnd the er the sub heading here is I'm thankful I cannot condemn the man without evidence I was assaulted fourteen years ago due process the due process laws that protect him also protect me right this is this is where are you really get down to it\nYou either believe that there are laws in process season place for all people where you don't it doesn't get it doesn't shift based on whether you think somebody is a victim or they have been traumatized you know in terms of whether there is a process or not\nIf you have no process just because you like one person or don't like another or because of the specific circumstances are there then you're just you're making this into\nDueling accusations and allegations with no real way of sorting it out and justice will not be served if there's if there's no process\n[noise] but they didn't want justice that's why a Kamala Harris and saying oh you know the thing was limited scope ... what we're going to have an unlimited in scope background check you know theoretically you could have a background check that goes on forever is that what that is what they want they want a background check that goes on and to\nThe Senate takes or the Democrats like the ... that's that's when he generation of the background check would be acceptable anything up to that anything that does not take them over the over the finish line\nOf Democrats control the Senate would be an insufficient background check that would be unacceptable\nThere you have it uh that's [noise] that's\nI think the ... that's all we really need to know about their assessment of how this all out is always\nThe FBI Director I don't know how I don't know how we hold back his contempt for some of these senators the nose or just playing games but I guess everybody knows there's [noise]\nThere's debris flying around a lot of damage below it out there\nHurricane Michael hit Florida like a freight train hurling in with one hundred and fifty mile an hour winds the strongest ever to hit the panhandle flattening trees ... and flooding straight surprisingly only one death reported it's tearing through Georgia now near Albany\nWe obviously our concern is unlike any song that we've had\nGovernor Nathan Deal telling residents to watch out for each other Michael is weakening rapidly but still a hurricane with wins as eighty five miles an hour ... President Trump's playing it up then Erie, Pennsylvania\nDemocrats the party of crime\nHe's on the campaign trail pushing the party line in trying to drum up support for Republicans in next month's midterm elections\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nFifty [noise]\nThat was you know because when it comes to those places we saw never saw [noise]\nSo an\nOp ed in head or on an op ed from ... op ed confirms that this is the Washington Post a central issue of twenty Eighteen\nIs health care I've seen polling suggests this is the case that people are likely to cast votes based upon their perception of health care what is really going on here what is the state of health care right now as it relates to the midterms and just in general what's going on because somebody can answer this question for us\nRoy is with us now he's the president for the foundation for research on equal opportunities also a Forbes editor over great to have you say buck so a ... first of all is this is this concept what'd you say it's accurate I mean are\nAre we are we seeing data to suggest that people as much as we all get told by the media it's all about Trump's tweets and Russia collusion and Kavanaugh that it actually might be health care the tips the balance of the of the\nHouse and the senator one or the other side of the ...\nWell I I haven't seen any polling data fucking I've looked at it pretty closely at at this particular question I haven't seen any polling data to suggest that health care right now his motives motivating people to\nTurn out ah for November of having a obviously is a much bigger driver but I Will say that if Democrats are successful retaking the house or whether or not to take the Senate if they just take the house\nUm and even if they don't somehow whatever happened the midterms are going to be over you know this fuck your listeners know this was seen as the midterms over literally within hours limit turns being over what are we going to start talking about\nThe twenty twenty presidential election in particular in this case the Democratic primary for who's going to challenge Trump and what that primary is going to be all about but it's all going to be about\nWho is going to outbid who who's going to be the true blue purists on single payer Democrats in the primary for president are going to fight over this issue and what Trump is doing in this op ed is he's firing his initial salvo for his reelection campaign\nSo ... where is the healthcare debate right now for a between Republicans and Democrats as it stands today I mean you're you're mentioning ... you're you're talking about where the left will go after this election whereas the left positioning itself where Democrats positioned themselves right now and and what is the Republican pitch on healthcare\nHere one of the things that's been fairly interesting and you may have talked about this on your program in the past is that democratic ads about health care and the midterms are actually they're spending more money on health care as the Republicans are\nThey're talking a lot about this Texas lawsuit a which aims to overturn Obamacare the uh by attacking the preexisting conditions provision and Obamacare\nAnd so what you have a lot of democratic congressmen and candidates saying is that Republican I'm running against he's against protecting you from a high insurance payments because of preexisting conditions\nOn for protecting you from that from me so there is a lot of these rape is a lot of talk about pre existing conditions when I'm\nOn Capitol Hill I hear that all the time members asking me like you know what should we do about pre existing conditions\nSo that that is that's the thing you're hearing a lot of it you're not hearing so much about single payer the single payer thing is really about twenty twenty\nSingle payer you think is now going to or I should say is going to be the Democratic party official ... an official position on healthcare once we're heading into twenty twenty you're you're confident of that\nI'm certain of it's just like repeal and replace for the Republicans right like what Republicans wanted to be against repealing Obamacare running in elections in the last ten years right similarly progressive to dominate the left wing primaries in Democratic Party\nIf you don't say you're for single payer you're not going to win\nAt all you're going to have a primary challenge so every Democrat feels that pressure from the left and frankly most of them genuinely philosophically want single payer even though they believe most most intelligent Democrats believe it's unrealistic and could never happen\nThey do philosophically would they would prefer government takeover of health care system so yeah they're not going to they're not going to deny that therefore single air they're going to say yeah I'm for single or they're all going to climb over each other to talk about how pro single payer there\nHow how accurate worthy early GOP projections that I always you know over you've been involved in this discussion stretching back for a long time\nBut how accurate were the projections are of how damaging and bad Obamacare would be you know I remember this was like the fiercest political discussion in the country back in the early days the Obama administration\nAs the Reverend Al Sharpton who some will remember from when he was pedaling the yes the rape hoax\nPerpetrated by wanna Brawley who went on to lose in court a defamation case a federal this she than a sexually refused to pay and it has since moved into obscurity Africa they did some update on to want to Brawley a few years ago and found that\nShe was living somewhere and just trying to avoid having to pay anything on the defamation settlement that she uh she lost so you can imagine\nWhen you hear today from people saying oh are you blaming the victim well the court blamed the so called victim they're these so called survivor 'cause she wasn't a victim are survivors we found out but let's say focus for a moment on they stop and frisk point because Trump brought this up he gave a speech what was the early and we mentioned stop and frisk for Chicago\nAnd here's what they say about this\nThey won't claim that New York the most visible single place to have instituted a stop and frisk policy and it was done under Mayor Bloomberg was we know from\nToday Democrat Bloomberg was Democrat he was an independent member remember when he says you those those are those speeches about the snow\nAnd then and then they would they had the interpreter and and and but Bloomberg would go into a little like he'd be like ... Mayor Bloomberg God Bless bad and you all you do as little Bloomberg Espanol ... I I\nThat was great that was great those are simpler tires producer Mike Mayor Bloomberg would slip into his\nHundred words of Spanish that he spoke in order to just let it let New Yorkers know\nThat the you know\nThe snow is cold and they will move it we we wrap you do that was only seen the ... coming\nI Know we we didn't know what we had you see the Blasio are read by the way he's so there's the mayor of New York city and gave me a needs to be told that\nA major city hit somebody ... was talking about housing for the homeless he's like I'm Sorry I'm In the middle of my work out it's like oh you mean that worked out that you do at the gym that requires a fleet of SUVs and take you an hour from the mayor's mansion\nIt because you like that Jim in Brooklyn but this guy doesn't do anything all day it's an hour to get there an hour to get back he works out I guess for our we know that he spends all of his time on the elliptical let's be real lotta stretching it a lot of electrical\nAnd then when somebody comes up to them in the gym is a public official he gets all Snoopy about it he's a he's a sniffy just a few minutes anyway um\nI just I'm just saying Bloomberg maybe running as a as a Democrat or he was the one or he's gonna run as a Democrat at least that's what people are saying as of today run for the twenty twenty race\nHe had stop and frisk what a stop and frisk alright it allows people to allow law enforcement to on\nA reasonable suspicion stop and talk to you and then if they think it is necessary for safety they can pat you down now they say that this is inherently racist and the reason for that is that you have a\nLarge number of these stop and frisk the hundreds and thousands hundreds of thousands of these stops that occurred over a period of many years in New York they say oh well you had a disproportionate number of\nA black and Hispanic males who were stopped and either talk to or poor padded down looking for weapons and some people say it's racist\nInteresting when you actually crunched the numbers on that you find out that as a as it relates to the proportion in New York City of crimes committed by people who fall into the demographic of black or Hispanic males they were actually stopped bless\nWhen you control for the number of crimes committed by people in different categories less than their share overall but still people say it's bad optics and they say that you know it looks bad on them and then they they point to the fact that New York is in a crowd and continued downward trajectory on crime part is that\nReality for America's biggest city has been ongoing for a long time you know this is like showing up in\nIn the in the final stages of something and saying well this is this happened because I showed up but it's like wow it was already happening in the crime was already happening\nThe only point I think that's very fair to make on this is that conservative along did say to get her to stop and frisk there'll be a big spike in crime and we haven't seen that in New York City okay so that's a little bit of the background on stopping for Trump\nIs saying let's just stop and frisk in Chicago\nAnd the ACLU types and all and they freak out of a stop and frisk but here's the thing but to stop and frisk in Chicago nobody had any ideas for how to make Chicago a less\nCrime ridden place I mean it does the number of shootings people think if a ... and I look that obviously is going to get the most headlines because when you have a weekend in Chicago with twelve people killed\nOr you know more than that in some way to get whatever it is I mean they've had these these weekends with forty fifty people shot you look at the number of shot it in a low it's in a low thousands in Chicago all and people getting shot or stabbing a given year that's a lot of people\nAre getting shot no one has any solutions or any ideas for this all I hear from lives and I get to talk to them\nWhen they come on on the hill TV show all your from lives is we need to invest more in schools I'm like yeah 'cause that's why the gang bangers selling drugs it it's it's because there's not enough investment a local public school and come out in this isn't serious but they they have no idea is no solutions for whatsoever and what you find is that\nYou know they don't want to talk about real structural change like why do we\nAll the studies show that the the biggest single terminal whether a neighborhood if you know how many ...\nBoth parents are are in a neighborhood statistically speaking you have a very good sense of what the crime rate will be and that when you control for intact household meaning you know a a mother and father both in the household the crime rate is essentially the same across all uh\nAll all cultures and all ethnic background\nAll of them have her winning within that margin of error doesn't that tells us something was wrong I mean the New York times had what was it Ninety seven percent chance of Hillary winning on election day and that's not that's not how it went all these people who spend their lives spend every day\nTrying to tell all of the rest of us including me even though I work in this business to what's going to happen in the election they were they were way off and I think that the narrative\nFormation that's going on right now which is trying to convince people the mainstream media is trying to convince people that the Kavanaugh effect isn't real that Republicans aren't as United aren't a rallying to each other side on this issue it as they actually are\nUm the ideas to suppress turnout among Republicans oh no it's there's not going to be there is not going to be a backlash because\nOf the Salem witch trial that the Senate Democrats put on for capital there's not going to be on or don't expect anything for that\nNot gonna make any difference at all meanwhile if you look at what's going on right now with the with the house but the Senate you have\nSeven Senate toss up seats in play\nRight now it's you know leans forty renounced forty nine GOP forty four damn based on the based on the polls oh that's that's where that is well sorry that's where it is\nAnd based on the polling they think that it will probably go with the G O P actually taking the are taking this at so that's a good thing that's good news in the house it's\nThirty to toss ups according to the real clear politics average here thirty to toss ups which means\nThat the Republicans are going to have to buck the trend I Know ... or in order to in an\nOff year in a a mid year ... mid term cycle as a party in power manage to hold onto their majorities will see governors races by the way geo piece looking pretty good there too\nSo despite all the things you hear it right now I I think that we should just remember not only does history show us that\nThis stuff can be wrong I must say will be 'cause I don't believe anybody can predict the future is you know I'm very consistent with that I think that you can you can have some fun or with your speculation on prognostications especially as a political pundit because no one ever forget your losers producer Mike it's like the secret to be a good stock broker just got to make sure you focus on your winters meant\nIf you're right fifty percent of the time but you're really charming guy who tells everybody about all your winters\nVery successful stockbroker one remembers all losers don't pay enough attention so\nIn politics same thing it's got to make you make it a few bold predictions you get one or two of them right and all of a sudden you\nAre the sheer\nOf all things political or the fact that by the way you get\nThe Senate race in New Jersey we Menendez the fact that that's even competitive I Know it's Jersey and I know you're a Jersey resident producer Mike\nI Know you're you're you're a you're a sophisticated Jersey fellow by the way John we liked the Mike beer do it the my beard is good you guys got a real got some real facial hair going on now\nEverybody loves it except the parents what\nIs it with parents not like you know what it is you're their little their little my you know you're always little little Mike yeah so you know they they think of you as being the same thing with me my parents don't like facial hair I mean either\nSent my parents' picture last night I was out some friends and the Senate pictures you know shown where I was and get the responses from on one for that [laughter]\nThey're both like what's with the ... what's going on my mom's like I said I'll send you a raise or how they are\nYeah but this is the stuff that I'm getting a columnist in the office so I'm keeping it and the leaders and the officer all fence and they think the\nBeer that can be very very distinguished but you know it's a generational thing two beers or in right now if you go back to the seventies and everybody had the uh the you know the airline pilots stash widely\nAirline pilots still keep the stash never got an answer to this though whenever they have some kind of an\nAirline related incident and all of a sudden you get these former pilots on TV they they all\nHave the stash Kelly ... they've all got the ... which you know hey look they pull it off I I give them credit for it but are this generation right\nNow of people that are thirties forties lot lot of beers a lot of facial hair a lot of tattoos also\nI remember when you add tattoos if you were a biker or a sailor and now everybody's got ... I just came back from Vegas you can't you go down by the pool and it's like a tattoo symposium or for for 'em or what I mean it's it's like a museum of tattoos\nWhen you're out there everywhere and all over the place to look I mean I'm fine with it I'm just\nI don't have any I don't know nine out of ten of people that I've talked to have tattoos regret at least one of them or something about it I always get that view\nUm no I get ... everyone I Know that ... is is pretty much all they don't really yeah I I don't know any but unless they've got the full ... leave them running around that time and painful\nYeah there you go\nMike are they going to take the are they going to hold the house what do you think Republicans I got a shot\nAbsolutely when I like it absolutely you're that you hear that producer John ... as you know buck is to shape public opinion yes and in a way off and as\nWe get closer it gets more realistic so the pollsters don't look like fools\nAnd they're going to win the same thing over as was two years ago\nI I certainly hope so because if nothing else just dealing with the liberal reaction to having Trump with\nA majority in the house and the Senate and going for that's going to be amazing\nWhat ... what do they tell themselves what I tell themselves then ... what do they say\nIf Trump has been present for two years and he and his party stays in power\nMaybe the lips have some a spleen and to do\nYou ever find yourself when sitting at the weak taste of coffee from one of those left leaning corporate brands you probably thought I Wish they spent less time on meaningless biased trading bathroom policy and other stuff that defies common sense\nAnd more time on coffee that's why you need black rifle coffee I drink black rival every day\nIn fact I've got my entire crew at the hill T.

[noise]\n\nHe's holding the line for America bug sex is that [noise]\nA little while ago I wrote a story\nAbout how women tried to bring an emotional support peacock\nOn an airplane with her and I thought you know as crazy as that is at least give her points for creativity because ... yeah you can obviously bring your emotional support elephant on the plane to bake not off like none of leg room but could you bring a peacock theoretically on a plane with you yes you could\nNow people are starting to crack down on this and and I've got to say that there is a I've got mixed emotions about it there was a woman who tried to get on a flight from frontier airlines in Orlando, Florida or just a few days ago and she\nHeld this flight up for two hours you know why John she wanted to bring on her emotional support\nSquirrel and sure enough they\nHad a problem with that because there is a policy that frontier airlines does not allow rodents aboard flight so they they are and she wrote inch at frontier airlines little harsh harsh\nA but I've got to say if you're trying to expand your your horizons for what could be a ... a good pet turns out that I Know that rats believe it or not and this is really this is weird for some folks rats are pretty smart and can make good pets\nWhen you see them in the subway to do here in New York City you think to yourself why would anybody ever want to have one of those they look terrifying to carry all kinds of diseases but if you keep rats clean they are pretty smart and can make affectionate pets so I Would think a score it would be in the same category so that she does a part of me John it's like hey\nMaybe she's got a really close bond\nWith this world maybe the squirrel\nIs very meaningful to her and you can't separate a person from their emotional support squirrel but then there's the other side of me that had to wait for hours and hours just last week for Southwest Airlines flight that was delayed John it was supposed to take off as a one hour flight\nFrom Las Vegas to San Diego and it was going to take off at eight thirty in the morning do you know when that flight actually took off seven pm at night\nAlmost eight twelve hour delay for not for whether whether it's whether right that's that's a that's gods deciding that you're going to have a bad day or no for mechanical issues\nI can tell you that I lose patients very quickly when I'm In that airport lab not lounge airport area you know the little chairs they set up at all face each other it's kinda creepy sit there you have to look at somebody else you tend not to be staring at them but you're staring at them\nAnd they don't want you to I was ... you don't want to lose your temper uh but what can you do there's not much you can do show on the one hand I feel like emotional support squirrel I'm sympathetic on the other hand I feel like\nIf I were there and I was told that somebody was holding up my flight for a couple of hours so that they have their emotional support squirrel handy or I might make some squirrel could Bob I might just lose it\nAnd I bet squirrels probably not a particularly tasty meat but I Would feel I find out one way or the other that squirrel that that emotional supports world would probably be toast and I'm going to get all the hey bill from Peter now but we eat we eat out all kinds of animals you know I eat\nObviously cow and paying pigs are smart I've actually hung out with pet pigs before will micro pigs that are kind of a fun thing ... why do we draw the line John at squirrels\nWhy do we discriminate against emotional support squirrels but we think that cat somehow or the superior species\nI don't have an answer for you the truth is if you gave me the choice between the pets growing pet cat I don't know

passes overhead and so it was my little shut up and I drove people there in Florida in Georgia and all the places being affected by\nHurricane Michael so anyway\nSo what we were talking about today let me just to get back to what we're talking about night so I'm really I'm fascinated here and that are not going to let up until I get to the bottom is okay\nI'm fascinated by the comments coming out of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and the messaging extraterrestrial intelligence that ... and they're beginning to act as though they located something okay they're not telling us they've located somebody but I've had several meetings one in California University of California Irvine\nThey had a workshop in Texas just a few weeks ago on how to identify technical signatures in space it's one of the reasons why we brought the black Cuban skull on because we wanted to talk about this techno signatures and maybe some people up and we can pick up on low frequency higher frequency whatever\nSo\nWe have to look at various ways did aliens will be will make contact with this or how we make contact with that money on this program as well I mean not just the black you but we've also at times even run brought this up we used to reduce\nWe'd blow into did reduce and we'd blow them over the over the Arab world they did reduce over the years\nHopes that the signal would go out on all the radio\nIt was all over the country and all the signals all over the country we send the huge orange found this ancient\nSound I'm sure aliens would understand and listened to\n\nAnd uh you know and and nights we do this we've had like UFO's sightings you had all kinds of cool things going on\nI just last night we had a a a huge fireball come down out of the sky silent Oregon in Lincoln county up you were telling you about it that we just got tired and Jeremiah calling the program and less are seen that they said that was the only guy to report it and they saw they wonder if anybody else thought\nAnd apparently it had an impact a little bit of boom there\nBut see I've been reading a lot of things lately about this whole techno signature clue stuff and for more advanced uh you know what they're looking for more advanced civilizations using these techniques signatures\nWell I also was reading that there are some people that are bitter believing that uh that there's more to it than just listening for the techno signatures so that we may be\nUnder the control of some of these techno signatures as a human ears picked up on the signals and unbeknownst to most people it's affecting them in different ways so far there's been no need to panic because they don't know which is how the sequels affecting people but it certainly has affected people in the truth is\nThat there are plenty of extraterrestrial signals out there the world it'd be the whole universe is awash in extraterrestrial signals that we can't even perceive\nOr do we even know about unless someone else ... basically says listen that you hear that that's what we're looking at right now the end so city in many\nThe guy that runs city and Medi spend a lot of time wondering how these messages are being transmitted they're hoping they can find a source before more people pick up on this sounds at the moment they you know because it buried it actually buried in the\nBackground of earth newly\nBut uh like I said some people were already hearing this pulsating sound I recently there was a a story out of Sweden where a mysterious humming sound was recorded this sounded a constant pulsing home but according to witnesses lasted forty five minutes to an hour\nA there was there's a film on the Internet going by right now a snow covered mountains ... out in the middle of nowhere you living out there are a bunch of guys on a on a\nSnowmobiles and they come by occasionally but what you hear is just a really low frequency hum and here's that sound this is from a northern Switzerland or a man by the name of Renee ...\nHad a record of this back in December after a snow fall just recently got the attention of a paranormal investigator sitting here is that home\nNo that's not the hummus try another one it's a wait a minute [laughter] here's behind that was from Utah here's into um\n[noise]\n\nSo this was filmed by a man named Renee ... back in December mysterious humming noise that he picked up on he said that uh it was rattling the house she said that he was a like it was rattling the sky\nOr very missed it by you said it was like something was moving from one end of the sky to the other\nBig could not figure out what it was it was like so many visible thing will be across the sky was rumbling a sonics out\nIn August there was a report of another home near ... way proving grounds which of course egg white proving ground some people say is the northern arm of every fifty one it's in Utah I've been there it has a lot of ah gates in danger science don't go in there and uh\nSo here's the sound of the home it that way which is a little bit more aggravating to hear but here it is\n[noise]\n\nKnow earlier I had talked about how a sound like bees the humming Swede and in the ... in ah Utah Doug way reminded me of a well known a recording of police officers in Saint Helens Oregon\nUh they said they saw white a bright light on the Columbia River at four thirty in the morning or for twenty three in the morning\nAnd they wanted to be able to record the sound of this ship this space ship as it was taking off from the Columbia and I wanted to play that moment against

very interesting and um so I did a little research on it because it was my understanding that you know neutrinos generally just write my research I found out they were getting you know from a number of sorts\nA a blaze all large metallic cloud um\nAnd and the sitting overnight scene eighty seven eight mhm and and um and and the fact that neutrino or detectors have to be buried so\nVery very deep in the ground and they have to be extremely large or what worked where it came to my attention is this was in an article where are you know at the polls\nA media writes in in media or they're they're all they're they're found very easily and and it's commonplace to find things that just fall who stay\nIn in that and touch reaching the ... of our planet right um so you know it came to mind a lot of tension that what if while they were building this neutrino detectors since it has to be so deep in the ground so large\nThat they ran across something they found something that lady shouldn't have been ... you know ... and and and that may explain these new or a microorganism\nWas he that's it you know in my ... from from whatever they may have filed was building this detectors or the question is you know for each\nOne is the fall out why does it go against the the uh when they called the classic model these go against everything the classic model opera see right not son particles\nHe's aren't new apart these aren't these are not neutrinos through the sun's not neutrinos from perhaps the quasars something else these are neutrinos from or what we call break off from any kind of I guess nuclear fuel or anything it would be similar to nuclear fuel so this is it is somebody that doesn't belong on this planet\nIs being a ... for the Antarctic ... space\nExactly because you know neutrinos generally follow one path and um the majority of them was perpendicular throughout pointed and we're finding their detect the large numbers of these\nAre coming from the polls you know that that that's\nThat's a bit odd out you know make a magnetic field or or whatever even affect the trajectory of be the dominant particle right and ... and you know\nIt it just really concerns me 'cause well you know they they detect this have to be buried deep underground in deal with a water\nAnd in in order to the you know to detect neutrinos that large numbers of\nIt has to bounce off a particle right have they hit a war tomorrow or a heavy water ... you write and what we need it said he'd be water molecule it creates a splash that the detector can detect and that's how they detected neutrinos\nNow while they're building this incredibly large apparatus this you know this has been\nEased a trainer detectors are quietly is not quite as widely known as the er here has drawn a collider right at least those things are models twenty miles law in in circumference now they used to take these neutrino detectors\nThey're not quite as large right but they are in the vicinity of a
