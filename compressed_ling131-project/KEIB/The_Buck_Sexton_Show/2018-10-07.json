A. S. T. P. A. S. S. ... have you looked at a dash lane already since you didn't ask me the name of that\nWell I got tired of exactly what you said there just wasn't sure exactly what the second one was\nThat because my addiction is so poor you know it was in a terrible not at all not at all [laughter] so using these things\nIs uh is something that a lot of people who were in data security recommend as we're still going they'll question we're going to move away from user names and passwords were going to go to alternative technologies\nTo recognize who you are but for now where it this way station of user names and passwords and if you did not want\nTo go to the expense of Daschle in our last past and alternative that data security people recommend is extremely long phrases\nRight and the vet and instead of doing all this stuff they had us do for a while with upper case lower case numbers symbols alpha all that that none of that prevents the crux\nThat going to a very long usually weird phrase that makes no sense but it's something that you'll remember\nIs considered to be the best alternative to using one of the password managers\nRight well thank you very much I\nBest to you my wife uses the most sophisticated\nSystem that she dreamt up for user names and passwords\nAnd it's one of those things it's so brilliant what she came up with that I'd love to share it with you but if I did it wouldn't work for anybody but if you can come up with something that's very very clever and long\nThe you'll remember the pattern that you've established then you will have much better security\nDo you know it's like you're about\nTo say something you know I was just going you want to take a blast clerks sure okay All right so a Dana wrote in clerks had my daughter signed up at credit report dot com she made an account there when she went into her account the day after signing up she was sent a message saying that she would need to pay a one dollar fee to find out her FICA score we thought that this site was free why that charge\nWill credit report dot com is not the uh the federally sanctioned approved Web site that is just a one of the many websites out there that make credit reports available

he said he couldn't keep more of what you may [noise]\nWhy do you want to keep more of what you make\nSo you have options in your life so you have choices so that you build in some freedom into your life to make the decisions he want to make you don't want to be one of the people who I oh why oh why oh softer work I go\nAnd that's why I talk so much about the importance on living on less than what you make\nAn saving money each and every month each and every pay period we in the United states culturally are terrible at that the average American saves around three cents for each dollar he or she makes\nAnd if you listen to me for a long time you know that that compares a poorly to a lot of other countries in the world where it's routine that people say thirty percent of what they make\nBut there is a counter movement in the United states\nAre people who think heavily influenced by what they saw happened to so many people getting crushed last decade by the great recession\nThat people have become fears about living on less than what they make certainly not everybody but it's even got a name FIRE movement\nAnd it's about being financially independent so you can retire early but not necessarily retire early it's really about the first two letters financial independence were you then have the choice of what you want to do with your wife\nAnd the people that are big into the FIRE movement are also big into austerity sometimes too extreme with austerity but it's what works for them\nAnd I'm a big fan of what used to be called max savers those are people who live on half of what they make\nAnd a lot of people that are with this modern FIRE movement or in many ways echoing what was part of the Mac saving movement of a different era\nAnd there was a a pod cast with someone I've been on our podcast before ... it was a podcast that she had she had Suzie Orman as a guest\nAnd asked Suzie Orman what she thought of the FIRE movement expecting Suzie Orman to say it's wonderful this great people are saving so much money and said she said I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it\nAnd\nHeard about this and I was like why what's there to hate about people living on less than what they make\nAnd she went on to talk about\nThe fact that the amount of money that FIRE movement people\nHad his goals to save too with an independent life were ridiculous dollars that people really need to have a [laughter] twenty thirty fifty or a hundred million dollars be like me okay\nSuzie come on you're allowed to touch their [laughter]\nPeople don't need twenty million dollars or like you a hundred million dollars that sort of you have to live and independent life and be comfortable it's all about the lifestyle that you become comfortable with it so the key is a ratio is a formula\nAnd it's pretty simple you save money to the point that you saved twenty five times the amount of money that it costs to live in one year\nAnd once you hit that target whether it's in your thirties forties fifties sixties or never\nThat's when you know you have enough money built up for the lifestyle you've grown accustomed to that you can afford to live in definitely on the money you say\nAnd it I Know that's an oversimplification but it really is that simple as soon as he went on to say the power that you need at least five or six million really you might need ten million dollars", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "07"}
