{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "I'm paying mind you're paying years well yeah that's right yeah I Know but that's why I'm debt free 'cause I'm cheap show you're paying your own and so um you know you just call it out and you just have some fun with it laugh about it'd be sarcastic about at whatever your family gift is right and I'm In some of them are going to be upset but if they're going to be upset 'cause you don't buy their food\nThen well oh well you know\nAnd as far as friends go do the same thing but if this is a continual thing then we just aren't you know it's not a real friend because a friend that you have to bother relationship that's called prostitution that's not friend okay and so um you know I don't have to buy my friendships\nMy my friends I've got friends that are wealthier than me and friends that are nowhere near as wealthy as me I'm doesn't matter I might buy dinner but that's my choice not on their expectation\nI'm and I'm pretty generous um I've done a lot but I don't I don't think anything about it but the point my wife is like you really don't need to pay every time I but I don't I'm not worried about it is but if I ever since somebody being title I get all hillbilly and a second you know I'd be like no you're not entitled\nUm and my wife has a little bit more\nUh she has this thing about fairness and so she wants everything to be fair and I'm just here trying to explain to her fingers what happens at the county fair is not going to happen but but you know you just ... that's okay I mean you talk it through is what I'm saying and\nYou're gonna find occasionally somebody that you're not going to be able to continue in relationship with and um that could even be family if it's extreme but hopefully it's not something like that that's very hurtful for you but um most of the time it's just like no you know we're paying our share you pay your shirt and split it up\nOr this time we're going to give you a gift and we're going to pay for everything but that's on your option is not a gift if it's entitled me so it's a good question though um and that happens\nMore\nIt probably happens more to people with family than it does with French\nI mean you got a real low class group of friends of all your friends expect you to pick up the tab all the time just because your debt free I mean you're running with some try to a park trash you know I mean really\nYou you you got to think about that I just I that that really it's more of a family thing for most people um I Will tell you that honestly\nAs weird it is for us um was sharing and I 'cause we're kind of in the spotlight uh we've had very little boundary issues with family or friends on this we've been really blessed were really fortunate and uh so that's the tip of the ...\nTo both of them that we've had almost no times that we've had to sit down with a friend and go uh nope and almost\nNo times with family I mean it's um but our families are you know responsible hardworking people I mean I kind of thing and so it's just that we're blessed in that way because I Know people that you know they get their record deal when\nAll of a sudden some cousin they didn't even know comes out of the woodwork you know and uh I've not had that I Know I've got some cousins that I don't hardly know but none of them came out of the woodwork they stayed in the woodwork good for them so not looking for money away I wouldn't mind seeing some of them but I mean don't come looking for money we don't even know you are\nSo um it it's something everybody deals with I think you know you hear people like it the ... when the ...\nAnd and then crazy sets in and their family and arts I I'll tell you where else I run into its where they fell players\nMan they got a big signing bonus and crazy comes out of the woodwork on them I mean they get some dysfunctional crap in their laps it's amazing and are people who feel entitled to a piece of their success and it it it really is really as an illness it's a problem\nStephanie is with us from Birmingham Hi Stephanie what's up in your world\nMary how are you ... just the same Donald talking to help\nWe ought to have a quick or back a lawyer but thank you thank you have to go into him and I am really close to any homerun good for you\nGot a question about ... um I have about forty ... have their own forty thousand dollar come home mhm\nYeah go ahead and hanging out with or without and our ... ... ... it could be at my American you're from Africa now\nNow you're emergency fund should be three to six months of expenses anything above that I Would throw at the mortgage\nOh okay\nAnd I would take you all the way down to a thousand dollars on baby steps six I Want you to your baby step three is the emergency fond of three to six months of expenses what's your household income\n'em right it would have to hear good for you how old are your parents here have you got any other data other than the home\nYou know they got any money other than this forty K uh having my call waiting ... good how much is in that\nI'm writing a book out and\nYou're doing so good way to go well Well Don you're winning yeah okay so uh what would you say your monthly expenses would be a couple of grand maybe three Graham\nRight about twenty five hundred right\nAnd if we should three months so that would be Seventy five hundred that means we would throw thirty two thousand five hundred dollars at the forty thousand dollar mortgage how fast you're going to be all that other Seventy five hundred then\n[laughter] ... yeah how fast\n... America mode yet I'm working every day we got him to come out right but yeah so that was ... and yeah\nYou're done you got it and so six months from now your debt free but you were not left at risk\nOf an emergency hitting and having only a thousand dollars because that's not what we do with these at this point in the baby steps at this point the baby steps we keep our three months and let's hold that Seventy five hundred there so if you have a little bump in the road you don't have a problem because I don't want you have a paid for house and no money\nOkay that that's not that you know that you have to dig up the bushes to eat or something later you know we want to do that so uh but you're gonna you're gonna be debt free by spring house and everything if we do this plant\nAnd ... fold lonely at the top but I like lonely [laughter]\nSo you don't have a lot of people in your life that are cheering you own them\nNo they will not leaking\nMe I've been trying to do they weigh on this ... years [laughter]\nWell I'm honored to have you as one of our cheerleaders and you can consider me one of yours I think you're impressive you've done some really good stuff fifty years old do underground in the bank and paid for out by spring and your emergency fund joined a running your four one K. I beg your rock star I think you're doing really really well\nVery good job very good job and I suspect if you're like most families that means you've changed your family tree you've changed the whole way of operating probably nobody in your family's ever accomplish what you have it goes most families haven't it doesn't matter\nYou know that's all that's a huge huge deal jacks on Twitter how can I deal with my spouse who wants to make payments on everything\nWell I don't think she wants to make payments on everything she wants to buy anything she wants is what that\nReally means and so it sounds like you're either married to someone who is not informed about how money works are ignorant about our money works and so we can do some teaching or you're married to a princess ... and um [noise] our stuff done help princes marriage counseling helps that and and\nClear proof one way or the other so let's factor it in\nWe heard so much about how she'd be the polygraph I shouldn't say well that was maybe friday and right there she was cleared by the polygraph maybe you could say polygraph said that she was not being deceptive she was being truthful what if she knows how to be deceptive than a polygraph\nIf he knows how to do that by the way that would that indicate that she lied under oath and if you lied under oath about the polygraph and by the way I still don't believe that she took the polygraph not knowing she was going to come forward so I've always thought that was a lie but if you lie under oath about taking the polygraph then\nWe know that she's not delusional then she's actually a malicious actor here and given that we've been told including by sending US Senators that millions of lives are at stake\nMillions of women's lives are at stake if Kavanaugh gets on the Supreme Court which is insane thing to say that it is pretty widespread among Democrats\nWhy is it so hard to believe that somebody would try and do something that they would view as a great act of heroism and that they will be heralded for on the left for generations to come for that or do you think that that's that show and think of all\nThat's so\nNot credible really I find that hard to believe\nThose who today we're criticizing Trump for weighing in here seem to forget that just because there are allegations are now falling apart it doesn't mean that the rest of us have forgotten how disgusting how disgraceful how underhanded they have been all along in their effort to try and derail his cabinet nomination\nThat has been their purpose and they have been willing to do anything and everything in order to get there that they're now is a more defensive position than they have been\nYou know ... I saw how to another sworn declaration today that a person was at parties in the eighties there was drinking insects and and knew the Kavanaugh is that these parties I mean at what point are we just put it in high school drinking and socializing\nOr in some kind of weird public trial here ... there there's no names there's no allegations of specific criminality\nYeah ... I I I'll swear I'll swear testimony out that I went to a party long time ago and there are people who are drinking and having premarital sex and that was happening\nOkay that's not ... you can't just prove that you're not gonna get in trouble for perjury it also doesn't prove anything they have an easy thing it was election I keep I keep running into they should be ashamed but are they have no shame and they view this as an ends justifies the means to a situation and that's why I Want to remind everybody right\nNow we've got to keep our eye and the ball here this has never been this has never been about getting to the\nTruth is delay is not about getting to the truth it's not about being fair to Kavanaugh or even respecting the process in any meaningful sense this has been do anything to get the Democrats' way that's\nWhat this is and I'm concerned we've got a lot of time it's going to pass between now and friday there was a lot of room for them to come up with something\nAnd you've seen the narrative shift oh the FBI investigation is in Folsom enough they haven't done enough um you've seen that happen but there's another component to this to\nThis is where I'm most concerned as to how I could see a vote failing or the Senate not having the votes one or the other\nAnd that is this notion now that the only way that we can come back from this brink of partisan a base\nIs if Kavanaugh becomes the sacrificial lamb if Kavanaugh is the one who has to get swept aside here so that we can bring the country back together you see so that we can heal the nation\nI Want to slap myself as I say that but\nCrushed me that resonates with people like flake Collins and Murkowski and you could see today some of them at least jockeying around this issue a little bit trying to position themselves for maximum political benefit around Trump\nOh how how could he so terrible making fun of the victim\nWasn't making fun of or he was really making fun of her testimony which is a different thing are there are people who could make fun to a great extent of Dr Ford you know people will say oh she's so credible she came across as very came across to me it's very strange in a little disturbed\nAnd you know the day off I'm hearing all these people that are going to the media and saying well well I was you know I had a sexual assault in my password I Know somebody who's actually saw the show I Believe Dr Ford dishes\nEthically him a ... completely untenable unacceptable position that will lead to monstrous outcomes something bad happened to me so I think that any time there's an allegation of that bad thing involving someone else I Believe that person or I Believe the allegations that's not\nThe system's supposed to work that's not the way moral judgment can be passed but this was a hysteria there was a frenzy here and it was fed so much by politics but also by the personalization of so much of this Kavanaugh versus Ford situation you notice the second\nThe second allegation from Ramirez and the third from sweat Nick ... they're barely even discussing that anymore\nJust ... you really can't make a case that somebody should be believe when that person isn't even sure that she knows what she's saying\nAs we found out with her near as and in the third case with sweat neck it's an intelligence test watch that interview with Julie sweat neck where she's talking about gang rape and being and in community college\nYou're hanging out with high school kids and all this stuff and and if you think that she's being truthful\nDon't buy any books with big words in them anytime soon I it's just the truth\nIf you think she's being truthful your your skills of discernment in analysis are ah are\nLacking to say the least but don't be fooled by what's happening with the damage here\nDon't be fooled for a second just because the narratives are collapsing just because now we can really come out now it's really safe out there to say hold on a second there is some big gap there is some whole there's women were lying are we to believe the second and third are lying and that's just a coincidence but the first is\nAnd we've been mixing of parties that seems to me to be\nJust as as brazen as it gets\nBut they're saying here that the information and he's six background investigations that have already happened\nThat's what has to come out now also note that blondes the Fords lawyers will not hand over her polygraph examination notes or her therapist notes until she gets to speak to the FBI [noise] here we go again why\nIs the wise blah Z for why does she require speaking the FBI she already gave her statement under penalty of perjury to the house the Senate Judiciary committee so why does she need to get the same she's going to give it ... if you give a different statement or the FBI\nThen she's lying and you've got a big problem that she's in criminal jeopardy so she's not going to give a different state in the FBI so what's with this only get the information the FBI oh that's right more excuse more complaint more delay\nWhich is the name of the game which is why flakes all thing I always found out since the late last friday was that we should have had the vote last friday in the lake is a moron that's what we found out that's all we found out so far there's that that the information that's come to light has just been\nFurther evidence that cabinet or should have gotten his vote last\nWeek when they plan to do it and this is not healing\nThe nation at all and I'm telling you they've got something else it's going to have tomorrow [noise] they're going to put something they're they're cooking something up behind the scenes I I I don't know exactly what it is but I think it's going to be about something unrelated to sexual assault now\nThey're going to say that Kavanaugh was an alcoholic or something like that just look at his ... and oh by the way he lied about being an alcoholic the proof is in the records that the public's not supposed to be able to see [noise] I'm\nRich Dennis when a gunman opened fire on law enforcement deer Florence South Carolina today killing a city police

allegations as well\nJust sat in his anger is triggered and what we saw today is someone who you can see attacking a one that it it's very frightening\nI don't know if these idiots all believe what they're saying or they're just saying what they think is going to get them the most to claim on the left but how do they think that somebody should react to being called a gang rape is with no evidence to having their their life ruined on national TV the reputation destroyed every well\nWhat are they really think you sit there and saying yeah you know I'm Sorry I just disagree with your assessment\nRemember that he gave an interview and the week where he was very measured very calm you know ... ... even ... the whole time on Fox and there were things that you know a guilty person I mean er an innocent person reaction speaking to\nSo that he goes in there and he's like well the fix is definitely in um at least going down fighting and gave an incredible performance and what really is is they're they're just they're just now\nActing like a bunch of spoiled brats 'cause they didn't get their way they thought they had and they thought after that after four testimony he was going to get his nomination was gonna get yanked and he came out there and he stole from them what they thought they had just with all their all their little schemes and their coordination behind the scenes the less media Democrats they all thought\nThey had it and then Kavanaugh's just said nope not yet not yet\nHis his temperament is bad he's been a judge for how long now it's been a ... he's been on the D.C court of appeals which is the second most important the second most important accord the country after the Supreme Court\nAnd its Bruce or my points out he kept his cool even though people were acting like complete savages during\nThe hearing I mean these protesters\nScreaming and acting like total maniac kept a school through all that you have to school through so much stuff doesn't get credit for any of that though there are there no one sitting around saying oh yeah you know he was really it was really cool about all that you know in any no of course of course not\nThe thing about cabinet as you've seen how not just the narrative but the way that the media covers these things is always damned if you do damned if you don't\nYou know Kavanaugh is to make and ... and a little too subtle with his responses he's guilty Kavanaugh's too angry Jew Jew a fire in his responses he's guilty as because they're not assessing their not judging anything they just have a they just wanted to not be on the Supreme Court\nAnd they know their audience and the case of the media doesn't wanted to be on the Supreme Court so they'll say whatever they have to say they will pander shamelessly an orderly\nHander with all this and\nNot what you see happening here you senator or a quarter and for his according not carbon Cornyn is a\nPointing out something that I think should get a little bit more attention which is that uh there is still zero evidence play five\n... expecting the FBI supplemental background investigation report it any time now and this is something that a number of senators wanted to see so we've been exhausted the attempts to try to ... or not or what Dr Ford has said and what others have said\nSo far uh we've got no cooperation Senator McConnell said
