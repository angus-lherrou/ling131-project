{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "That I've never heard of it has ... ... the pain is unbelievable how much are are you still over white then as an associate it with obesity\nWell or not but he only so people had I had him in high school and I didn't have 'em for Nineteen years and the only thing that happened after Nineteen years but I gave way and that's when I started again so I'm I'm trying not to open up that might be it\nYeah okay so what do you why now so I weigh about two sixty now okay and you lost forty pounds she said for what\nYou have about forty three pounds I'm and I'm Still going I'm Still doing going strong\nOkay okay good news is good for you well done have you yeah I mean with that kind of pain though you can learn to do a lot of different things that we found out there um so I you know 'cause I I'm I'm not only mildly curious about this um\nIn terms of bless your heart the pain you've got but uh the truth is is that the financial troubles are going to continue as long as you continue having a ten thousand dollar bill every three months right\nExactly and um I assume you've got health insurance I Do so when you have a kidney stone event what is your out of pocket cost between two and a six thousand dollars per yeah okay and what is your household income\nBy about sixty sixty sixty five eight\nYeah and so if your budget twelve thousand a year for medical on out of that it does make it hard to get some traction\nRight well especially with our credit card debt that were that we we we paid off twenty five thousand but we still have about thirty left so\nWe're we're making headway but you know the the hospital bills are going up at the same time\nYou know why I Would just give you permission to look less when this medical battle\nAnd not expect huge headway until you do yeah\nBecause you take sixty thousand miles twelve thousand you don't and then by the way you want to eat out of that too I'm a you're not going to make mega mega headway on this debt until you solve this medical problem but if you can stay even not going to hold or and or make some\nProgress while you solve this bigger issue then as soon as that's gone\nYou know you're going to be a new man in so many ways right\nSo I mean I I just cannot see this being something that you go oh twice a year I have a kidney stone for the next forty years I I just that that just is not a that's not a tenable scenario to me so I I think something is figure it out here along the way\nIn the process I I just can't ... maybe there are people that do that I don't know I've never heard of that but that doesn't mean that doesn't exist I'm not a medical professional by any stretch\nSo um but ... let's say that it takes two years to solve this and you know that's twenty four thousand dollars out of pocket that ...\nComing up you know well that's just going to be that's what you're fighting you know you just got this thing you're fighting in and it's going to slow down your progress it's not going to keep you from making progress but it's going to slow it down and just give yourself permission to do that and let's let's let's win the battle that you're fighting and that's the the battle for your health\nTo get your health back on Bush or wow ouch ow Brooke is with us in Tampa, Florida Hi Brooke how're you\nGuys have cable I but I said I already know the answer to that [laughter] [laughter] but I was actually calling I was wondering um I don't think you mentioned you know you were\nA lot of school and I had a crush it even more so I'm back Taiwan is an aspect that mhm like I'm twenty four I took a little bit of ... well he got aren't there yet but now that trade twenty four I'm getting like\nA lot more and grant side probably won't even have to look at them again until I have to be very I mean I can feel it\nBut I'm trying to work at like you know I Know yeah but you have any advice for time as you're like trying to about twenty four and trying to get like some of the Bob ... foot tall about their school and I want to try to have all that much of it and get\nA little while not school side yeah well\nThe first thing you do is your budget obviously your time today ... for your classes and a new budget your time for your study around your classes and in the new budget work I'm social comes after that I'm older than most people if they throw a brick\nThrough their television they found about thirty hours a week\nAnd um that's pretty amazing right there\nI mean people ask me how I read so many books a year I just don't watch a lot of TV anymore\nAnd I'm not mad about television I don't think the devil's in there although he probably is having a pretty good time there but um it's not like it's something like that it's not like a spiritual thing it's just a matter of what do I want to spend my time on that gives me my best life\nI spend my time on grandbabies children wife\nMe work reading\nOr do you know a long time before I spend my time so just being intentional with your time you'll be amazed how much time I mean you know how many ... you'd be amazed how many people spend two hours a day on Facebook\nAnd they talk about a colossal freaking waste of time there's one so um if you just stayed off social media completely or virtually ... almost completely and he turned off your TV you could make a pretty good living with that time\nThe second thing I Would do other than that is other than getting away from time wasters in budgeting my time is your best income production things at your age while in school when you need to control your time\nAre typically some kind of self employed or straight commission slashed self employed idea\nAt twenty four years old you can make more money nanny ing and babysitting\nYou make Fifteen twenty bucks an hour doing that\nYou can make more money cleaning people's houses you can make twenty five or thirty dollars an hour doing math and neither one of these things require extremes levels of skill\nI mean yes you obviously know something about children and it would be good if you had CPR at the Y. you taking the class and got certified and so All right but and you know those those sorts of things but you can make really good money hand control your time or book the times that you're with\nWhen do those things around your classroom time doing that so do away with the time oysters intentionally budget your time and look for self employed and or straight commission ideas where when you work you get paid very well and you control when you work\nAnd work a lot\nI was selling real estate in college now that's a very unusual college activity\nBut I grew up in a real estate household mom and dad owned a company when I was growing up so I got my real estate license three weeks after I turned Eighteen years old and I worked forty to sixty hours a week showing real estate but that means that worked every weekend but that's what a lot of real estate people do they worked Saturdays or Sundays showing houses they work in the evening showing houses and\nEvenings Saturdays or Sundays aren't usually when you do college so it worked out pretty good that's a kind of stuff I did so high math thank you for calling or British it you're joining this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nThis will knots of course include person born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United states but will include every other class of persons\nThat's right notch foreigners okay this is different than do people who are permanent residents or green card holders there are no longer foreigners they may not old citizenship but they're not consider foreigners for the purposes of this discussion\nBut it is very clear should be very clear that it was never the intention\nOf um the ... of the\nPeople who are drafting this of the senator back in Eighteen sixty six Jacob how for example who was who was talking about this amendment and there were dropping some and it was never there intention that this would extend to people who are in the United states illegally\nAnd now this is where we get into some complexity and some difficulty because for quite a while now it has been treated as such and this is where we get the anchor baby phenomenon right if you come into America and you have a child\nThe law has banned the way that the federal government has interpreted the laws that we have on the books is that you have a citizen now or you have citizenship\nSo if you come into America you have a child that child as a citizen this has led to some open it outright scams of the system most notably with the citizenship a or a birth tourism or citizenship are scams that are run\nAnd there have been all stories on this where in California in particular you have people from East Asia who will fly to California and stay in a a specific hotel and and the whole\nPurpose of this is that they're when they're you know nine months pregnant so that they give birth here that with a child that citizenship in this country and they can then go back to let's say mainland China or whatever and then when they want to go to college or they want to you know moved to the states when they're older they already have citizenship\nWell gee that's that's a pretty that's a pretty sweet deal isn't it but citizenship is not supposed to be a commodity that people can just sort of snatch for themselves whenever they want they're supposed to be more to it than that\nAnd we obviously can tell that it's a scam when people are showing up here and just having a child and then leaving\nBut oh but it's a citizen right oh but this person's a citizen and people say ... what about military what about um bachelor's abroad yeah they're on official government business and they're abroad on behalf of the United states so it's obvious that there should be and has been an exception for people under those circumstances\nI'm but illegal aliens\nThis by the way it goes right to the heart of of what the what the Democrats have been not just allowing but encouraging now for decades which is people violate our laws and then they benefit from that violation of law and they are a combination of emotional appeal and political pressure\nOverrides an actual plane interpretation of what the statutes are and it's unfair to the American people\nOur government is supposed to be putting our interests ahead of the interests of those in the rest of the world who just want to be here and that means enforcing what yes I understand on a philosophical level who's a citizen of what country who's born in ... in one country and that's all it's unfair\nBut life is unfair and nation states are inherently somewhat arbitrary system\nJust like the lines on a map that separate them are generally arbitrary yeah some of them have geographic boundaries but a lot of the time it's just okay well that's where the line that's where the line is and if there is no government enforcement of act on the line ceases to exist if there is no government enforcement\nOf laws around immigration than those laws in effect ceased to exist and then you keep working back from this and you find yourself saying whoa whoa whoa hold on a second here what your Democrats really what the Democrats really want and what do they believe the fourteenth\nAmendment says and and they clearly believe that and and ... it's not just believe rights also desire\nOr that anyone who comes to this country and has an anchor baby a we'll have that person to be a citizen because then that makes it a that makes it much much more likely\nThat later on that person will be able to sponsor oh that's right you get to sponsor family family reunification right\nSo if you if you come let's say from Honduras 'cause that's in the news a lot right now if you come from ... to the United states you were waiting to find out if you get asylum\nYou have a ... maybe a five year lag you have a baby in America but you're you're not in the country in any permanent status around the country even really legally you're going through a process to determine your legality if you\nHave that child\nIn America and then you go back to Honduras let's just say theoretically you could have family reunification migration a chain migration to bring interest the family in some oil revenues have one kid in America and you're already at the front of the line\nWhen it comes to the immigration system we have to think about the it's not just the incentive for that one child that's the incentive for the entire family\nNow you know that the uh what was it the uh I'm trying to remember the name of the group but I Do I can tell you the center for Immigration Studies there you go about a fifth\nOne in five and twenty fourteenth seven hundred and Ninety One thousand\nA birth in the United states were to in immigrants whether legal or illegal and illegal immigrants counted for seven point five percent which is almost three hundred thousand two and twenty four teams bleed the three hundred thousand illegal aliens had children in the United states\nBut it's not just a three hundred thousand or so remember that's a few years ago can be even higher now it's a three hundred thousand plus then they'll likely sponsoring of their entire family reunification oh but maybe it's even more complicated than that\nBecause once you've had that child in this country let's say that you are here legally and you've had a child now you have a citizen child you know the Democrats are going to say oh we can't separate families so forget about whether they can even sponsor the rest of the family for\nA for a legal immigration system ah forget about that right because now it's you have is just the politics and the emotional appeal\nOf oh\nOh hold on a second you already have a citizen I finished in Charlotte American citizen Trump of course we can't send you back of course you can't be deported hence the phenomenon of an anchor\nBaby right it it just naturally gaming the system not just for that individual who's obviously getting a benefit by his parents doing something that is a illegal right\nAcross the country is clearly it'd be being illegal aliens illegal Democrats may not want to believe it but it is true it is illegal you are in violation of law so they're getting a benefit but then they also get the additional benefit of\nOh wow if immigrations and Customs Enforcement later tried to deport the parents they're breaking up families Trump says he's gonna handles was an executive order is that the right way I mean probably not from a\nPerspective of separation of powers a constitution there are some\nDecisions although not particularly robust ones that look at the issue of who's a who's a a who's a citizen subject the jurisdiction there of and there were some complexities the nineteenth century around this because of Native Americans and whether Native Americans were subject to Native American jurisdiction not not us federal jurisdiction um\nUm by getting a lot of attention for it you know ... and and getting a lot of people that sit around and talk about it in and get free marketing I mean look ... visit to the White House Mike and we're trying to put a dollar figure on that what do we think that's worth that there was a marketing I mean clearly it's worth\nI Would argue it's worth tens of millions of dollars a free a free publicity absolutely like if if you were to pay a publicity for him to get you that level of attention in the national news media ... you're looking at at eight figure media by yeah I mean you'd have to be enormous and all he had to do is be like yeah I like Trump and ... and all this yet but\nThe next thing you know he's in the oval office yeah ... office right and\nYou know I I think that a lot of ... I mean look I Know I expected a lot of us did but the good news is I wasn't sitting around with Conyers changing the conversation like no you're not changing the conversation I mean he's changing the conversations that it's about ...\nBut that's not something that I think we all need to sit around and celebrate I mean you know good good for him a but I I never thought that he was a ... a reliable ally for conservatism so this is not\nThis does not surprise me I I Do I look I if I went back and was the shows I Know that said I don't think everyone needs to bash the guy he should be allowed to you know should be allowed to approach trumpet say these things I don't think he's that crazy and they did\nGet some uh they did get some\nPeople out of prison and you know there there were some good stuff that was done here I can I can say that the conversation I think the conversation Trump Tanya was interesting just won a spectacle but two there were some points made that were worthwhile\nBut you know look this is why conservatives and we we always seem to remember this we have heroic ideas and ideals because you're not really have heroes [noise]\n\nPresident Trump drawing criticism for Charlie asks us on HBO we could end birthright citizenship for the U.S through an executive\nOrder is ridiculous it's ridiculous and it has to and house speaker\nPaul Ryan telling W. B. okay radio birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment you\nObviously cannot do that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order\nCritics say the right of citizenship for immigrant children born in the country is constitutionally protected and played the president is using the issue to stir up Republican voters ahead of next week's mid term elections\nPresident Trump and first lady millennia visited Pittsburgh hospitals treating victims of last week's synagogue shooting that left eleven dead earlier they visited the synagogue and makeshift memorial to the victims several hundred protesters also turned out demonstrating against\nThe president's visit this is Fox News [noise]\nEither did vote yes suntan this November six and ease the burden on California renters\nSo here's the story that may sound familiar I used to post to several job boards only to be overwhelmed with tons of the wrong resumes and because there were so many residents never stopped to separate the great candidates from those who are at the fast track I mean it's not easy to find the right person for my wineries my sports medicine because\nI Love NPR agencies that old process was definitely not fired\nBecause I was a closet smoker so I was always hiding or trying to find a place to do it when somebody is Melanie afterwards it really sort of control my entire down\nI switched to Joel because my boss recommended that\nI went to a store and I talked to one of the house rats there and there were lots of options but he really felt like to join us the best thing for me it just feels really great to get into a car that doesn't smell like smoke\nGet out of my close at the end of the day and not snow snow [noise]\nI Would tell anybody who's even considering to try to Joel\nJoel is the vapor alternative that delivers nicotine satisfaction without the mess of cigarette ash borer lingering order make the switch today that joy dot com that's J.

Andrew Gillum is an example of somebody who I\nI don't know how you can think he's a good idea for the state of Florida I mean I we played it on this show and the ... election I think is probably going to get more national attention than any other election and his mentor\nBut give them the guy who a lot of people focused on obviously he's a young telegenic African American and you know so and and the state of Florida politically\nIs a kind of Lynch Penn State for anybody in twenty twenty and that's why you know when you when you look at this and you try and assess\nConversation around this race you've got to remember that it's not just even about this it's about how it sets up the the future uh for the Democratic party\nAnd you know there's going to give them though we've we've talked ... or we've talked about before on the show doesn't know how we pay for some of these programs doesn't know how he would uh actually improve health care is really what it comes down to is a lot of these politicians they they talk of the game about how they're going to get more health care to people really ... they're gonna raise taxes\nExpand Medicaid that's all it's going to be raised taxes expand Medicaid and Medicaid\nHealth outcomes are really poor and you're not going to get better health care outcomes just by having more state dollars thrown into programs you know we we've seen this with schools\nYou can spend a lot of money on schools and have them be bad you can spend a whole lot more ... a lot less money on schools and have them be good but the lid answer is always just more money for schools that's more money more money\nAnd when you look and pull it apart you actually get into the nuts and bolts of what's happening in our education system\nWhat'd you see is the money isn't going to the kids it's not even one of the teachers going through these bureaucrats administrators\nThe teaching system what do you thing happens with the state state paid for medical systems a tremendous amount of waste and abuse so I mean Gillum it's just a bad idea but he wants to get a sense he's kind of a it's kind of a nasty guy\nUm you know he's very very willing to uh say whatever he thinks he has to say about the opposition which I guess it's true of all Democrats these days but it play fourteen\nAnd most of the fact is is the given too much harbor or to racism is enough votes\nAnti Semite side he himself when he became the Republican nominee went on Fox News said to the voters of Florida not the monkey the state of price race has been an issue from the very beginning and the campaign that because I introduced is having my grandmother used to have the same [noise]\nThat because you're both get dirty but he actually like\nOffensive is from what to do was to drag me into the gutter yeah for the right because they can survive getting dirty I Can't survive\nNow let me just take a moment and then back with you and just admire what would happen there\nThat is a rhetorical technique known as predator rich CEO\nVeteran CEO is I could talk about how my opponent is a complete moron who would be nowhere without his family money but I'm not going to do that it is doing the thing that you say you will not do as a form of attack and a\nThen they pay in this is nonsense\nPeople will say there was like oh they ... they'll they'll they'll be paying taxes to really\nA vast majority of of people who are earning what illegal aliens earn are going to over the course of their lifetime take much more in government benefits and they pay in taxes even close\nSo how does this make us wealthier better off of the country by the way we're always hearing about how divided we are as a nation oh we're so divided\nOkay how is it supposed to make us less divided to bring people into this country or allow them to come into the country and stay who do not speak the language who do not share our culture and whose first by definition first act on us soil is to break the law\nThat is going to bring us together that has some\nUnifying effect that are up to this point the most of us have been on aware of that I that that strikes me as very strange that strikes me as very unlikely\n\nBut they've been lying to us about this for a long long time there are many many people who have a vested interest in\nPropagating this lie even further and propping it up\nOh Schmidt by the way is not is not done with the big fat you're stupid thing that each day very still ... keep playing it\nKellyanne Conway ... today goes on national television and she said well this shooter's motives were because there's an anti religious sentiment no man\nThe propaganda industry that shape commands with the violence president that she serves a vetted by mark ... van and Rush Limbaugh\nAnd Breitbart News pastors and judicial watch and all the rest of them have blood on their hands for the insight mats that they have made that have triggered an radicalized these crazy people it is delivered in in ... he said\nDo love the writer and a lot of interest guys aggressively aggressively stupid and the fact that he was in charge of the McCain presidential campaign at any level tells you really all you need to know but why McCain's campaign was due to he also was the one I think the thought that Sarah Palin as the VP was a great idea great idea writer who is part of that whole process\nSo but it but to the to the main point here\nClaiming that Breitbart and ... a rash and live in and others have blood on their hands is just is just a a a smear\nIt's just slanderous\nIt has no basis in any reality especially because the first of all really he's he's going to go out he's going to go after ... after ... after an anti Semitic shooting in a synagogue these complete buffoon on MSNBC speaking about propaganda that's out there he's going to go after Merkel event\n\nWow I mean it showed brazen that there I just can't figure out is she too stupid to know the full scope of what he's saying or is he in fact just that cynical that he doesn't care\nAnd that MSNBC put this on their air and allows us to continue by the way I'm sure there were other segments of the right before right after this about how we need to restore civility in our conversation after they got this guy\nThe guy got blood on time for a thing the thing about the same stage but with the now with the who\nWe look marked within doesn't need me to catch his back but I I got to say you know that it's just it's just an outrage somebody would set of them are at war or about rush or any of total outrage\nBy MSNBC is maybe that's why I don't spend as much time on that because MSNBC is almost in terms of stupidity well it's more honest about being a bunch of left is it's really beneath contempt uh it it really is that a level where it's not worth analyzing it because you only watch that if you really believe\nThat history does not matter that capitalism is not a good thing that a math is not an essential elements of good policy making ... ... that's the only way you can watch MSNBC\nAnd that everybody should climate there are a victim and just fight over who's a bigger victim and that that's a recipe for healthy society that's the basis of the MSNBC watchers mind\nMan\nIt is it has been rough watching all these people just make complete in Brussels with themselves just\nOutrageous stuff\nThen turn around and want to be taken seriously and other things\nOh wait wait since we're talking about the dumbest people on TV let's just throw in one one more one more out there who is a quotes\nConservative oh you know it was coming\nThe less favorite all I Do is jump on the right person that is allegedly on the right Jennifer Rubin who you know I I just before we before we get to her her little part of this\nOne of my favorite things that I have a red in in a long time was my friend Charles Cooke who's a brilliant writer and I I Wish we saw and heard more from Charles these days I think he's just enjoying life in Florida but I've always really liked Charles and thought he was very talented\nOr what Charles did this piece that was comparing what Jennifer Rubin writes one year and then write the next year and it's like a person with schizophrenia fighting with herself in writing all the time\nLike this is a really good idea for it was just terrible for Israel this was a really good thing for concern for conservative\nOr there's no consistency your principal whatsoever but you're Ruben sure enough he's an opening to trash Trump ready Semitism shoes take it to play Fifteen\nWho does not believe he is president the entire country does not believe that people respond to ... they got out there talking about his tax plan out there talking about the slave trade L O L O L\nI don't have to bear and leaving the bloody shirt and that's why we got our our\n... you know guys we hit the edge ...

patriot donnelley's preempted due to sports programming Kiki id will resume streaming audio at the conclusion of the game\nAnd it's it's really quite frightening\nSarah are you this is a this is a part of the discussion that I think always somehow gets a either pushed aside because the politics or maybe there's just some some on his views on the part of those who are trying to get a handle on this epidemic\nBut we always hear that it's the person it's prescription drugs that are pushing this epidemic for what you're telling me\n... it's it's really that these are similar to prescription drugs but there are being obtained\nIllegally and being made illegally\nSo ... is is that an accurate reader of what's going on here because it is being made invests in Mexico it's obviously they're not being filtered through Pfizer and then sold via legitimate pharmacies to people in the streets this is just cutting out visor as if from the picture and or any drug company entirely from is\nAbsolutely so we know that there was a problem and we know that there was a problem with the pharmaceutical companies and that's been very public and that you know the dangers of you know over prescribing a opioids to patients even when you're going in for a debt tool\nFor dental work there was over prescription of opioids um we saw a rise in that not only with veterans but with ... with people across the board in the United states when when the escalation of addiction\nRates started sky rocketing but what what happened was as soon as those issues began to be regulated and of course the federal government stepped in Dr stopped over prescribing for the most part\nOne of the things that happened was the drug cartels said wow look at this we can potentially be making billions off of this and that's exactly what they're doing and not just the drug cartels\nBut China China is also a cooperative this with that and all and I think we've been hearing a lot about that at least a little bit more in the news media\nAnd what they've done is they have created their own pills their own pharmacies and and they made him look like the actual pills so some of the markings I was actually in Ohio talking to some of the undercover da ... officers that are working there and some of the local law enforcement who work with the DEA\nThey said look these pills are almost identical you look at a Xanax it looks like a Xanax that would be made by a a a pharmaceutical company but it's not it's not a real ... it's not a real Percocet it's not a real actually caught\nEither way taking notes for recreational use is dangerous it's addictive it ends to lives lost\nBut when you see it come talented with enormous amount of narcotics that are being spilled into our streets this poison\nAnd I'd sure buck you you hear about this all the time but setting all it's so dangerous that in its pure form\nWhich has moved across the United states many times in its pure form could literally cause someone to overdose in die by just touching it and in the documentary it's explained very well that only for grant for little grains like four little grains of table salt of that no could literally kill a grown man\nAnd we've seen loads of this stuff come into the United states for example\nIn April this year in Nebraska on state troopers they seized over a hundred and Eighteen pounds of that and all\nAnd authority said this is enough to kill twenty six million people\nWhen we showcased are ... and premier the movie here in Washington DC and then showcased in Ohio which was which is really the epicenter we use Ohio as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country when we showcased it they're one of the head of the DEA Mario Jimenez\nCame and talked to the audience you know the full house because Ohio is really struggling with addiction rate and he said look if I close up this theater right now and they released a small package of setting all through the air systems\nWe would all be dead\nHe said so this is no longer just about addiction this is about saving our children's lives\nRealizing that this is a potential national security threat really understanding where this is coming from and not being ashamed not being ashamed about addiction we have to come out you have to talk to our kids\nWe have to let them know without on the street\nWe have to be open and honest with one another if we're ever going to find a solution and I'm not saying we're going to find a solution to stopping addiction we have to stop this before something potentially so dangerous habits before we lose a generation of our kids and we have to face it and we have to be honest about it\nServed this this documentary tacos what is the biggest health crisis in the United states are more people are dying from this than died from the height of the AIDS epidemic or the crack epidemic in this country when when you speak to these families obviously\nGoing to be very and people that have been affected by this in any respect 'cause it's very emotional and and it's it's haunting for people there's clearly now a greater awareness of it than ever before what what is the answer what can we do about this\nI think first of all people have to find their lane everybody in ... in an all parts of the ... our communities need to find out what they can do what's their role as a parent it's educating your child\nAs a health care provider it's understanding what's going on and be able to be aware of of the potential dangers out there and assessing those right away so we can save lives\nAnd as people we have to realize you have a problem with addiction we also have to have the right resources appropriated the right way so that when the federal government puts money\nAside for this epidemic that\nThere's accountability for it that this money isn't being funneled through the federal system through state and local agencies and and just disappearing into the bass array of our of our\nOf our money pet but that it's actually working and that we support our law enforcement and our federal law enforcement I Believe that as this as we start looking at this on a broader scale especially with the threat of setting all [noise]\nEspecially with the threat of the drug cartels and now they're pouring this poison into our system and into our children's life we call it not in Dane B. E. I. N. not in pain\nThe drug cartels are using the veins of our highways to infiltrate and move their contraband into the United states and that and you are people's gains and into our children's games and we have to find a way to stop this we have to work with our southern partners with Mexico\nWith Colombia with Guatemala with Nicaragua with El Salvador we have to insist that they do their part and honestly there were a few people in the documentary that brought up some great ideas you know look this is not just a criminal organization this has now become a transnational terrorist\nReligious and here the limitations of their women so to speak or here's what he here's what\nLindsey says about this liquid to\nThe American people have had it with this I've had it with it\nCab and all of a caravan blaming transfer everything under the sides if you want to change the way the country is going and you want to tell these people they got it wrong\nThen vote a week from tomorrow for the Republican Party the only way they're going to change his for them to lose ... cabin are the main anything and if you don't want any more Kavanaugh\nCharacter assassinations are then you need to reject what they did and hand them that the state they deserve they want power so badly the media is and the tank for them and the only way they'll get it as for the American thankful to send a loud and clear signal that we're tired of you tired of their tax they blaming every Republican for everything\nI think this is an essential element of the Trump movement it really is it really is a strategy winning and winning and winning really is a political strategy and I know that that sounds ridiculous because it has not always the strategy no in fact Republicans for a long time we're happy to lose as long as they last like gentleman\nBut that obviously didn't get the left to act more gentle men lead just got the left who say oh great we're winning screw the other guys\nTrump comes in and says okay it's not going to be perfect is not going to be\nPretty but if we want them to change we've gotta when Lindsey Graham is saying that you and you know what Lindsey Graham two point oh he's correct [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nUm ... the chief of Indonesia armed forces says the possible location of the fuselage shuttle crashed lion air jets been identified President Trump tells actually she's preparing an executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S to non citizens\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan tells Kentucky radio station W.
