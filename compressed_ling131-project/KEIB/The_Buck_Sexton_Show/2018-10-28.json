get health insurance through their employer\n'em and using round numbers it's roughly fourteen hundred dollars a year so if I ... my\nDependence and myself the premiums would be nine hundred versus including her which would be Eighteen hundred on top of that fourteen hundred dollar surcharge anyway\nSo she's nine hundred extra month plus an additional fourteen hundred dollar surcharge a year correct so she's ten eight a lemonade twelve twelve thousand something a year\nFor health coverage through your existing employer ... how much is it for her if she goes on her employer's plan\nThe eleven hundred a year\nEleven hundred a year versus twelve thousand a year\nOr a versus on twelve hundred additional on top of that for the family and um then I say to that if we take\nOur ... plans that they're both high deductible plans on line three thousand dollars but the company and set of eyes the employees are two thousand that's leading roughly a thousand dollar to cover for that'd be ...\nOr ... or the hers is five thousand but it would cover one hundred percent once that's met so it was the main question will still keep the whole family under one bucket or should we each take our

be things you really haven't thought of or through\nBecause just because you're temporarily incapacitated the question would then become more what are your chances for recovery and all that and you decide now I've sat with people doing these forums\nAmazon wants to take some of the market share that disappeared from Toys R us this the vanishing and they want a piece of that pie so you're going

what we can Gail ... invest the money and and we want to be able to help them when we feel like they're ready for it at like ... or their first town or starting a family farm layer sick as young\nRight so first of all I just did the math you have brilliant family planning\nFor cars you built in babysitter is right there [laughter] the last six years apart each kid and it's pretty good there [laughter]\nSo if the money's not for school it gets a little more complicated [noise] so how much money are you thinking of for each child\nWho was like ...\nI was like well I don't know very open like ... like ... ...\nSo you got a Thirteen year old you would want to have that money at what age\nI'm ... years by hand\nTen years from now [noise] okay so I'm going to give you some crazy suggestions okay\nOklahoma you're ready for crazy I'm Ronnie\nBecause I'm always nervous about putting money in a kid's name because as precious as our kids are when they're young we don't know exactly how mature they're going to be and responsible once legally they have access to money\nSo now is a Thirteen year old Seventy year old and one is going to be one soon you are in a position now with custodial accounts you get to make all decisions\nBut once they she was considered to be adulthood which is actually often before kids mature enough to make good decisions with money if they find out the money's there they have the ability to take control of it and spend it on things that you've worked hard to save you might not be able to control\nSo why you're ready for my weird suggestion I recommend wall right you've heard me talk about Ross IRAs and found is that something that you and your husband do\nWe go out right now on the lookout we didn't have any any on that at large and small business owners and keep that in that lay right and like it now or point where um you know I Can't go there for a house get clay and pay for and ...\nAll right so let me tell you the beauty of using the Ross is a way to save for your kids\nYou control it now and in the future and everything the accounts earn they earned tax free so your intention is to give a decent amount of money to each of your children are sounds like and maybe mid twenties\nLead over a lot right ball um well I feel like they're ready for it\nRight so you maintain a hundred percent control if you and your husband each fund Ross\nUp to age fifty or each allowed to put in up to fifty five hundred dollars a year into these after age fifty sixty five hundred each the way you can ... soccer away enough money over these years moving forward that you can fully put money aside they will meet\nWhat your goal our goals are for these three kids but see here's the beauty\nYou can only give them what you've contributed to at the earnings stay behind with you\nAnd stay there all do now till you would\nThe money in retirement so it becomes like a partial retirement account for you with completely tax free growth you maintain complete control the money\nAnd when you're ready for them to have the money you've contributed on their behalf you can give it to your Thirteen year old ten or so years from now and have it be a completely tax free event\nIf you don't think you're a Thirteen year olds mature enough at that point and you want to wait a couple more years you wait a couple more years but you completely are in charge because it's your account your money\nSo the loop hole with a raw\nIs the money that is earning a Ross has to be left to side ... year fifty nine and a half or older but the money you contribute to the raw you're free to use for any purpose at any time\nSoon you well know I'm gonna let him a lot we are focused\nOn if you work on ... dot com I have a very simple guide for you to set up a rock and you'll know exactly what to do math to use with us on the Clark Howard\nShow Hi Matthew ... great thank you you got a question for me about the stock market\nA yes or so I'm a college student and I had taken out some money from much alone let subsidized loans\nAnd places like Mark it into a some well known stocks and um I was wanting to use that money to um I guess have access to the dividends\nTo those games and so I Want to know what your thoughts on uh is is too risky um you know for a college student and and I would I Would there be a better place or for that money but to me\nSo you have the ability to borrow a under the federally subsidized loan program where there is no interest paid until six months after you graduate interest starts right that's correct so\nThis is free money the the question I Would ask you if we had a ... a tough spot in the stock market you've put this money and the stocks that you borrowed\nAre you prepared to deal with the consequences if that money is not there when you're out of school and you've got to pay it back\nIf there were people who were depositing and one account\nAnd then going to cash that same checks somewhere else\nAnd sticking losses through the banking system will now there's new guidance issued by the Federal Reserve who get stuck with the law is the second time somebody presents a check it's not who wrote the check\nIs not the second financial institution you go to to posit the check is the one that you deposit check with electronically according to kept minors\nSo there's a new federal procedure guidelines issued\nOn who will be liable in the future based on what you're required to do to not be surprised\nIf in the next few weeks you get a notification from your bank credit union brokerage whoever it is you do electronic deposit when there will be a phrase they require\nThat you write on the face that check you're going to deposit\nAnd that will be something white for mobile deposit only or something of similar wording that the bank is requiring and that is\nWhat you'll have to put on both for your deposit will be accepted the idea being that will lemonade you trying to deposit fat check a second time somewhere else who knew people would try to run a game like that anyway [noise]\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n\n\nFox News I might the odds of President

make\nA big push coming out of Washington [noise]\nTo require drug manufacturers in these crazy TV ads they do for\nDrugs to disclose in the ads what a prescription actually cost for the drugs\nAnd the pharmaceutical companies are going crazy like what in the world are you thinking why would we ever want to tell anybody\nThat those beautiful models running through the beautiful setting with the backdrop of magnificent mountains are lakes or oceans or whatever they're smiling year to year well their commentator says\nMay cause your right arm to fall off or may cause you to have really sad suicidal thoughts or whatever\nDavid Lazarus or the Los Angeles times\nHas written recently about the proposal from Washington vet pharmaceutical companies post prices and what's your perspective on this\nAbout having to disclose that those smiling people are taking a drug that would cost you two thousand dollars a month or whatever\nWell first cargo let's get a little credit to the president for at least lighting drug prices as something that he's concerned about and indeed since the campaign he has repeatedly return to this and even the drug companies are getting away with murder when it comes to things but that\nSaid he has offered no significant maneuver or rule whatsoever to lean in drug pricing and what we got out of the administration last week was simply a proposal that along with all those crazy side effects that get listed what we see ads for prescription Mets on TV [laughter]\nDrug company also has to include the list price of the drug in the intent here with the ministry she says is to shame of the companies to bring these prices down because so many of these places are in fact\nIndefensible oh there's a bunch of problems to this first of all what price would they put it in the list price which nobody have the actual price of the wholesale price that clear but the bigger problem is the drug industry to look at that said we don't think\nSo and then they turned out the first amendment and said you can't compel us to say things we don't want and I put out so called to some constitutional lawyers to say what was that true I mean they've got a list all the side effects cat they also be forced to list the price\nAnd the lawyer said you know it looks like you can make a case from the government's\nPoint of view to Cold War speech if they were the public interest or public health or safety involved and that's why you do get the requirement for side effects but it would be very difficult for the government to argue that there is a public interest in simply shaming these guys with the scarlet letter of having to publicize their\nPrices and so the lawyers are saying you know what the drug industry is going to take this all the way to the Supreme Court where they will probably aware Citizens United environment where the oil\nBusiness has never had more rights and more power and the upshot of this is first of all this is a fight there for the government is the way to win and second of all if the drug industry has forced to litigate yes what they'll just pass those costs on us\nAll right so let's go to the core or something and this is something I've heard from several doctors that this is very frustrating to them with the with the ads for these pharmaceuticals on TV because they all have patients come in and they're already pre sold doc\nI Want you to write me a script for blah blah blah because I saw that it's going to do all these miraculous things and suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and addition to curing white males me and so the perspective I've gotten from physicians is that we're the ...\nProblem more than anything else in that we're allowing ourselves to be to influence by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point\nIn the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic Haitian in healthcare terms which means they've got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no
