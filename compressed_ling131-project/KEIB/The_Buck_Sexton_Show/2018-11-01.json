so it looks like you've got a about a million in mutual funds right right okay very cool how old are you\n[noise] sixty three this week\nCongratulations happy birthday something how much of this one point four million is there because you inherited money\nWell claim forty my mother left me forty thousand\nSo you're not a millionaire because of inheritance no no [laughter] I Love it\nAnd Paul do you remember your worst income year and your best income year\n... year I'll start with the the 'cause I was the most recent that was the last year before I retired I was at a hundred and Ninety thousand okay I'm In the ... the worst was completely on the other end of the ... and those are\nAll say the year before I went in the air force I think I made about a thousand\nOkay and and looking at that what you what was your career before you retired\nI was a a sports specialist for a fortune one hundred company\nOkay and did you attend college not OK and\nLook at it as did you use any debt outside of a mortgage to help you reach millionaire status\nOkay and as a household do you do any giving up early what kind of giving do you do\nSpecifically at its were tied in with a charitable groups and sometimes it's a mix of cash but sometimes it's ... it's a a actual the effort or work where you\nAre right and so um what advice would you give to the twenty five year old version of use is listening right now Ken this still be done and if so what do you do to get there\nI Would definitely can be done I retired I I just for whatever reason I may want to pick up the boxers work to do everywhere\nAnd what I say to anybody today is um are all I'll be afraid to work show up on time but uh most importantly what worked for me I didn't have the paper as I always called I didn't have the the shoot 'em ups are kind of been fear that but what I did instead as I look for opportunities\nSo when the door open I put my foot in it um and and that's the way I kind of scratch and called and got my way round two thousand two hundred and Eighteen dollars with\nHow old were you when you started investing in mutual funds\nI was a twenty seven years old what made you do that\n[laughter] [noise] and that was the year I think I heard you mentioned this on the ... the show a ... sharks went on sale mhm ...\nAnd our company at the time we started doing the matching fund and I just thought it was a no brainer to at least capture the seven percent that we're not you know the whole the couple of years later I looked at it I had tens of thousands of dollars all of a sudden we were kind of cool\n[laughter] that's a nice thing to wake up to brother a congratulations very proud of you sir very well done interesting mix to a day old they are only two college graduates out of the whole bunch today that's exactly right\nMost of the millionaires we studied in the millionaire study from your book the everyday millionaires did graduate from college last of them did not graduate from prestige colleges throwing Seventy three percent I Believe it wasn't didn't not graduate from a prestigious college went to a state school but most of them did have a four year to great today\nOn the today show most of them did not that's right\nI mean a a couple of associate's degrees and a couple of a high school graduates one with a GED at age thirty\nYeah it's amazing uh Dave at the age is that we're looking at we got from forty three fifty sixty fifty seven forty eight to sixty three\nThat was today yeah all day you know so average age we found in the study was fifty to two years old you know that the average of all of them that's right of the ten thousand that we talk to\nBut they're amazing thing is as we got also two to three of them started investing in their twenties so they got that first job got intentional early\nThey recognize the match that's right orange scared of the mutual funds and were scared of the stock market as a matter of fact Paul was the opposite he jumped in when the market was down that's where I figured out hey that's down this time to get in well\nBecause he he had listened to you explain that it's on\nSale and now he hadn't back then [laughter] he said that's that's the way it sounds to me I Want to have that right yeah\nYou know the other one we had the one lady bed learn what not to do from watching their parents who ended up having to go down the path of bankruptcy and so this wisdom Dave this awareness this gaining the right kinds of information used in the right tools that are out there for one k.'s and for what three bees\nSo typical millionaires not a crook no they're not an athlete no they're not an artist they're not an actor they hear it a ton of money didn't inherit their money and the typical millionaire does not have a four point oh GPA\nIn other words there every day people people yeah in plain sight that's right and uh they just made the decision it was their actions that created it not some in eight lightning strike\nOr a you know a lightning in a bottle somehow they said oh you got to be Brad Paisley Peyton Manning to be a millionaire not true matter of fact a famous millionaires are less than one percent of the millionaires\nAre that are out there um and show that you know the words you don't have to be rich and famous so you know when we hear people say the only way out of my neighborhood is\nA a basketball it that's not true that's right\nIt is a way out right but it's not the only way out as a matter of fact it's not the typical way out if you want to be a typical everyday millionaire and that kind of comes down to what kind of laser I said in a new quarter enough because we both just fell in love with a lady but they're saying it doesn't matter where you come from it matters where you're going that's right\nAnd you make the decision to do these for one case stay out of debt live on less than you may and several of them today talked about work ethic\nYeah I mean I'm sitting here thinking about Carlos who was with KFC for over forty years one job starting out washing dishes days one company no one comedy washing dishes so here he is with us back of this is the problem in their ... and having no idea his work ethic\nInto say uh okay okay you need you need to take a breath and not say such ridiculous stuff on air\n\nBut I treated out without article those you're on Twitter concede check this out I I I ... in response to her\nCompletely insane statement on air which he did that have to back down from and apologize 'cause it was so dumb that was indefensible but but in response to that I said this is not even the dumbest thing that you will see or hear on CNN all week\n... not even this week will that be the single motion 'cause we've got an election coming up next week ... people are going to try to out to one another on the left with stupid hyperbolic destructive nasty\nComments I said it wasn't the dumbest thing this week and I present to you to prove me correct none other\nThan Mr Don Lemon play Clipper too\nI keep trying to point out people not to demonize any one group for any one ethnicity but we keep thinking that the biggest terror threat of something else some ... some people who are marching you know towards the border like a feminine and when the last time they did this a couple of hundred people came and they you know\nMost of them to get into the country most of them tired you know got stuck it out before they even made it to the border um\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terrorist threat in this country if white men most of them radicalized for up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere is no ban on you know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy band so what do we do about that\nThat's right folks multimillionaire CNN anchor says we need to stop demonizing people Hama and understand that white men on the right or the real threat there is a real evil the real monsters maybe we should ban them from traveling\nI didn't make him saying I'm not taking his words out of context I'm just playing for you what he said on national TV and you can say about why there's so much for a while either you're focusing on this and come up no\nNo no he is representative of the overall mindset on the left that's why we did the montage this this vicious what these people this is what the other side's a laugh the Democrats what they think\nThey really believe that they're not the problem at all when it comes to nasty overheated dangerous rhetoric the other side is the problem\nDot dot dot because of the other side's a bunch of evil racist Nazi biggest Gina fold you know ... ... vehicles with blood on their hands\nOh\nI see that that is\nAt the heart of why we're having such a a descent into political madness in this country they don't even have the self awareness that don't even have the ... the the the honesty\nTo be able to understand that you are not going to improve the temperature\nOf political rhetoric if in fact your go to position is that the political rhetoric is bad because the other side is basically Hitler\nAnd I wasn't exactly how many how many references to rights and you know the rights stacked fires and not season or did you hear that opening montage\nThis is how they think about the other side and you know what it you know what it really drives a lot of this\nIs a success or the successes that Trump has and the relative failures of the eight years of Obama's and before it\nOr that they told us they being all the opponents to the Trump movement they told us that he would fail miserably that he was completely in over his head that he had no idea what he was doing\nAnd that we would all essentially they will be able to laugh at us as we all suffered the horrible consequences\nOf having Donald Trump as president\nBut you see we have suffered the consequences of Donald Trump as president and it's suffering with things such as the lowest unemployment rate in sixty years the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment rates of all time a booming economy a\nTon of investment no massive foreign wars getting started no crazy foreign military interventions that are going to send our bravest and best Americans into harm's way for missions that the powers that be already been clear on how they're supposed to end and what's supposed to happen\nThat's that's\nThose are the consequences of Trump ism and now that we've\nFelt that for two years now that we've seen it for ourselves there's a desperation on the left what does it say about the judgment of\nSome of the most celebrated names in the Democrat Party whether it's politicians or pundits or anybody with real power in ... what does it say that they have been wrong wrong wrong\nAll they can do is criticized Trump's words his persona his attitude is tone\nA but they're not able to say oh look at this issue of look at this major policy issue where we're from either lied to his lied to his supporters lied to his base\nOr failed miserably no quite the opposite they they hate Trump more because he is successful they hate Trump more\nBecause he is by his ability to withstand them and succeed despite all of their efforts he's in a front to the left very sense of self\nHe makes them feel insecure about their beliefs and on the left belief and politics are tied together\nIn such a way that the true believers the left wing zealots don't know who they are if they do not have their progressive virtue signaling they don't know who they are if\nThey can't believe that CNN is objective and the New York times isn't liberal and you know all the smart people all the good people vote Democrat\nIt rattles them in a way that people that view politics really just as a as a system for managing conflict in a in a civil society which is what I think conservatives that have a good perspective on this understand it to be a don't feel as\nShaken up right we see this is okay\nWhat are we getting how's it going what are the results we try to take a rational approach to it and and even if someone just passionate although I Can't say that's always the case\nI Do like it when Trump owns the lives I find it very amusing I think it's very necessary to I think the media in this country will never be the same and that's a good thing I think the days of believing\nThat there is an objective neutral press that as the the center of our our media apparatus that's never coming back that's gone now we now it's\nIs how they do it though is how the left\nEngages in his manipulation of reality and they really just water to make this even ... a more divisive moment make it even more difficult for the president of the United states to be able to do his job here which is to try and help inhale the American people by turning this into some\nYou know bash Trump session\nThese people are a disgrace and you don't really comes down to they don't believe that he's the president\nThey just they they don't accept it not my\nMy primary you remember that the chance on the streets they think that he's not just not their president but he is not the president period\nUnfortunately they are wrong but they're delusional enough that they think it doesn't matter uh they should be ashamed but as we see\nProgressive or on cable ashamed these days\n... President Trump says he'll deployed up to Fifteen thousand troops to the U.S Mexico border to stop a group of Central American migrants seeking asylum\nDefense secretary Jim Mattis rejecting claims that deployment is a political stunt we don't we don't do stunts and this department critics say the president's who's using scare tactics to drum up support for Republicans ahead of Tuesday's midterm

line for America bug that is that [noise]\nSome lines list in the freedom of team less get to Charlie in Maryland hello sir\nThank you for taking my call like I Know you're going to get on the subject of is a burst right deal and if people are informed of the fourteenth conch constitutional amendment it has nothing to do with illegal ... yep\nOh I'm In it that in depth coming up later on the show but just I guess that's kind of a U.S kind of a preview of the courts have never held that that is that\nThat is the case that illegal aliens no court has held illegal aliens\nOr should be given citizenship it's never been addressed by the courts before and when you really think about it that was clearly not the intent of those who wrote the amendment at Eighteen sixty six and why would that be the decision of the government now it makes no sense\nTo consider people who are foreign citizens means there is of a foreign country who are not legally in this country who are supposed to be removed from this country as soon as they come into contact with law enforcement and our government apparatus\nThat their children should be automatic or their children born here should be automatic citizens and it doesn't make sense why would we do that\nIt doesn't make any sense it was formed to give the birthright to this age children of slate\nWith the more the fourteenth amendment was well as for it was for yet that the descendants of of slaves after the civil war was one and it was very explicitly for that purpose and it also at all not this later on it when you look at the way it didn't deal with Native American populations at the time and you know there's a lot of\nLegal ease here about the different jurisdictions and overlapping jurisdiction but\nIt should be clear it's pretty amazing really that we'd gone this far without anyone challenging it and I I think Trump is absolutely right if nothing else we should have clarity on the issue I mean we should at least have the court's wing in and explaining and and I think that the problem here Charlie is with the Democrats don't really understand\nIs that no matter what once again they are showing their chipping their their hand here and we're seeing the Democrats are in favor of\nIllegal immigration illegal aliens being in this country or are they always take the side of illegals in every issue on every issue and Americans take notice of this\nI think I think our president is slamming it in their face and\nYeah he has every right to do that yeah\nI think he's I think he's making the I think he's making them the right move on that so thank you very much for calling calling from Maryland ... even in Springfield, Massachusetts what's up Stephen\n... a ... a minister buckled wise one I I really enjoy your show your your your discussions are extremely thoughtful I really appreciate that you're very kind\nOn the other thing that they don't want to mention and ... and boy that thing of ties in with John Lennon da da\nDa da da and surrounding they're down towards women saying working class voters\nOn and especially with the Trump presidency they've lost a lot of union ... this is their animals towards like working class voters but but but that's not really my main point on the ... thing I Wonder and wondering is all that did this whole birther thing got me thinking about anchor babies when it comes to welfare\nAll day because there's a crisis on the caravan coming and then two more caravans after that caravan\nUm what ... what do you think any idea of Trump freezing brand new welfare applications in light of this crisis until this gets sorted out because one one of my pet peeves for long long time is that people don't understand that a white in his country means your\nYour ability and freedom to do something it is lots of white the pound and a government desk and expect money\nWell in terms of welfare and and immigrants I can say that technically new immigrant including legal immigrants are supposed to be on welfare in fact in immigration law there's a there's a there are clauses about how you cannot be a a ward of\nThe states are so you cannot be a dependent on the state and that they know and that's that's supposed to be the way that we're in our immigration system is set up as we know that's\nNot the case what ends up happening is for example with the anchor ah the anchor baby issue once you have it as a child who is a is it given citizenship either to uh to illegal parents then\nAccrue to that child so then you start and and it goes to the household so essentially the benefits start coming in for that child and they have to go through the adults right you don't give a a a a two year old you don't give a newborn\nYou know white males I I Want to address is after the 'cause I actually worked in counterterrorism not just some blow baiting talking had no nothing was ... all the terrible white ...\nUh I worked in terrorism both the domestic and the international level I Will tell you why do real threat to this country from terrorism is far and away radical Islam no question about it\nAnd why that is that's all you stay with

surprise could vary depending on your health issues company another family not available and all the\nThis is a perfect example what I'm Talking about here you have a a guy who writes for the Washington Post Eugene Scott\nHe he tweeted out to politifact today are are white males responsible for more mass shootings in any other group you hear this and and white males they also associate with the right even though there have been a whole bunch of mass shooters\nStuart white males that were if anything political leftist but you know that this is this is what\nDo you often hear I mean this is the story line this is the way that\nThey will they'll talk about all this um and\nYet when you start to break this down these like OK okay but let's take this guy the Washington Post ... let's let's think about this let's say white males are the majority of shooters in this kind of measures in this country\nUm\nTurns out that's not true it turns out actually mass shootings are essentially line up with what you would expect in terms of demographic representation or for all the different\nEthnic groups in this country but are you hearing what you find out they've never mass shootings but I'm an\nOverall violence overall violence now you get into a whole other conversation about\nSome communities have a much higher rate of violence in other communities but for mass shootings it's it's pretty evenly distributed um but Ninety five percent of shooters plus I mean probably more like Ninety seven Ninety eight percent of shooters might be Ninety nine are male\nSo as a river we're being told white males or the bad guys that we have to be worried about their the terrorists they're the real threat I'm Don Lemon says that's what that other guy with some British or I've never heard of says Ninety nine percent of shooters or our mail in this\nCountry the country's also Seventy percent white so if if let's say Ninety nine percent of shooters are male and the country is Seventy percent white but\nOnly fifty four percent of mass shooters or white then that means that there's a disproportionate representation\nHum of other groups that are not away their whole issue so so what point do people at the Washington Post and other places think they're really making about this I mean what I remember I said it's pretty evenly distributed but there's actually some\nThe outlier here is not that there are so many are white mass shooters in the country\nSo why are they pointing to that I mean I don't think they really want to go down this road I also think that looking at ethnicity and when it comes to mass shootings is is a an irrelevant and really pointless exercise uh but they'll laugh like to do this because I think of us all based upon our\nOr ethnicity as as a as an essential part of\nIdentity or whether we agree with that or or not um then you get to the terrorism side as an officer and make this brief\nUh that that the Judy torch mafia a moron from Charlottesville is talked about so much in the media just goes to show you that\nThey can't find where ... where's this these white nationalist I'm always hearing about I'm not saying they don't exist and say how many or they're really very very few\nAnd to refer to that as a rise of of real terrorism in the country and now that the biggest terrorist threat and people like that or people like this pipe bomber guy uh we don't have the TSA because of the pipe bomb or we don't have the national\nCounterterrorism center\nAnd the multibillion now going on trillions of dollars are spent on a security apparatus for this country of all kinds because we're worried about right wing\nNationalist terrorism we have it because of Islamic radicalism are less the in the post nine eleven security apparatus we have is specifically designed to deal with the threat of radical Islam\nAnd I know that right now we're in a little bit of a low the terms of radical Islamic knock on wood radical Islamic attacks in the United states but that doesn't mean that that's not the primary threat and people who say this garbage about how\nThe real concern the real terrorist threat the real threat of extremist violence comes from white nationalist a are being disingenuous and they don't know what they're talking about I Know that there are major a major departments\nAnd agencies that yes they do have a they

I mean you know this is where he started\nTo get it okay hold on a second and and also you know as an American when you're traveling in a foreign country if you're an American you're traveling in France and and you're like a I don't want to pay any more American taxes\nWhich you have to do when you live abroad by the way we do that in this country they don't do it in many other countries\nAre ... and you say well I'm only subject of French jurisdiction now because I'm On French draw a French French joy on French soil or I'm always subject to do their jurisdiction we'll say none of your subject or jurisdiction so you're an American citizen I saw a jurisdiction has not just about geography\nAnd that's where this gets more that's where this gets more complicated and there are instances already where\nYou could be born on us soil and you could even be are legally but you would not\nBe a citizen right in the case of the sons of er and taught us diplomats who were born here they maintain their own nationality their own citizenship so that's\nA place where there's no clarity off in the courts and just for Paul Ryan to pretend that he's opposed illegal immigration when he's pro DACA he's ... this huge huge increases in guest worker programs\nAnd has just been so wimpy an immigration for so long and for him when he's not running again to come out now and say this and just get a kick the machines to the G O P\nSide I got to say I was I was pleased\nThat at least at least Trump was was willing to call him out on this one I mean it was good to see that are here we go Paul Ryan is from Donald Trump quote Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions about birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about\nOur new Republican majority will work on this closing immigration loopholes and securing our border\nPresident Trump is completely right I'm Paul Ryan look it's one thing that ... to come out and say look there's there's a lack of clarity on this and you know we had the courts need to take this up and it it is an important issue but that's not what he said he said you know it's pretty obvious that the left is right here that yeah that's right we want people to show up and go and stay\nIn maternity hotel or whatever it's called birth hotels wherever that is when you show up and have a baby when you're a foreigner and the whole point\nIs to get them citizenship here\nAnd you know birth tourism ... that's clearly not with all just but you know Ryan just can't help themselves I he's the guy who clearly has all oh gee shocks\nI I think he is much more about Paul Ryan than he is about the party there I say and and that brings it back to how I don't accept this separation\nOf party and country because I think that the Republican Party is better for the country therefore I support the Republican Party\nIt's eight other bringing back to that formulation for a moment and then I just add one other thing here for you I Want you to hear this is Joe Donnelly who's a who's running in the Indiana representative a or in the sand or other Joe Donnelly here's what he just said during the during the debate yesterday this is incredible liquid want\nWe want everybody to have a chance in Indiana and in America and my officers reflect that both on the campaign side and on the Senate side or state director is Indian American\nBut he does an amazing job\nOr director of all constituent services she's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job than you could ever imagine\n[laughter]\nWhat the heck is this guy said I mean\nCould you imagine if a Republican said that I Know he misspoke but wow hey a producer Mike you there\nOh All right well Rouge reminds you know cigarette break up a DJ brand it I just won't let you know that uh you're oh you're oh you're a white guy but you're pretty good at your job as what you do that doesn't\nSound like much of a government does it bread banks I think\nI mean brand and you you your your name is Brenda you're a white dude but you'd be amazed at how good you are at running the board for this show people would be like\nOh yeah exactly\nSo this is what you get this this is the Democrats the best and brightest posed the Democrat Party\nSenator Joe and Joe Donnelly this is this is what the other side offers up at the Republican did it that would probably be the end\n[noise]\n\nWith all the recent\nNews about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where my data goes making an online purchase or simply accessing your email could put your private information at risk\nYou're being tracked on line by social media sites marketing companies and your mobile or Internet provider that's why I just wanted to take back my privacy by using express VPN expressed VPN has easy to use apps that runs seamlessly in the background of my computer phone and tablet\nTurning on express VPN protection only takes one click\nExpress BBN ...

been back for a moment Republicans lie to their constituents about how conservative they will be\nDemocrats lied to everybody about how centrist day will be this happens over and over again\nAnd Nancy Pelosi here is a perfect example of this oh that's right vote for us and then we'll be more moderate in our rhetoric after the election I mean that that's essentially what you're saying that\nIs ridiculous I I Can't even keep a straight face as I'm saying to you when the when the Democrats if the Democrats heaven forbid bug bite your tongue\nIf the Democrats take a majority in the house of representatives they are gonna go scorched earth against this president because that is the\nOnly prayer that the left thinks they have to get the presidency back in twenty twenty it's going to be a a two prong\nElection struggle right it's going to be one\nDefame destroyed Trump in every way you can with whatever you can and to replay the twenty sixteen election redo the twenty sixteen election go back to a third term of of Obama that's the only thing that left really has up their sleeve here\nAre those are the ways that you're going to see this play out and I I just think it's all part of the polo see that's the classic Democrat reaching you see it as long as Democrats in red states too\nYou know that's what you have Democrats who say oh yeah I'm I I like gun rights oh yeah you know I\nI'm a you know not not\nFor all all of the uh you know in a role\nPro Choice America ... slaughter of the unborn I mean you know there there are some Democrats will play this game of them the moderate blue dog Democrat and a gun toting Democrat and all this stuff\nBut the other day they just to point because there really it's a much more left wing party than they're willing to say say openly and honestly\nAnd the Democrats are now led by\nPeople on the left I mean when I say let I don't just mean their leadership in elected office I just mean the ideology of the modern Democratic Party has gone much further to the left then people are in the Democratic party are are willing to be honest about 'em and that's why I think we have such a\nSo much just not disagreement at this point but it's like we see the world and he's completely different terms what's because\nFrom dealing with a bunch of cause economies who don't pay any attention to history and think capitalism is bad I think that the government's always good the bigger the government the better and you know white males are unimpressive terrible force in the world the need to be brought to heal if that's what I'm doing waste it's really tough to be like yeah let's find a middle ground so just remember\nPollution and the Democrats lie about being moderate and unfortunately Republicans lie about being conservative that's\nThe way [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nI'm Joe NATO the man accused of killing eleven people end up Pittsburgh synagogue indicted by a federal grand jury today Robert\nTowers basis forty four counts including hate crimes attorney general Jeff Sessions will ultimately decide if ours will face the death penalty called the alleged crimes and comprehensively evil according to the indictment ours was farmer three ... three fifty seven handguns and of course they are Fifteen rifle\nIn Pittsburgh David Lee Miller Fox News\nPresident Trump on a campaign blitz ahead of next Tuesday's midterm elections he was stumping in Florida Today for the first to have a lemon stops he'll be making in the coming days Democrats breaking at some big names like former vice president Joe Biden at a rally in Illinois\nWe're in a situation where a a the character of the country is on the\nFormer President Obama's stumps and the southeast friday\nYeah that was you know because when it comes to the fight for some thought never saw [noise]\nSo we have more in that position and the first places because Democrats have failed to come to the table staff failed to work with this president and pass legislation that helps protect our country that helps protect the citizens of America because they did not want to secure our borders they do not want to have a law and order country\nAt the reason that we're in this predicament if the Democrats in Congress had failed to do their jobs and the president's going to look at any way possible that he can find a legally unconstitutionally\nTo make sure that we're doing everything we can listen in a long\nStanding debate there's good faith arguments on both sides so natural reading of this amendment which seemed to support unlimited birthright citizenship for the history\nThe tax some of the draft ers tend to go the other way and courts overview clauses like misses having meaning they don't trust us to spend something you can make a disease or certainly make a good faith arguments and it limits birth racism birthright citizenship\nYeah you can\nFew points here first of all the ... weather or the Democrats they can't have it both ways that can't be the law's the law and then be\nWell but we're not going to do in jury enforcement and let's not being mean let's not separate families and all the rest of the you can have if you go both\nWays and they went out of both ways with immigration all the time\nThey want to say they want a strong border but they don't want to enforce the law when it comes to people illegally crossing the border\nThey say they want an orderly immigration system but they don't want to do interior enforcement is that there should be consequences violating the law but they don't want him to get prosecuted and sent home or anything else right so you know this is classic and then with the constitutional aspect to it have to say\nThe only thing that amuses me more than media lives discovering the constitution is written media lives discover the Bible\nYou know and you know that's when all of a sudden you hear Corinthians to to like wait what what are they talking about\nYou know uh so I I I Love the I Love the\nPut songs I'm going to read you now from the book of poems\nThey say in the media uh yeah so this is where\nYou see that they they have no actual principle that they are protecting or that there there are trying to Institute here because they're ... they're very literal is in a interpretation of this clause\nLet's understand is it's just not it's not clear what that means and also to take a literal interpretation of the constitution also takes into account what was it meant you mean at the time right this is where liberals\nAlways do the right to bear arms you can have ... million\nIn Brussels that's why we said arms yes at the time it wasn't a are Fifteen it was ... but guess what it is arms and that's why it leaves it leaves open for what arms were then what arms are now\nAh and that's why the press the press is any dissemination of information the press is not an actual printing press\nThe jurisdiction there oh okay well what does that exactly mean what does that mean based upon the understanding that the time in what they were trying to achieve with this amendment with the fourteenth amendment\nI'm Robert that the Obama administration\nUm first of all there's all this there's all this rewriting of history now about what the Democrats have been doing an immigration for the last Twenty years and here's a here's a great example of of of that you have Harry Reid\nOkay this is even before that this was Nineteen Ninety three but this is Harry Reid who was among the most powerful Democrats in the country until recently this is what he had to say about illegal aliens played with eleven\nKept making it in to be an illegal alien was\nSo no same country with that\nBreak the law\nWith US citizenship\nThat's right we do this was like okay you know if if I Rob a bank I'll get in trouble but my kid who didn't do anything wrong you know my my baby when he grows up he gets the trust fund I made with the money from robbing the bank\nDishes ill gotten games they could try to think of it any other way they want they tried to go with other explanations of it but that's just the truth and you know ... now you have this debate over the fourteenth amendment of the fourteenth amendment let's just get right to it right now uh it's all about making\nSure that after the civil war is written avian sixty six after the civil war\nThere was no question as a matter of law that African Americans will be granted or or had would even be granted we had a full citizenship and all the rights and protections that that can first\nCorrect but when Democrats say something that's obvious incorrect even if they don't mean it you know that's one thing when Republicans say the same thing they're terrible they're evil there's enough votes\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] the backyard

figuratively 'em and you know what\nAm I been saying all along that there's this talking points\nAre there are thousands of miles away and now they're dying hundred and Ninety nine miles away you know\nThis was ridiculous because\nWhat we're already seeing now is according to NBC News an hour ago oh that's right now that they've assembled and gotten all this attention they're not planning on

about four thousand four thousand people saying that you know they want buses and\nOrganizers oh that's right it's not an organized event my friends but they're organizer somehow they got organizers who are uh are trying to get all these buses to materialize and get this whole thing going and\nWe're supposed to believe that there's that this is just all spontaneous this just came together because there's no there's really nothing in it beyond that there's nothing to be on that\nAs is just nuts it's just nuts and there's such nastiness out\nThere right now about Trump's sending\nMore troops to the border again they're saying oh it's political theater it's political theater well and then in the military is not going to engage\nIn a military sense the military just as they would use you know when we send National Guard or when we when we have military\nThat assist in a natural disaster zone no one stupid enough to suit oh what what they're going to do ... how does that have been blown down like no\nObvious you're militaries there to help to assist in whatever way they can because the interest of the nation and and it's people or the interest of the United states military\nAnd ... this is the commander in chief taken it upon himself to try and assist our border patrol and it's also a show of seriousness\nIt's also meant to say hey you know whatever we can do we will do and we want border patrol to feel like they have the full backing in support of the federal government which probably would not only do they not have under the Obama administration did not have one of the Bush administration\nThe Bush is are bad on the border you heard it here if you've never heard of before you probably heard me say it though but the bushes were baton border issues I mean George W was he was he was really a McCain conservative in many ways I mean he was a squishy\nOn on some of these very weak on border issues and an immigration issues but we just didn't pay much attention to it because we you know have the really existential fight against radical Islamic terrorism\nGoing on um but I I think that the president is from a purely political perspective making the\nRight choices you're to show the difference what is the difference when it comes to immigration between\nThe Democrats and Republicans and the Democrats don't want to fix anything they want to legalize more and more people that don't want the laws to be enforced they don't want a system that privileges of those who will bring special skills and be a more easily able to contribute to the economy\nIn a net positive what they don't want any of that they want as many unskilled a limited\nEducation non English speaking workers as possible or even non workers be what's going on over there was maybe it was possible as quickly as possible because this is how the left as it gets crazier and crazier and more and more socialist thinks that they can turn America into a one party state\nA one party ... a democratic socialist state run by the Democratic party immigration is is central to that plan do not forget it\n[noise] there's a revolt that has been ruined for some time among conservatives because

I don't think we have to dance around that Trump is a very typical guy he's also the leader of the free world and pulled off the most incredible election victory that we will ever see ever\nThere's there's never going to be anything like that they use all the most unbelievable election of your lifetime I saw of my lifetime that's it there's nothing that's ever going to be like that because even if something else is kind of like in the future will be like well remember that time when Trump did that thing that nobody believes that happened\nSo you know I think the guy's gotta earn the right to have a bit of a you know you got to earn your ego I think that's an important thing for everyone to remember and then\nYou know be humble too but that's one part that I don't think we're going to too much from a for Trump but nonetheless he understands people's oversized egos and and this is where the media just really has no they have no response whatsoever there's there's nothing they can come up with\nAs an answer because it's so once you get told the oh yeah that's right\nWhy is everyone else press briefing about Jim Acosta wires every criticism of CNN by the president of a threat to our democracy\nBecause these people have really over inflated senses of their importance let me tell you this and you know you hear this from you know all the time I Am lucky to be in this business and I'm Better at this than\nA vast majority of people were in the business and I don't say that to be a modest and just being object and being honest with you know very few people can carry a three hour a day scripted unscripted rather radio show very very few people can really do that um but that's not to say that I also don't realize I'm lucky\nI Am lucky to be able to do this for a living I Am lucky that this is my job this is my job is just my calling my career because of all of you who listen to the show\nYou are the reason that I can do this and it's only through my service my constant effort to meet the expectations and the information or entertainment\nOr needs of this wonderful audience all of you listening that I'm able to do this but I I have no expectation that oh well you know I'm American\nBook section or else of course not right that's that's just that's just silly that's just nonsense\nBut do you see that a lot of these other big journal ... said that some of these big outlet they really\nThink oh my gosh without us talk of the republic style and probably be better off that's the real for that is more of a Trump calls him out that's when they get so upset\nBecause again they probably would be a you know easier without some of these outlets out there\nI think some of them do act in bad faith and do spread misinformation and propaganda and and don't have a good eat those and an artful of honest people and I mean some of the big the biggest players in the space\nBut it's it's such an important thing you should always feel like anyone that you see in in media anyone in journalism especially on the TV shot things ah they should feel blessed and lucky and be always exuding a sense of\nThanks and gratitude to the audience that gives them their job and the moment that they lose sight of that you know that that then you turn into one of these overpaid CNN cry babies you know the moment they lose that that then you start getting this mentality you see what you know the the Acosta effect\nOf like oh I'm just I I Want to U.S policy questions but first I Want to ask like what the president hurts my feelings are like let me just to

reporting\nBut I Can't help but feel like this narrative that just came out today oh yeah there are secrets of peanut for Trump they're trying to make some people out there remember you know and I know that this was all garbage you know when I Know that there was no Russia collusion that people think there was are delusional and you know and all the rest of it\nBut there are people out there there are people who are still oh I'm On the\nFence about this I don't really know and it and if they hear\nThat there's a secret subpoena for Trump they may say wow I guess maybe there is something

whatever that was a couple of weeks before the election remember how just oh my God it was a terrible so unfair\nI think that they would feel completely a justified in what is essentially a bad faith
