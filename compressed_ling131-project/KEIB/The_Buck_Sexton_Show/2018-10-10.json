{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "Um consequently I was reading in financial planning magazine the other day article that said Seventy eight percent of the trust that are formed a number of fun to meeting people pay their stupid lawyer their financial advisor thirty five hundred bucks to build distrust and then they never retired all the stuff in the name of trust which means the trust has absolutely nothing it's got nothing in it\nAnd so it's up to ... you know value\nSo I don't use living ... uh I don't personally use living trust and I have a substantial network with a lot of detailed estate planning\nNow I Do have some trust I have a couple of trust here or there but the they have different functions then what this guy is describing so no I Would not build the trust now you can set up and you have your attorney or a state planning attorney do this not your financial advisor I trust to a family trust to be formed upon your death\nAnd upon your deaths the money if both of you die and you're minor children the money goes into addressed and then it's management to go to the children was talking about that in the first segment of the shower\nAnd um or a second second one of the summer I guess but you can do that that's that's not that hard to do and it doesn't really cost anything because there's no trust being formed a no trust happening unless both of you died I had that in my will when my children were minors\nAnd then of course my will has changed since the children are of age they're no longer legally children emotionally either for that matter but there we go so I mean some of you have children that are emotionally still minors but of chronologically moved on like the guy\n[laughter] Thirty Years' old skew what he did for a living and I'm a stay at home son I'm a stay at our own sun [laughter] what your button the street [laughter] my sweaters Mike's in Chicago [laughter] Hey Mike how are you\nI'm good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I have a baby step too I have a ton of medical bills a and recently I was originally paying ten bucks a month for a medical bills that I had a they stopped it was an automatic withdraw and they stopped taking out and they've since my account to\nCollections and then to a lawyer and refinance some into court mhm I'm I'm just trying to figure out what my\nOptions are what I Need to hire a lawyer or what I Need to do how much is on that bill\nA Fifteen sixty one thousand five hundred sixty eight\nOkay and what's your household income or about Seventy five thousand dollars for them and what ten dollars a month because of all the other bills yeah I got all kind of a hundred dollars in medical bills and a lot of credit card as well as student loan so what's what's the total medical bill balance\nOf all the medical bills that I have are probably Fifteen thousand dollars mhm\n[noise] and my daughter just diagnosed with a few other medical issues that more bills will be coming so not only get a dollar and a three okay and what were the medical issues\nOr she has what's called ... syndrome a a carry mail formation and then she was diagnosed with epilepsy\n\nOkay you've got to do you guys have had a hard time with this little baby girl honey\nYeah yeah she's got a few ever since she was ... actually have a lot of things going on [noise]\nAnd how much credit card that do you have\nA we are probably at twenty five thousand dollars mhm\nAnd how much didn't want him to do\nThat one's up there that's about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars ... who's the doctor [laughter] I'm just a teacher I like to stay at home mom [noise]\nHuh [noise] All right [noise] um well what normally happens if you have a heart\nAnd you're a good person and you have a baby that is sick you pay all of your attention to the baby and it drains every drop of emotion and love and concentration and focus out of your family your body and your life and it's all directed at this baby\nAnd that was that's what's happened to you which just means you're a good dad and the good husband\nYou guys are not paid attention to the money at all\nAnd all that means is your human but it's screwing up your life now and you're going to have to deal with it right yeah\nSo as tough as it is I'm your daughter is not going to get one hundred percent of your attention anymore I'm your money's going to have to get some percentage until you get this thing back under control so let's put the student loans if they're not already on hardship to furrow\nUm if you scrape together five to seven hundred dollars on offer it to the attorney on this Fifteen hundred dollars is a lump sum settlements they'll take it\nMhm okay because we called today or something that we call today and we said you know we ... what can we do and they just said um you ate it pay the full amount of court t._v. and attorney feed them or hire a lawyer and when the when court\nOkay and you can call them back and say I've got five hundred bucks I can use that for a lawyer or I can give it to you to settle this debt which one do you want to\nBe okay and what if they don't take that and\nYou have you keep messing with international gathering messing with them\nBecause they're gonna listen you're dealing not with an attorney you're probably not even dealing with a paralegal\nYou're dealing with a large law firm that runs medical collections through like a widget in a factory this is your life at your daughter it's the illness and the struggles it's got a lot of emotion tied to it to them they have no soul there is nothing to this thing except you're just a number on a page\nAnd they have a whole bunch of numbers on a page they talk to the car stopped thousand people like you every single day and they give everybody the exact same script\nOkay this is not like you owe me money and I called him we would actually talk about it yeah you're dealing with a robot in a factory and if you get that\nStuck in your head when you're talking on the person on the other line it's emotional to you it is not to them\nIt's a robot in a factory\nMovie okay and just keep that amount and just keep going well I don't have that so does that computer for you you know can you compute that I don't have Fifteen hundred dollars and that may go into court or you're taking me to court doesn't make me have Fifteen hundred dollars I simply do not have it I Do have five hundred and sixty two and you're going to have every bit of that\nAnd if you have every bit of that you have to get a settlement in full nor will not give it to you as a partial payment to get started\nNo I'm not going to put this on payments that hasn't worked for me and it hasn't worked for you but I Will settle this with you for pennies on the dollar and you're going to be lucky to get that 'cause I got so much that coming out my ears from this little girl that I'm pretty sick or you people and I'm thinking about bankruptcy and giving you a zero anyway\nAnd you are having these conversations with these idiots okay mhm now you'd legitimately all the money so we got to work with them but you know you just keep it all of its ... ended up going to court it ended up going to court then they will take a judgment against you you don't need an attorney you're going to lose\nOkay cause you owe them money and they weren't in before the judge and the judge says Mike the all the money and you say yes and he goes guilty\nYou you know your ... are already either taken in this progressive clap trap or you realize that the country is doing really well I mean I was just we just played some\nOn air I mean those were all from CNN and MSNBC you know this is all\nWhat's offered to the Democrats right now whether it'll be thirty days in power or thousand your rights when comparing the geo Peter Nazi\nIsn't serious people don't do this intelligent people don't say this without feeling deeply embarrassed at least\nBut the left does not feel embarrassed\nThey are licking their wounds this week I think that conservatives under the circumstances have been\nA quite generous in how we have responded now that we finally achieved justice and yes it is justice for judge Kavanaugh to now be on the Supreme Court\nOr we recognize that there are other things to turn our focus do we recognize that there are other ways to spend our time and attention\nI was very pleased that are last night President Trump did take a moment to apologize for what was done to judge Kavanaugh in the White House at a ceremony play clip one\nOn behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire family for the terrible pain and suffering you I've been forced to endure [noise]\nThose step forward to serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation [noise] not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception [noise]\nWhat happened to the cabinet or a family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process [noise] our country a man or woman [noise] lust for ways be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty\nThe presumption of innocence a has been something that is under assault here from the very beginning I mean the the the presumption of innocence\nWas going to be collateral damage was going to be a casualty of this whole process and sure enough it was saved at the last moment\nBut but understand that it was a very close fought battle it could have gone the other way and Democrats would have had no problem in fact they would have been gleeful had it gone the other way wouldn't have thought twice about what had been lost in this whole process despite all of that\nKavanaugh is bending over backwards\nDoing everything in his power to make it quite clear that he will be a fair and dare I say judicious judge that he will do everything that he can to continue his legacy of\nDecades of public service you know Kevin all went to Yale undergrad yellow on top of his class at both he could have gone to any one of the big fancy law firms he would've may\nPartner he'd be making easily a few million dollars a year right now easily studies or been in a federal judge DC circuit court of appeals to me probably makes\nOn every now and less than two hundred grand or something like that\nWhich you could say well bug you still makes a good living yeah I get it but you know he could be making millions but he didn't do that he's gone into the judiciary and understands that that's a very important role in very important service and\nThey don't want to look at his record though as a judge where he was ... really universally praise and understood to be top of his field\nThat's something that's different here that's what brings together the different factions within the right Kavanaugh was from the ... gold standard choice\nHe wasn't the go all in and try and own the lips choice at the Supreme Court no no no Kavanaugh was the establishment pick Kavanaugh was the guy who was doing what he could in order\nTo at least be impartial as a judge should be when every case\nAnd they tried to ruin him they tried to destroy his life destroys families destroys reputation\nThat there is no more room for anyone who\nCalls himself a conservative sit around and say yeah you know what you know what the answer is to all this be nicer to the lives take their arguments more seriously play more fair with them be a little softer and your tone with them that's just not serious anymore it's not a serious argument\nIn the lives finally recognize that what they have been doing is no longer the way business\nWill be done that they can no longer shame and destroy with impunity we must continue to win and we must continue to push for what we know it'd be good and writes for the country no matter\nHow much they scream no matter how much they banged on the doors the Supreme Court or mob people in restaurants or act like a bunch\nOf savages we have to push forward and we have to stay United and we have to win Trump understands that\nThat said Kavanaugh's like well I'm I'm Still going to be\nNonpartisan is not about ideology for me so he's trying to do his part to say the right thing and to try and heal the country and so forth and so much as possible foreign ths liquid to\nArticle three of the constitution provides the judicial power Shelby vested in one Supreme Court the Supreme Court as an institution of law it is not a partisan or political institution\n[noise] the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an idle would you not caucuses separate rooms the Supreme Court as a team of nine\nAnd I will always be a team player on the team of non [noise] I was not appointed to serve one party or one interest but to serve one nation\nAmerica's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief and every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open minds\nThat is Brett Kavanaugh speaking there I mean that is what he does that is what he feels that is what he believes as evidenced by everything he's done on the court he was with the majority opinion or\nAlmost all the time other judges looking at the law agree with Kevin ... almost all the time liberal judges conservative judges Kavanaugh interpret the law\nProperly now of course that will mean that he breaks with some progressive wish list items which is why they hate him so much\nBut there is an underlying truths here\nAnd that is that the country is a better place with more respect for the rules were there will be more respect for the rule of law where every American will have those rights more respected under the constitution because ... a judge Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court now because he's justice Kavanaugh\nYou got to get into will hold on a second Democrats decided when they had power to take it to the mat tickets limit and\nThen they wanted to play the filibuster game when they had a Supreme Court nominee and Republicans had a majority so Republicans responded by saying well if you didn't like the block when it was on you we don't like the block but it's on us\nBut more importantly to compare what has happened to judge Kavanaugh justice Kavanaugh saying ... to ... Carlin okay Marco and didn't get a vote no one tried to no one tried to destroy America Arlene's entire life no one tried to ruin his reputation\nYou know there's real psychological damage that is done to people from false allegations people have been as was the case in the ... driven to suicide by false allegations especially when that involves false allegations of rape or sexual assault\n'cause you're an untouchable in society even your own loved ones you know friends and family may think differently a few\nIf they believe that it's true I think anybody with a brain news the Capitol did not do these things certainly his own family knew he did not do these things was completely innocent of it\nBut to compare the Merrick Garland situation to cabinet or even bring them up in the same sentence I think\nLacks judgment I think that that is a poor context or for the overall discussion but then he made one other point which was a good one because you know a a ... I got a call balls and strikes or their says that the only way that this gets fixed as if\nThe American people hold the Democrats responsible at the polls yeah\nThat is the only the only check on the ... that the lead seeks to impose upon the country is for the American people to just deal them stinging electoral defeat after ... electoral defeat and we as conservatives as patriots has constitutional is\nHave a duty you and me to do everything we can to help achieve that reality [noise]\nRemember thinking mum had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower were spot in trouble before it happened well now it's on us to protect our home and family and spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's my parents' trust blink blamed video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home it's like having ice everywhere\nBlink cameras or why are free set up in minutes and run on to double A. batteries last up to two years ... technology\nI'm rich Dennison hurricane Michael now a category ... storm expected to make landfall along the Florida Panhandle around noon tomorrow ... says residents should respond to evacuation orders\nHe asked if you do not put the our first responders in harm's way if they have to come and try to rescue ... and you've been asked to evacuate\nForecasters say wind storm surge rain and flooding are among the dangers into storm President Trump was in South west Iowa tonight for a GOP campaign rallies or president announcing his administration's plan to allow all year round sales of gas was higher ethanol contact\nMy front texting apps and all the\nPresident says it will lower gas prices and help farmers critics say non switching to summer blends will harm the environment the president says he's narrowed down the list to replace US ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley do five people Haley announced her resignation earlier today this\nIs Fox News [noise]\n[noise] ...

[noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bug that is that [noise]\nMakes him all the genes [noise] ideology\nIs a critical component of Democrat belief these days right that we've discussed here on the show in recent weeks for example what they what they're teaching in schools now in some of these departments in women's studies women and gender studies we called the bags\nAt Amherst College where I went I took a wax class that was interesting uh it was actually Islamic constructions of gender so I took a class on a women's engender studies class on Islam who wants to guess how critical\nOf of the Islamic faith the women's in gender studies professors willing to be the answer is not really at all\nSummer how women are treated better according to the class in Pakistan and they are in America I don't know how we got there but that's that's how that's how they thought\nYou know the burqa freeze women they would say I know this is the stuff that I was subjected to college radicalized me as a conservative in a sense of being a radical conservative just means that you know you like celebrating the fourth of July and have read the constitution and it and it ... and it matters to you\nI'm that's being a radical conservative you know somebody who believes the constitution says what it says and that we all have the same rights and we don't change the law based on whether we like or don't like somebody and\nThat makes you went in today's day and age that makes you a radical conservative according to the left\nBut college was certainly a process radicalization for me and that way but the grieving studies departments are churning out millions of young people who really think that they have\nSomething where someone to blame for all of their frustrations and shortcomings in life but there's there's some reason\nSome reason that is not of their own making are not up there on doing that their life is disappointing that they're not as successful or not as respected or not is loved or whatever the problem may be\nAnd it has nothing to do with either\nOne part of growing up I found very important one part of the wisdom of age is just understanding that you know it's it's hard that everybody is carrying a heavy load that everybody is waging their own\nBattle that it's difficult for them and it's not supposed to be easy I mean I I've as was somebody said to me once\nOr a writer colleague of mine writer friends said you know whoever told the your your job you're I think he was quoting someone I don't know who but whoever told told you that your goal is\nTo be happy life [laughter] and it's an interesting way of like the difference in being virtuous and being good and being happy happy as conditional right happy can come and go\nVirtue goodness decency honor those constants those are all in your control\nTo change our perception of happy to such that it's not everything's going great I'm comfortable I'm respected I Love dime revered I Am you know all those things that happen\nMore focused around who am I what do I do every day joy make other people's lives easier and better do I make a positive addition to whatever situation I'm In whether it's in the home or outside the home and my being positive my being additive\nAh they don't but they won't eat started school instead what they want to teach you\nOn college campuses and what the media reinforces now when we're adults is that there are extra colonel reasons for your frustrations as an American\nAnd those external region reasons now invariably have to do with white males somehow somehow white males are now the ultimate ... we we are\nPublic enemy number one in America and there's a lot of us so obviously a lot of enemies we are the bad guys based on this underlying media narrative and once you start to put it in those terms once you were willing to speak about it in an open way you're not saying oh gosh that can't really know that is true\nThen much of what we've seen here with the whole Kavanaugh debacle and I say that about the process it's as any of you listening to show knows I was as fired up about Kavanaugh's I've been about any anything\nUm in defense of Kavanaugh and then in absolute opposition to this obvious smear effort by the left\nDid everything I could I mean I was reaching out it wasn't just normal day of the office

response a singer songwriter named Lindsey lab Stewart out of Texas wrote a parody song about statements I suppose we could say it's a scary time for women according to a her assessments but ah here's look she's got she's she's talented here's out some of it goes play\nA game and I made a name in Nineteen Ninety nine King Live and\nI Can't use them in cages in that in the late in the end of a man\nNamed again\nI'm not I'm not dating\n\nOkay now as I said they're nice voice obviously has some talent political analysis is not one of them a few things you said\nAbout any people say oh buckets art and she was writing an okay but she's this was a parody song she's making a political point so I'm dealing with it as a function of politics and she's responding to the president said about how it's a scary time to be a man\nShe says things like it is or rather ... you can't have the windows open when you're a woman home alone\nNo if you live in an unsafe neighborhood I maybe maybe you feel that way but that seems a bit extreme\nI'm considering also that America is at the now the bottom end of a fifty year declined and violent crime I think that that's a little that's a a little bit extreme but and then to say that you can't go to the bar without a chaperone\nWell I Know a lot of women and having a lot of women in my day and let them go to the bar without a chaperone\nAnd I know plenty of women who wear miniskirts all the time and or would feel free to wear ... whenever they chose to not feel weird about it and plenty of women who if somebody slid into a GM is when someone DM somebody else on Twitter or you know writes them on Facebook or who would say whatever they felt like saying\nSo why are we being told that these are all things that women can't do why make these claims that are ridiculous claims now that's not to say that bad things don't happen\nTo women every day across the country and there aren't bad men out there who perpetrate horrible crimes with someone of of course we all know that that we're we're having we're trying to have an adult conversation here we're not having a conversation about oh you're saying that there is no this is what the left those are you saying that sexual assault is it a problem of course of ... it's a\nIt's a heinous crime a felony for which people are severely punished as they should be\nBut there is a hysteria and this is what I'm really\nTrying to get out with the lyrics in this song and the way that the media talks about this there's this hysteria among leftist feminists\nRape culture on campus rape cultures I mean there is no re culture on campus rape is a is a horrible crime it's illegal in all fifty states and is prosecuted vigorously\nAh so what where is this coming from\nAnd I mean the truth is that the same identity politics very divisive view of day to day life the Democrat Party takes about all groups of different ethnic groups and religious groups also applies to the sexes\nA it also applies to the way that the left used the role of women or the the the ... if you will the the position of women in American society\nAnd it's just not in keeping with reality and that is very troubling because once again we have this problem of how do you engage with the other side\nWhen you can't agree on the underlying foundation of what is real and what is not how old are you in gauge the other side on issues like\nWomen walk around dressing how I mean I'm here in DC I live in New York when this is this is not the Taliban version of America would walk around dressing however they want as they well should and women are\nVery safe in this country by the numbers compared to what what would be the case in a ... a lot of other places all over the world and and there's something\nInherently that feels\nA little uh on just about claiming publicly this way\nAnd it's not just the singers are this is this is common among the ... that that that men especially men who will say things like well rape cultures admit that we don't care about these issues that is a slur that is a slender just not true\nWhy did they go there um because quite honestly they've been fed lives and they believe these lies they really do think that one in five women and sexually assaulted\nOr because of some campus surveys that were done when that is not true unless you include unwanted looks as sexual assault which is what was included in some of those surveys\nOr so the facts don't line up with this but facts in this and with many other things\nMake liberals uncomfortable and so they prefer to exist it as much as possible and emotion first fat free zone\nAnd Kavanaugh's whole situation has been a combination of that\nWith all the news about recent online security breaches

interesting is when you do a little bit of research you find that these devices are programmed by Silicon Valley to be addictive you know they are studying\nBehavioral science and behavioral psychology and breaking down ways for how many times we need to know how many times do we need to create something in this game so that it creates you know a ... for people to be addicted and how many times do we need snack to do X Y and Z to get people addicted to streaks and we're a bunch of puppet\nSo being the personal responsibility girl that I Am it was like oh I Want the free market to shut this down it was hey wait a minute just because you're designing these things to get us addicted it doesn't mean that we actually have to to use them that way\nKnow what you're saying all this stuff it it it makes me think\nOf some of the uncomfortable recognitions about myself but I've had a say in the last year maybe year and a half where I realized things like\nI get a little ill and I know about the only ones I talked to some friends about it I mean I talked about on the show I feel anxious if I don't have my if I don't have my smartphone within reach I feel like I'm going to miss a call I'm going to miss\nYou know something's gonna happen I doesn't mean I have to look at it all the time although I Do look at it too much it means though that you start to have this I Need to be able to physically touch my phone or if there's something wrong I Know I'm not the only one\nRight and that and as you know if anybody who's done it the talks with food you know how you you go to your juice fast for five days at first\nYou feel kind of sick you feel even more nervous because now you're you're pulling all this stuff out of your body that's bad that happens initially initially you have more anxiety 'cause you're like wait a minute what am I missing and might not plugged in I remember losing my phone and a taxi cab and I tell a lot of really\nEmbarrassing crazy personal stories in this book and one of them is that I lost it and a cat it was like I had lost a child or a dog or something that was alive I was completely untethered that was a sign that I had and I coined that phrase OCC\nThe obsessive compulsive disorder people laugh but it's really really true and and and the thing is to you you and I are around the same age I think I'm a little older than you I don't know why just brought that up maybe the audience could forget I just said that but\n... times you know it looks twenty five so for all intents and purposes she is twenty five go ahead my friend\nBut but we come from a time where we grew up and we didn't have all this intrusion we didn't have all the social media\nWe weren't setting staring at the cell phones\nWhat drove me crazy is thinking about kids getting into dating for the first time and they're doing it all on these phones parents\nShould be worried that their kids are not learning basic skills I wrote an article for bus all this week saying you know I remember my middle school dance and the way that you know the boy had to kind of get the courage up across the middle school dance floor and asked me out and face the potential rejection and you know learn how to handle those face to\nFace conversations for the first time these were the things that turned boys and girls and women and men and now you have kids hiding behind these devices they're\nThey're not they're spread it completely thin among a bunch of people things like intimacy and personal conversation or getting lost in those first relationship people have in college and and slightly beyond young kids don't they don't know how to have\nIs their personal relationships they don't know how to communicate anymore because they're doing everything by tax all the time so it's multi faceted the problem I'm having been a teacher for years I Can't tell you how many phones we confiscate it and\nThe bullying that goes on and social media how people look at social media and they think it's we'll\nBut it's not if if I call it the perception deception like you think that somebody's real life but it's not it's what they chose to show you so I really go through all these ideas and a book and it's it's a reminder to you know if you yourself find yourself\nToo focused on these devices and it's fitting in between your your dinner with friends or your relationships with whoever you're dating or your phone conversations you're on the phone and there you are scrolling through your phone you know your your second phone or your your on your iPad\nOr you have kids and you're worried like what is this doing it on my kids don't play outside my kids don't know how to talk to people anymore they don't know how to write properly because everything has gone through these tax this is a book for you to kind of grow discover and and maybe take some some of my tips and if not on the right to it than\nThan just having awareness that just because a product that rises doesn't mean you have to use it and the doesn't mean you have to use it the way they want you to use it it's really a self empowering book\nIf you could get everyone listening as right now ... everyone should check out do not disturb July ... new book out right now about how you can take back of your life from these tech devices that are meant to overtake her life and she pointed out that they're actively trying to do that I mean the people designing them\nBut if there's one rule I mean my my ... and I've been pretty successful in implementing is no phones at the dinner table unless there's an emergency\nBut then you have you ever for folks were a couple of rules\nI mean the main role I Would say is that when you're spending quality time with people that I don't if it's in part than if it's at a dinner if you go to your your your daughter's dance recital\nTurn those notifications off putting your phone away and if you have to take photos this is another excuse people say all the time which I understand\nThey say well I I Need my phone that's how I take photos\nTurn those other feature off learn to use the airplane mode function on your phone I understand you want to have your own for cases of emergency we live in a different time now people are used to\nThat convenience maybe you want to spend two hours at someone and then you want to call home and check in with your son your daughter or your husband I get it learned to use the airplane though the trick to help you said that you actually get a break your phone's not buzzing you can put it away for a short period of time and actually feel\nLike your mind if healing you will feel it I promise you and if you have to use it you know what you take your phone I can take a picture and you put it back in because if it's on an airplane mode and your not being compelled then oh wait\nWhile I'm taking the photo let me just check Twitter real quick own answer this text message\nOh let me answer the female and then

to get away from the whole un climate change topic because there's there's so foolish but they're so devoted to it\nNot just because of what they've been brainwashed into thinking about the threat to the planet I I I wanted to know that that's there there's a whole nother component of this discussion which is that they think that climate change that pushing climate change hysteria is a way to get\nCloser to a one world government and and I know that's that sounds like crazy talk but there's also why ... why do liberals have such an affinity for the United nations the United nations\nHas proven itself ineffectual so many times over at its core missions\nUh it it has not prevented genocide despite UN Mandate to do so it has not prevented armed conflict despite you know un efforts to do so and it often give some of the worst\nMost offensive and oldies regimes on the planet cover for their activities because you know Libya will be on the human rights council or whatever\nYou know that they they have this fall the notion that all nations should be treated as somewhat equal when the truth is that there are some there are some there I say crappy governments out there\nThere is some crap hole governments and then there was some pretty good governments or at least in comparison to the other governments pretty good\nUm and we shouldn't have to treat them all like they're the same but Sanders year when he talks about promoting a shared prosperity and solidarity that goes beyond any one nations sovereignty\nThey now now you're getting further along and to what the progressive and state he is with regard to climate change and and these activities the the fixation on multilateral isn't that you see from a body like the United nations\nI that's why I was all because they view the UN is essentially a democracy of countries and democracy is a is an almost fetish eyes word among the less because they think that a democracy is an idealized state of all people being equal in all ways\nWhich of course interesting to me is somebody who has a has an interest in ancient history and and western civilization is if you go back to the ... the earliest democracy or ancient Athens\nIn Greece or they only had a very small percentage of the population that could vote you had to be a landowner you can be a slave there was a whole\nI had to be male obviously going to be ... you had to be a land owning a resident of what would eventually be the upper middle class or the upper class to be able to vote in Athens in a very small percentage overall so you know ... the notion of democracy as just everybody gets to vote and they get whatever they want by whatever the majority\nAre ... by whatever the majority says that is not really anything that will be a good government system you can imagine that extrapolating ... even further to what Bernie Sanders and others one of your which is all the countries of the world gets a vote on things and then we\nAre held accountable to what all the countries of the world want I don't I don't want to be responsible for what\nIn any way I don't I don't care what European nations think about what my rights should be I don't I surely don't care what Muslim nations think my rights should be I don't care what the nations of East Asia think my rights should you know I just go down the list I don't care\nI Am not in any way bound to

other teams actions that we're ... we're basically motivated by sure emotionally now been motivated by fearless rage is beyond most you know it's all about right and this is getting dangerous why that would be proven to tell people\nThat perhaps it's time to heal and choose our battles no one will listen because there are been debt is to be settled in revenge is a dish but his best or cold in America\nYou whenever I speak of civil war ... civil of people in America I often get told that it will never get that bad quiet and then I fear\nHungry for the sake of clicks or ratings or whatever you think I'm doing well I always say back to people\nThat is certainly cynics that are there in order to keep telling yourself in America is still United however it appears that that ship has sailed and they're living through a civil war in South America can teach you what to expect and it is a real experience that I talked about that in the first hour\n\nI mean I Want to make it clear that during the civil war in a modern day in a modern city modern city like when I ...\nI mean life was normal except for little things that would make you wonder if you would make it through the day or if you would be able to do routine things I mean I can imagine that the United states the civil war would be similar\nExcept that we have the Internet that's the difference the I mean the outbreak of a civil war in the United states wouldn't look all that different\nTo the normal news cycle it regularly you know and that's the thing that I think people don't understand it doesn't look different than the normal news cycle and what they would regularly report it's the same thing I mean it begins with something like a politically motivated mass shooting\n\nAnother example would be a biological attack on the United states either in a major city or directed at Congress or to the president\n\nI Know I've talked about the final blow I don't know if that was the final blow but it's certainly sent the ball rolling\nBecause there was a political attack using rice and a poison that was aimed at certain people including the president the United states if they would have sent all that their members of Congress we would have had an attempt to the decapitation exercise\n\nWe all know that the anthrax attacks happened in two thousand one after the nine eleven attacks\nAnd see how we have the rice attack that happened just before the cabinet vote\n\nWe talked about the Russian each called an al ... tried to use biological warfare is a way to get people not to vote or to somehow change the direction political you have an area here in in Oregon I mean these are simple politically motivated attacks\nAnd these attacks are usually ... posted not only change directions politically but they're also there to generate copycat attacks\n\nAnd these can be both domestic terror attacks in foreign attacks whose sole purpose is generating a backlash they're simply done in order to provoke a response if the response was overwhelming and police department's going to keep up with a politically sectarian violence then we will see the next phase of civil warfare\n\nAnd that is the domino effect if there is an insurgent and the domino effect is in play military crackdown on any kind of insurgency will be inevitable this will be your martial law scenario except it will either be the military working within already militarized police\nOr the police working against the military there also be restrained to start with\nHow or if if if there is an insurgency there will be some re straight at first but then the insurgency military weapons martial law all these things can be applied to a situation I\nDon't know if there will go that far but it can be applied I mean there's a misconception that in a modern civil war there'll be two sides\n\nAnd the reason why we think this is because we live back in history and we all know that it was the union believes me into less slavery and the confederation really being more slavery but most people are thinking right now but if there was a civil war in the United states it would be two sided and that's it\n\nLike Republican against Democrat conserve against liberal no it's not how it's going to be\nThat's not what a civil war will be in the United states if this happens no it's not\nModern civil war would have many\nSo called sight seeing the dirty war South America there were several sides were fighting there were the parent is kind of nice that the radicals are out of college the communist calmly needs to the Nazis the Catholic Church the Jews who until the police the moderate de la ... I can go down all the list of who are fighting against to\n\nThe age group would have their own band if terrorists carrying out executions abductions and torture of course the government had access to the police they had access to corrupt cops had access to military and so of course the government utilize them whenever they could the church would utilize them as well your poll by the way was part of that group\n\nFeeding America we didn't have a left wing group inside violence or insurgency that what sparked a response from black lives matter or me too but all eyes would be an anti far because they're usually the ones that carry out all this stuff\nOn this stuff hits the fan\nOver the weekend there was a vigil in Portland, Oregon for Patrick Kimmons there was a black man who was shot by police afterwards members of anti five blocks streets directing traffic getting harassed drivers and other people the police looked on and allowed to harassment to happen it was horrible\n\nAnd elderly man who made the mistake of not following orders of anti ... what's called a racist at a Nazi among other things and there was chased down by an angry mob where they proceeded to use ... times and other weapons the damages vehicle\nThe police looked on\nThe driver says he was following two other cars that made the right hand turn instead of a left when one protester stepped in front of his car and the other surrounding the man was out numbered probably scared and did not know what he did wrong the truth is he did nothing wrong\nAnd it could have wound up\nWith him being beaten shot once again the police looked on didn't do anything didn't intervene\n\nGuy had about three thousand dollars for the damage done to his car\n\nOnce again if it's civil war breaks out there that are here or in the United states would not be two sides fighting\nWe can see hundreds of sides with hundreds of agendas yearning and fighting for independence\n\nTheir separatist groups in America the militia groups keeper storm front patriot prayer Proud Boys Christian sects Muslim groups all these guys could come together\nAnd feel the flames for civil war other insurgency\nKelly's can be criminal gangs I give us Thirteen black nationalist groups white nationalist sovereign citizens generally any armed organized group with some kind of history to it now with the Internet\n\nWe would see more organized insurgency through social networking\n\nIs anybody remembers the purge threat August fifteenth twenty four team the mainstream news was reporting on the events are happening in Ferguson,

the media is playing into it social media is playing into it and just because it hasn't been declared we can say that isn't happening here it is happening here\nThe civil war we are in now\nIs not two sides fighting against each other there are two sides but liberal and conservative that are fighting against one another\nAnd that is that that is the main fight\nBut what we're seeing if somebody is

war itself composing\n\nAnd the thing is if I say one thing we should all obviously he thinks like this will know by saying that they're going to see things like that no I'm not taking any side I Would say in general\nThis is what we're seeing itself composing there's no official word to be called\nThe wars were then all of us were angry about everything what radicalized about everything we have an opinion about everything but it doesn't seem to be ... or or even a even healed\nAnd the aftermath of course is when we identified the war you're not going to identify it during the war you're identify after the war and that's what historians do\n\nWe take a look at all of the things that we could say were little skirmishes ... and little ideological or fights we had Charlottesville\nBerkeley Las Vegas and what's going on here in my my city is it is just it's terrified all of the front our\nTerritory and we're not fighting for territory we're fighting for ideological or ideological superiority\n\nJust as we risk missing the signs of network violence thinking in terms of classic civil war can blind us to the many actors\nWorking to disrupt the United states from within and beyond our borders we heard Carlos talking about the rough childhood the cirrhosis of the word world we got a benefactor's provocateur doors all the guards plutocrats transnational credible criminal networks we have a Islam we have a border skirmishes we have MS Thirteen we I mean we have everybody\nWants to come here and disrupt the system this is why are you know we always hear about Russia provoking anger this is why George Soros is always the guy that's being said well he's funding move on funding all these other groups\n\nNow if you can think of all these characteristics and you'd think about how we're all breaking down into like these tribal segments and now they're fragmenting everything you can see that this is what a modern civil war looks like\nMore sporadic and unexpected conflicts but with fewer deaths factions\nProdding like mushrooms taking different forms but coordinated across invisible networks waves of information warfare\n\nWe're seeing chaos and exhilarated ... accelerated bizarre of violence in all kinds of I mean look\nWe have a healthy immune response obviously for the local and national authorities\nThe goal of the civil war is not ... but the fragmentation of the republic the goal of the global assist or will America down to manageable collective and his would easily heart and resolve I've been increasingly authoritarian world government and would provide more reason to implement smart city infrastructure in order to maintain full spectrum control\n\nWhen I said get ready for anything

to her but she was heartbroken over trying to do the right thing and she was met with violence by the officer\n\nYou know it wasn't I mean it was the hurt and it was the bruised it was all that but she felt like this is my community and it's falling apart that's the only thing that you think about me she was raised in the northwest and she loves the Pacific northwest and this is something that she can't believe what's happening here\n\nAnd I thought it was just gonna get worse because virtually every major institution right now in this country is being radicalized you're being reshaped by the radicalization of our public lives you could look out at the social media sector you could look at it\nOr you could look at it on on regular media mean ever since the president was elected reporters on both sides of the political aisle from markets big and small have show less restrain on social media when it comes to their personal political viewpoints\nAnd I said dirty war begins with
