{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "... own yeah and just lean you got to have that guideline everybody does single or married that those boundaries those guard rails and that's what your budget is it tells you what you can spend if you wanted your goals and you have a goal of twenty thousand dollars in one year and so you know I was like Seventeen hundred fifty bucks a month you're going to be paying on his car\nOkay which means you're not going to be doing some of the stuff you're doing now because you want to cut you want the car and you want it paid off\nTrue yeah I mean the show it's just you you just punch it in the face hard and fast hard and fast and you know I I think you can pay it off in a year and I think you should commit to doing that and then save up your emergency fond of three to six months of expenses and save up your down payment for your house I think you can do it\nHold on I'm going to send you a copy of the book the total money make over at a walk right through the baby steps of exactly how to do what I'm Talking about I think you can do this if you read that book it'll show you exactly how to not only get out of that not only get your house but also become wealthy okay\nToby is with us in Topeka, Kansas Hi Toby our you know\nI'm All right how 'bout yourself better than I deserve what's up\nOther quick question me and my wife are on step to um we plan on being free within six months should end the ... our\nOur goal is within two years to move now will be on a step three\nUm and my question is if we come in about five to ten thousand dollar short of our emergency savings bond\nBut yet we sell the house pretty pretty good profit ... some of the money from that sell the house into the into the emergency farm in order to bring that up to date and then put the rest toward the house or how would you want us to go about doing that\nI'm confused why would you come in short\n[noise] um just because we need to save up for some other things or she needs a car before we move out of town um and just with the money we'd be cutting andme air we'd come up maybe just a little bit short before you want to move on but we do need to [noise]\nUm well you can do what you want to do I mean you're grown up your lab that there is no law on any of this but um yeah so um what what I Do I think when you buy stuff that's not an emergency before you ever emergency fund you are inviting Murphy to move in your spare bedroom\nOkay I think you're asking for trouble when I got an emergency fund in place a quarter of an emergency it was the weirdest thing\nBut as long as I was broke my wife looked like a country song\nAnd I think you're asking for it I'm Sorry no I don't think are buying buying her cars on emergency\nAnd so it does not supersede\nYour uh your need for an emergency fun now if you want to say three to six months of expenses is your emergency bonding you want to say well we're going to get to this remark and then we're going to do some purchases and we may be put up a little bit more later\nBut we're comfortable with the three months of expenses emergency fund at least until we get her car or whatever these other things are that you're wanting to do that's fine but I bought her cars on emergency\nIt's not\nShe's got a car so\nThat's how we know we don't usually emergency fund for mark is in Orlando, Florida hey mark how're you\nDoing here near better than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my ... been together for about three years or very young and we would like to move on and move forward our lives and get married good Lewin together good uh we don't know over financially stable though and we all want to be smart about it financially ...\nHow old are you Twenty one okay and what do you make\nA about thirty thirty five year mhm and what your career ah right now I'm just a warehouse worker okay so what's your plan I mean I'm sure I don't know if we should go and no no it wasn't as your career plan a trip I thought you know\nPretend like some young man who's a sharp young guy who's working in a warehouse or Twenty one just walked into your house and wanted to marry your daughter\n\nYeah what would you tell him I don't want to know what his dad gummed plan is right Yes sir how are you going to take care of this girl\nI Would love to take care of a\nCat now I'm giving you a hard time brother okay if you're if you think about it that way if forces you to think about your long term prospects which is as her bad that's what he'd be looking at right they'd be saying OK skies a sharp young do\nThey not making anything right now he's working in a warehouse by way but he's got really got a really good career path he's got a plan and it's going to work out I mean by the time he's thirty one what are you going to be doing you know so I'm more concerned about that I think you can make it on thirty five does she have a job\nUh she's in school and doing a part time job at a restaurant when does she graduated from school chatted about another year and a half to two years okay and what were her degree being ah she's Peter okay and who's paying for her school right now her and her parents okay\nAlright would they continue that and she could complete and be a teacher while you are married\nTo ask but hopefully I I think it would go down critical ...\nOkay that's good so you could go ahead and get married and you'd have her part time income and you're thirty five thousand other income knowing that in a year Eighteen months she's going to be a teacher and your household incomes going to more than double it'd be making over Seventy ... close to eighty thousand depending on what she's teaching where she's teaching and all that kind of stuff right\nBut with a teaching certificate in Florida she'll she'll make good money and then you've got better prospects 'cause you're going to start thinking about what you want to be when you're thirty one is for taking the steps to be that so that when you're forty one year also a better one\nAnd fifty one year rich one\n...\nThat makes sense okay there so I think you got the stuff to get married uh but I I'm more concerned about where you're going and where you are today\nTo answer the question of are you ready for marriage and I think you are you're sharp young guy and I'm obviously she's doing she's got a great career track there so you know what I Would want you to answer for your own satisfaction I was poking at you and saying let's pretend it's her dad right but for your own satisfaction\nWhat do you want to do where you go because let me tell you if you ain't nothing you hit it every time you'll be a thirty one year old warehouse worker\nAnd you wonder that there's nothing wrong with no shame in being a warehouse worker but you want to be growing and evolving right yeah you want to be something better you I Want you to own the freaking where\nOK okay you know that that's how I Would look at it and if you got all that kind of talked through and so forth and then you got a game plan C my goal was I was going to be rich and real estate when I was your age is what I wanted to I was dating my wife I was Twenty one I was so broke I couldn't pay attention I had a daughter sixteen and my checking account\nI'm driving all on our second date Monte Carlo that had two hundred and fifty thousand miles a third engine and the second transmission had been hit on every side this car was a piece of crafts\nFor driving along with her second date and I'm telling her how I'm going to be a millionaire and real estate one day and as we as I said that we went across the railroad tracks for fell off my car\n[noise] so where I was right there was not indicative of where I was going to be looked at where I was rather and there was no evidence to say I was going to be anybody and but you got to be a minute or something that that's what you got to be doing\nThis was the Dave Ramsey show

Fox News Saudi Arabia now says they're looking into the disappearance of journalist your mouth can show me last seen three weeks ago and during the consulate in Istanbul\nWe have laws we have laws that are in place specifically so that we do not have people show up\nAnd just stay\nIf we didn't have those those yes we've been open borders state the Democrats are planning to demagogue this issue they are going to use this\nTo try and get their base fired up they're going to try to use this to create this sense of a moral separation between the Trump Administration and the Democrat Party and between the Republicans who support Trump on this issue and the Democrats\nAnd is very likely that these individuals who are going to show up at the border will end up in the interior of the United states ah they will be processed but if they claim asylum\nIf they turned themselves in and they claim asylum they are going to get a hearing the hearing will be delayed so you'll have a ... another wave in another wave\nWhat happens when you have a law that is not enforced what happens when the state has decided their actions that are bad but there are no consequences for that bad behavior what we're seeing this happen right now\nIt is so very easy for Democrats particularly well off connected coastal elite Democrats who don't compete with illegal immigrants for jobs who don't have to worry about illegal immigrants uh and draining\nResources from over already overcrowded public schools public schools that are attended by Americans of all ethnic backgrounds of all religions\n\nThey don't have to worry about that doesn't affect them in fact they view it as nothing but win win by being essentially for open borders from Latin America at least in this country the Democrats get to feel morally superior\nThey get to achieve power and perhaps\nEven eventually defeat the Republican Party for ever by changing the demographics of this country sucks it there'll be a majority of voters built in for always and and forever for the foreseeable future least vote Democrat\nBecause they know that\nImmigrants particularly that all of the people well [laughter] illegal immigrants they're not supposed to vote for members who really knows what's happening there uh but but immigrants in general\nUh tend to vote Democrat and people who come to the country and have a greater need for all kinds of government services are obviously going to vote for the party of big government the party of the state and state isn't that the Democrats\nNow why is it a bad thing for the president to say enough stopped we can't keep doing this the answers to it it's not\nThey won't ever tell you the Democrats the media when they set up this problem they won't act like there are two sides to it they're not going to present this as hey we understand is very difficult problem uh this is how we come down on this\nAnd we would like the president to take the following actions no they want to point fingers and scream racist and they want photos of crying children being separated from parents they want photos of\nPeople looking hopeless and indigent being told by immigrations and Customs Enforcement or being told by border patrol in this case you know you're you're now going to be taken into custody\nAnd they hope to make this an emotional issue\nIf it's really that emotional for them why don't they just make the case that the imagery makes for them which is well I guess we should just taking everyone\nAnd everybody everybody who has been waiting in line for years has been going through the legal process and it was respected our laws are many people who are still waiting to get into this country and who have respected our laws along I I guess they're just Trump's they don't have\nMS NBC CNN New York times Washington Post in their corner so they don't count\nAnd it's just very very destructive and it's also ultimately an issue of sovereignty\nIf the United states cannot determine who comes here under what circumstances than it was just a matter of time before the United states ceases to exist as a policy we will be a different country different political union if we don't control who comes in who goes\nYou cannot have open borders and a welfare state I think the answers are really the truth is you can't have open borders and state\nYou have something else I don't know what it is no other country in the world allows is no other country in the world takes in a million people and make them legal and God Bless them welcome to America legal citizens year in a year at a million a year I'm Sorry legal permanent residents and citizens a million a year\nSo a lot every year working in a million for a legal process\nAnd when when Trump says well for security purposes we're gonna take refugees Middle East down from I think something like fifty thousand to thirty thousand oh my gosh he's like a tell all the ... he's a monster\nWell hold on a second we're already taking in a million a year are we allowed to discuss that number changing to kind of number only go in one direction can only get larger\nThis is also why yes we do need a wall because it's not realistic to expect the president's gonna keep having first of all we have a Democrat president going to do anything and if we have Trump even in office for if we're lucky the next six years\nTo try and stem the tide of recurrent migrant marches to the border is just not realistic by sending additional forces by dealing with this on a one off basis you need a permanent barrier you need a wall\nDemocrats don't want to do because Wal\nFirst off would prove its utility very quickly and then they all look foolish or wells don't work no I'm pretty sure walls work\nYou know if you're if you're going to walk on your neighbors' property and there's nothing there that's pretty easy for going to walk her neighbors' property in has a ten foot cement wall things just got a little harder you may think twice about walking onto their property and trespassing right this couldn't be any more straightforward but they say oh well I don't work it works in San Diego San Diego sector of the border\nFence they're absolutely works so why wouldn't work outs were all they don't have any good answers for you\nThey just don't want to get built because once it's built we can see that it works and once we see that it works and they're they can't do very much about it I don't think they're going to be successful with you know break the wall down\nThis is one area where Trump has an on look he has an unfulfilled promise now as to who's behind this march\nAnd who's\nPulling the strings here I Know there's a lot of theories out there I I don't know\nBut I Do know that this is not a coincidence that you have the largest of these migrants caravans that I I Know of\nJust a couple of weeks before the midterm elections on the way the border\nThis allows the media to play the emotional manipulation game this allows them to forget about the fact that the economy is incredibly strong to forget about the fact that all their\nPredictions about economic calamity because of Trump and all the things that they've said twenty Fifth Amendment he has to be removed 'cause he's crazy Russia collusion that the mainstream media has wasted over a year the American people's time\nOn this fantasy that Trump colluded with Russia worse than a fantasy minute it's a plot it's a plot that was put into motion by anti Trump elements in our own government to undermine the press the United states\nThey wasted a year of our time on this year and a half of our times\nIt's insane is absolutely insane but\nThey can get enough people at the border looking sad and looking hopeless take lots of photos of lots of videos and then talk about how heartless Trump is for enforcing the law that was the law in the books during the Obama administration about how the safety of all involved and also yes as a deterrent\nYou separate people from their children at the border you should reunite them but this is the process that they have had\nAnd if they do this again another Trump them just rations changed the way that they were going to do it because he outcry originally but if there's any separation whatsoever even a temporary separation I mean even a matter of hours\nWe're going to be told that it's heartless it's cruel it's you know it's evil it's a it's a Nazi concentration camps all over again I'm not making that up people were saying that about this\nPeople that we're still supposed to take seriously in public discourse which is\nIn itself just start ...\nWe are in a fight my friends and we need to understand it as such the other side plays dirty what's at

Democrats are are they're running a a campaign at\nAll the local level of a or a local elections\nRather uh the state and and congressional level of healthcare you don't hear about it much but that's what they're messaging and healthcare help to your health care at the national level they're making this whole Trump issue but really they're pushing the health care issue very hard because they know the polling showed that actually for the people were going to vote that matters to them\nRepublicans do have had a gift recently and what you see is that the\nCabinet ... effect in any state that's read where there's a Democrat who's trying to pull the usual you know Democrat oh I'm kind of centrist on these things I'm sort of a conservative Democrat had fake\nIs that's not going to fly that's not going to work [noise] um the dynamic as it's playing out right now is the uh the\nDynamics playing out is that in states where\nIt's clearly a red state and the conservatives Republicans have the advantage Trump showing up for base turnout trumpet showing up to make sure the base remembers that they need to be a part of what's going on here in this midterm election\nBut the dynamics and I think is really interesting and you're not hearing you talk about the needy because they're all they're they're actively wishing in a way they hope it goes away\nAnd it is that in a elections\nThat are in states where it's kind of a you know a a Democrat in a in a red state you know it's a little bit of a of a close circle all across the board they want people to come and speak about the Kavanaugh issue they want Lindsey Graham to go and speak because that's\nA reminder to anyone\nWho's toward the center of just how you cannot trust the Democrats with power\nShowing very red in very red states to get the base out you're going to have a lot of talk about you're going to have Trump visiting Trump's getting the ... he's going to get them to show up at the polls are great\nBut in states where it's a closer call or it's a little more purple where there you're going to have the Lindsey Graham's of the G O P showing up and saying remember what they did a Kavanaugh you can't put these people you can't trust these people with power you are not\nBeing a responsible citizen if you think that these Democrats should be given any any more authority and they're already have all the wives the American people and Kevin all could be the game changer think about what a political miscalculation the Democrats made their\nThink about what that what really happened they thought\nThat they would stop the Supreme Court sheet from going to a conservative constitution list and even if they couldn't stop it they would be rewarded by their base\nRight we we don't know but if you're going to have proof if you're going to show evidence of this you would have to also most likely be willing to say where can I say what it is which means you're going to expose very likely how how you got it [noise]\nAh so I I don't know I don't know what they've got quite yet um but I Do think that there is a very\nReal possibility here that the Saudis are I'm sure they're going to suffer some consequences but they're gonna probably live to fight another day diplomatically on this one 'cause they're going to say that it's just\nThat happened they were in control of it and you know things things go bad and ah there'll be better in the future or something like that and got to remember the Saudis are in the region are pretty important player for us play quip sex as secretary of state

we want to just discount and just fly off the handle decide that we're going to try and make some big statement here\nThere are plenty of places all over the world were very very bad things happen to people on a daily basis we can't make all of at our problem\nI Know that there's symbolism ear to journalist he was he was a green card holder he was a permanent was in this country not the same as being a citizen but\nHe definitely had very real ties to America this was this happened on foreign soil however and so the people that are calling for an investigation I think just don't realize what all the hurdles are in place of that investigation we have no basis they certainly don't have any jurisdiction but no basis\nFor sending any kind of investigative team\nAnd last one the Turks allow it 'cause it's Turkish\nDitch Turkish sovereignty here I mean is on Turkish soil and to the Saudis would have to allow because of the council it so you are multiple levels of complexity added into what would already be an investigation that is highly sensitive\nAnd I don't know who we think we can really trust and that whole process either I mean if we don't send Americans to do this I Would be very suspicious of what information we get it how we get it\nBut if we do send Americans um well I just I doubt that's going to happen unless they were brought along kind of riding shotgun so to

says notice that people are pretty pretty thin on details of what those consequences would\nBe and it's because not only do we have to be concerned with the immediate Saudi response which would be both over and covert I'm sure against our interest in a whole bunch of different ways we also think about the unintended consequences here\nWhat would happen from a major fracture in the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia truth is we don't want to major break with the Saudis um the Saudis are in some ways useful right now and here's what nobody really wants to say\nThe scariest scenario for America when it comes to Saudi Arabia in a lot of ways is actually a revolution and then democracy um the Saudi people in charge of what goes on in\nThat country and representation in Saudi Arabia for look just remember what happened with the Arab Spring with at all it's going to be great in Egypt they're going to elect people western style democracy is going to be great there's going to be human rights and when I go to school and all these ... which I mean that was happening in Egypt beforehand but you know what I mean is going to be a really\nBig step forward and then the Muslim Brotherhood came into power let me tell you something if they had elections in Saudi Arabia the Islamists would be in power there too and I would\nTo you probably much more hard line Islamists than anybody wants to admit or or would a would realize right now because the\nClerics that are allowed to preach and Saudi Arabia right now only do show with the acceptance and the and they say so of the government if you actually had the top pulled off this thing and the people of Saudi Arabia were calling the shots and the preachers were whoever they were listening to\nUh I Will be bad very quickly and that's that's kind of a nightmare scenario it's one of the reasons why the Saudis and the Pakistanis for example get away with as much as they do in terms of our relationship with them is because the worst case\nThere is not that they're mad at us the worst case scenario that the government is overthrown in either of those places and Pakistan\nBecause you have nuclear missiles in the equation it's particularly scary ah in Saudi Arabia we have very few powerful military allies left in the middle east is dwindling we've Israel and then\nIt starts to get pretty thin Jordan is a good ally but it's a small country not but not a prickly wealthier powerful one\nOf the Turks are increasingly Islam ... they can't be counted on to be our friends in the Mid East Saudis obviously we've got this problem playing out right now got our concerns there\nIn his day meter of affection and he is dividing us and those divisions will take years and years and years to here we are one people we're one people we're on the American people and when you say a president in the United states doing what he's doing to this country not to mention\nThe unraveling of the U.S led liberal global order that are most from the horror and the catastrophe and out of the death camps in the ruins of a war that killed eighty million people\nHis fidelity to democracy is Neal is the deputy chief small L liberalism is not there and you see it with his complicity in aid is complicity in the murder of a Washington Post columnist by a Middle Eastern thug\nComplicit in how you complicit you ... how is he complicit what the heck does this have to do with Trump\nThat was on MSNBC they should be embarrassed that they would air that kind of stupidity complicit by everything you said was wrong everything's oh he doesn't believe in a box of really Trump gets shot down by judges in the Ninth Circuit left and right over ... ridiculous but you know because okay well see you in court\nHow was how was Trump destroying democracy how she'll\nDo any of those small liberalism you mean like cutting regulations and cutting taxes that's that sounds like small L liberalism just the guy everything he says it's not true was an idiot [noise]\nDon't want to say mean things you just dumb\nDoesn't know any international relations either like I should stick to like\nYou know [noise] not talking on TV about that [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nLast News I'm Carmen Roberts President Trump prepares for action against a caravan of immigrants from Honduras heading for the U.S border\nAs you know I'm willing to send

Central America\nAnd we also need to make sure that last spring force and that's what we're doing\nMexican ambassador to the U.

B. I.\nC. who you ask for a miracle I bring you the F. B. or\nTo get that one but not really it's it's true that Rosenstein has somehow managed to stay in this role and well I think it's because he knows that the hash tag resistance and Trump does is to just not worth getting rid of them the hash tag resistance would call them sleep late and utterly freak out\nIf in fact there was a a ... a removal of Rosenstein from his duties\nBut some people don't care he got the chairman of the Freedom Caucus Mark Meadows he is calling on Rosenstein to step down at a ... a deputy attorney general\nBecause lawmakers are looking into reports about how roads and saw once talked about wearing a wire record President Trump you know I really do believe that what if when I was a little a little a little nobody CIA analyst\nIf I had said that I was going to wear a wire to try and trap just even the CIA director I I think I Would have been scored it out of the building by ... by armed security I think they would have been like okay you're ... if I said that in a meeting in front of people\nBut for the deputy attorney general to say it and I've gone back and forth on this I don't I don't think he was kidding\nI think that became the excuse but the more I thought about it I'm not sure what the latest if you're like ... two weeks ago said he was kidding yeah but I thought about it more I don't know like I wasn't there that's all I can do is base it on the things that I've heard\nBut you know Rosenstein or has he look he's an Obama administration hold over and he's clearly very\nTight with the DEA OJ bureaucracy and the bureaucracy protects itself\nBut that's why Mark Meadows is finally had enough here's what Fox News reports about meadows a of the Freedom Caucus he says that he made the comments about Rosenstein stepping down\nAs James Baker the FBI's former top lawyer was questioned behind closed doors on Capitol Hill earlier today about Rosenstein is reported comments as well as other decisions made by the bureau meadows criticize Rosen stock for not accepting a region ... testified before the house Judiciary Committee about the record a reporter comments\n[noise] you know roses ... there should be accountability there should be accountability for those people should not uh people should not be able to do and say whatever they want in a senior government role like that just because getting rid of them might feel kind of messy\nAnd that's not the only deep states kind of a deep state updates the deep state store I wanted to tell you about uh you have\nA\nTreasury employee who is charged with leaking financial fence

against leakers the presidents have called traders and cowards\nAre so this is not only Mayflower Edwards who is a senior official at the financial crimes enforcement network she gave a reporter bank reports allegedly documenting several suspicious financial transactions\nVicious show dirty as as I've been telling you I really want to understand this isn't leaking information that is necessarily

job creation is services so when you're a service economy\nThe way to stimulate the economy the way to grow your economy is to allow consumers to buy goods as cheaply as they possibly can and use the rest of their money to buy services or if they're lucky enough to save anything that raises the price is a good\nDoesn't make sense for our economy even if they're paying it to the government has a tariff it's just another cat\nBefore we're close out here's one as a real quick and you get from a grade on the economy a threat what would it be so far\nWell you know I'd have to qualify that I Would say on a general parents have pretty good regulations are down and taxes are down\nBut I I gave him more credit which is pseudo credit and that is he's a great cheerleader\nAnd there is such a thing as subjectivity\nIn in cheerleading and you know an economy that people do respond in a positive way uh this way\nBut the economy has done better but it's all it's sort of like you're doing well if you could borrow millions of dollars every every month you know so uh but the economy on the service is good but it's not sound as not lasting it's based on that\nAnd the payment will come too soon\nI'm sure many recognize that second voice that was Ron Paul and NFL who's saying it's all\nThat have come crashing down before that you had Gary Cohn who is very much the establishment voice in and were economy is right now he's saying you know services gotta ... it's all about services gotta keep good cheap got to get people buying stuff that you know Walmart and\nI was gonna say Sears alright piece years R. I. P. but these are very different views\nOf what's going on right now here's what I Would say about the Ron Paul uh let me let me get with Ron Paul suffers that was from an interview we did on rising by the way we speak to for Congressman Paul [noise]\nAh [noise] he's right Ron Paul was right mathematically historically he is correct or there is a\nVery clear history of the currency in a in the history of the world and it is that fewer currency always ends in disaster and financial calamity\nIs very clear that there's there's no exception it always ends very very badly now that said\nRon Paul saying that the economy right now is not sound too much debt and all that he can be right but on what timeline\nAnd if Ron Paul is right that the economy is going to crash fifty years from now you have to ask yourself today how much do you care I Know we don't want to say over my kids and my grandkids and but how much do you really care and beyond that\nIf it fifty years from now how do you leave the Next Fifty years right how do you\nTry to make money in the markets or how do you try to move on to your career and pay off your house deal with the the basic financial challenges that we all have telling telling you that the stock market might go to zero and our our dollar maybe worth nothing which I I don't think that's ever going to happen but even if it were true that happened to fifty years that's not very useful information right now\nTo Ron Paul's been saying that the economy was going to crash out for a very long time and it was kind of writing two thousand eight we came of on the precipice I get that are two thousand nine\nBut I don't think that he's right right now uh\nI just put his I put his words in there because I Do think that it's a long term warning and especially as we are considering now the possibility of dealing with some of the entitlement programs that are the big drivers of our debt\nWe got to remember that\nWe're we're heading in a brand new a bad place might not be two years from now might be twenty we're heading to a bad place as an economy unless we do something about it and it's very hard to get the political will you know look this is I go home and I'm like you know what I I really\nWish I'd get lean again enough that that I Would just see all my muscles right that'd be fun but you know it's more fun than than putting myself on that pretty strict routine of calories a calories in calories out and all that you know it's more fun eating a big gluten free donut when I get home\nThat's the thing they exist or you know deciding to just eat half a wheel of brie that's\nFun right now and when you're dealing with long term projection sneak and it was in pre amazing breeze always so good when did you live in long term projections in the economy\nDoes that sound will to fancy rags debris debris delicious your is fantastic uh I was like American cheese on American Jews I'm a burger yesterday was delicious [noise]\nAh [noise] nobody wants to be the one that has to think long term no one wants to be the one that I have to think strategically about is you want to deal with your immediate\nNeeds as a Ron Paul as I said he's right but when we just don't know that doesn't mean we shouldn't take action it just means we need to be aware that the actions not going to come quickly and we should\nBalance out what are what what what risks are except what systemic risks are acceptable to our our economy to our children and grandchildren's economies are and then you Gary\nCohn with tariffs on China I I really hope that Trump is right on this one I've given up a lot of credit on the tariff issue\nAnd um\nI've been willing to say that I I Know what the I Know what the argument is against terrorists but I Know the the smart set is almost always an entirely opposed to tour\nTrump has taken a different approach and I think he has earned the right to try and play it out however he can\nThat said ah I Do have some concerns about where this is where this is going to have the economy it's been a ... a few weeks and people have ... ... people have seen some stuff that's going on right now and the economy and that's\nThat's when you got to start really thinking about what's what's happening next because I'm telling you the Democrats easiest path to power is a recession where they turn all this raises the

anyone know bit secretly tucked away and all of our utility drawers he's a tin foil hat that will probably where because we know that no one truly lived through the university this will be objective\n\nI mean what we're seeing limited concepts of time we're hearing about how there are different dimensions we're hearing about there are different ways of thinking we're hearing that you know we're hearing in the quantum immortality I mean science is basically going all paranormal\nAnd they want to quantify all the paranormal in a scientific way scientific way like ah they want to be halfway weekly religion they want to be half way with the conscious that they want to do ... and this is where I was smoking aboard about how\nHere we are going to ship this ... this is a a major paradigm shift\nAnd we have a temporal blind spot in some regard because events happened or we perceive they do\n\nAnd then later we're schooled on the idea that everything we perceived\nAs wrong\nIs that what we think we know it was done exactly what is that somehow we reach a point\nWe're satisfied with their opinion and then all that it's based on his bowl nebulous stimuli we all agree that the students like this is my opinion and this is my truth and you say\nWell it's not truth which just what you think it is the it's all about your selective perception and we know that selective perception is necessary because we didn't have selective perception we'd be transfixed by the hyper reality and sensory overload we're now getting today our brains are being\nI'm filled with all sorts of sensory overload thing about it we have simple perceptions of light light light love survival spirituality God you know\nAnd then we're exposed to a media print television Internet videogames cell phones many other things that you know that are pushing the brain further and further\nAnd all that stimulus his place in a limited area known right there and compartmentalize area called the brain we don't know if the brain is limitless and we have we learned that in old age would boost memory\nAnd we lose perception of time\nI mean the brain can be objective if it chooses to however\nIt's emotion that is driving these guys and so there's this war going on between the brain\nAnd subjective experience and this is what they call the explanatory gap where we've had to bridge the brain conscious is experiencing motion critical announces we're struggling with primary consciousness right now where we wonder if the experiences worth feeling it all we get this shoveled in this disenchanted experiences and feelings we get now are both natural and organic\n\nAnd of course now we experienced virtual meaning hyper reality from electronic illusion\nIt's unfortunate that we're seeing more and more people\nResponding to the electronic illusion they're becoming a non player they're becoming a person who just sits there and watch it watch things or you know go in front of them they they they decide that you know it's better to read the script that it is to follow the follow their own hearts follow their own minds\nSo there are a lot of people that are getting ... right now over what George Orwell called\nDouble speak double speak actually disguises the nature of the truth\nGiving new meaning to words with would appear to be scripted dialogue and it's provided by the party and it's never ending propaganda that keeps pushing and pushing and pushing see many people who live there or not had the the time nor the guess desire to read the book Nineteen eighty four\nOr by George Orwell usually they say things like a big brother's watching you ride ha ha ha you know or you know ignorance is strength or you know that kind of stuff they they know a few lines right\nBut big brother was not only watching in Orwell's dystopian he was capable of brainwashing and skipping the drones were groom to follow the wishes the ministry of love\nThe George Orwell was a British Intelligence officer and with his ability to see the possible future he predicted a totalitarian world where the government had corrupted the language forced the citizenry to believe live as if there were truth and\nThey were being tracked with a ubiquitous tell a screen that was basically extent in every home place of business and public facility today we are still the screens there attached to

music it means and with every algorithm we're slowly being coerced into following anything that seems to be calling her confirmation\nBy so this process we're not only beginning to wonder if someone is watching us we're also noticing that somebody is scripted nuts or is it Lee ... some people and acting like\nWhat are now being called non player characters the non player characters are NBC's or the newest me that have appeared on Twitter and Facebook and they seem to be a form of kind of propaganda against the liberal left\nNow\nAn NBC is a mean there are there are NBC's in games gamers knowing NBC's are okay or actual NBC's or computer controlled characters and video games with limited scripted responses\nI'm given the parameters of the games which they appear for example NBC's may assigned missions to a player like in skyrim\nOr\nThey joined a player as a companion like in fall out but they create is NBC mean and what it is is that it's basically there to um to attack or a mock what it's called left wing propaganda\nAnd I think ... cleverly I I think it's being used cleverly ... what we usually hear his program responses regarding things like fascism\nWhere it's like not being overused outright connections to the KKK and the NBC me mocks left us and they make it it's basically getting expressionless faith is kind of like a\nA statement in face of it and and you can see these things on Twitter read it in fortune and over the weekend Twitter responded by suspending more than Fifteen hundred accounts associated with the NBC name as they claim it violated the terms of service namely intentionally misleading election related content\nSeveral months ago unfortunate and read it the online you know where you go to look at messages on the porch and read it they started using the term and PC to refer to liberals and these people said well they said that you know\nThey've joined the anti Trump crowd because they're sheep\nThey're brainwashed she that's what they believe in and they'd been conditioned to parents left wing orthodoxy in the matter of scripted characters so you look at one of these and PCs they're basically this crudely drawn great cartoon

this plane face to face to figure that to a basically repeats a script\nIt's supposed to be ... repeated scripted would be the script given by most people who are on the left it's it's actually an attack a medium attack on the Internet against the left and you pointed out something in a message to I think is really interesting he says\nThis is Chris showed me he says what do you get when\nYou change every letter in the word mob but by one letter one letter forward you get mob so that's in\nIn in ... uh the\nSwimming or Ford pie and be for mob you put women are for the so that's in PC one letter forward NBC is mob one letter a woman or backward that's just amazing you do did you come up with that\nI'm no somebody else I Can't take credit for that one but it just goes to show in my humble humble opinion\nThe um program nature of reality in of itself\nDuring the last segment you brought up the movie pie and within that movie they talk about the code that exist within the Torah\nAnd so every letter within the Torah is assigned a number and then those numbers um you take mother an added up to the number that father is and then you get I think it's like one forty four and then child ... equals to one forty four and so it's really a string of code that we're looking at here and everything is built upon these numbers\nUm as I mentioned before professor gates had found this computer code within the fabric of space time and um we are on the verge of creating another one of these matrix is we seem to have two things going on right now with consciousness we seem to have\nWhat I turned the organic consciousness which are the real players they're waking up more and more to the illusion area nature of reality well at the same time the non player characters which in this I mean it's been assigned to the left but I think there is non player characters on both sides I don't think it's just a political thing\nI think it's something that um we just based on a day to day basis will I bought it out\nTo you I pointed out to you that you know of course they're attacking those who are scripted on the left but there should be another ... says are you following a

believe in magic at first I thought it was all a big joke then Trump won the primary and I thought hey that's a coincidence then he became the candidate and I thought things were getting weird now Hillary\nHe's getting sick again I Know you notice she she's been coughing and they've been getting it on on on\nOn TV lately\nAnd the thing is is that this all goes back to Pepe the frog\nWhich was a character that they were using to a ... that was I guess a precursor to the un PC\nAnd they're saying you're you are at thing with the fabric of reality this is black magic please stop you are tapping with powers you don't understand if you keep this up you could me must all out of existence\n[laughter] Chris\nGeo I I mean is this a form of\nBlack magic I mean I thought about that you know I never did talk about Pepe the frog and the reason why is because I looked at me the frog represented a lot of people have mixed mixed feelings about Pepe was another one of these meetings where they used Pepe to represent a lot of things from racism to what have you and it was kind of a just a stupid frog but it was a menacing\nOf the medicine type of me now they have the among kill us this balding it looks like actually one of the characters ... it it kind of dreamed up\n\nWell you know what's interesting is um it said Joe magic as you mentioned before and essential is when an outcome Mr Black magician will take a series of letters or symbols\nAnd you may not necessarily recognize them but I notice that this Pepe the frog guy he\nWas he was drawn very strangely just like these NBC's The NBC means are drawn very strangely now I'm not that familiar with a cult symbolism but I'm pretty sure that if you look at ... work or something like that you can find something similar with a similar type of symbol\nThat's being blasted on the human consciousness over and over and over again\nAs a matter of fact I'm Crowley how to spell that he used to do and this was something that he was very famous for him he\nUsed to be able to take control of the body of one of these on PCs and he was why there's a story of him walking down the street with a some prime minister or something like that and he says watch this and he points to the guy in front of him any needles down and the guy in front of him starts kneeling down almost as he is controlling them like a puppet\nNow if one person can do this and matching what's going on through the Internet through the mainstream media so on and so forth and people have lost their ability to think I mean if I can take a political here for just a moment I'm coming into this\nSelection I've just been so jaded by the oligarchy that we've had that I thought I was just going to be the same BS coming through the pike and then when Trump got it I was still a little skeptical but I'm looking at Trump and thinking wow I Can't find any fault in this guy I mean you know I don't agree with everything he does but considering what we've had in the past\nTrump is has actually done a really good job the only thing I can fault him for is that he likes to eat a steak well done with ketchup which to me I can should be an impeachable offense to ruin an iguana fake like\nThat but yeah I mean you look at his behavior sometimes are real apps cloud of times but you know he's the president and I mean president that act\nThat way before I mean Bush acted like one Cheney was a bigger one I mean imagine having Cheney for president\nBut the thing is we're not voting at a personality were voting in somebody who can be the commander in chief and that's what I look at it or not we you know everybody wants to have that swab personality I mean we had that and we had that in spades with with the with a rock Obama them just saying it it was just something that uh\nYou know I guess Trump doesn't have he doesn't have that same swab courage but he's like this down and dirty ugly guy wants to get stuff done but I Am really really interested in this in this angle about how these means or whatever the artist with NBC character\nHas gone from being this harmless little stick figure face to a very powerful Internet very powerful computer ...

and coats\n\nAnd this is white tonight the argument that we're making Chris Jewish Riggio her on the program Dr ... the argument that we're making is that we live in a matrix\nAnd the reason why is because in PCs non playing characters are easily programmed to put the organics the ones that are ... that use a good I'd say critical analysis are the ones that will not be program at bay are the ones\nThat are going to try and pull us out of whatever it is rent otherwise we'll be mesmerized by this online magic Chris\nGeo will go back to ground zero it's good to have a year\n[noise] um let me finish up this point I was making real quick about the politics because here we have the mainstream media\nI'm putting out a program and the program has been racist racist racist racist thrown at the White House right and then all of a sudden Kanye West shows up and he has this meeting at the er at the White House and what I saw was the dissolve meant of the ... agenda\n'em to divide on race and then the mainstream media turns around and uses a derogatory term against Kanye that I Will not repeat on this brought the N. word but it\nIt go ... yes and ... to show how the script all of a sudden changed yeah what\nHave you did you see the the the there was a traffic is being blocked in Portland ... members were blocking and directing traffic world guy pulls up in a car\nAnd some guy who was holding a plate of tacos I don't know why but he was with the group and he started yelling at the guy goes you look like Whitey I bet you're a Whitey Archie says to I'm looking at going this guy's a white guy calling another guy Whitey same with what happened with Kanye we have a a a black faceless and PC\nOn uh CNN calling ... n word that can read his what he said\nExactly and so all of a sudden what happened is that the scripted just changed on the PCs and they don't know how to handle this and it just goes to show they're just running a script or that they've been pre programmed to it\nSo um you were talking about numbers and number ... symbolism and numbers play a big big role in this you were talking about the uh\nMeans the way the means or ... and so on and so forth I mean there are so many different levels that we can take this to numb from what direction do we break this down in because well I just it's huge I just want to\nPoint out that parents can actually called me and this is the sport is like not in Nineteen Ninety this is\nTen Twenty years before this time that we're in right now he's he called the mean\nThe smallest unit of an idea that still has coherent see and what a genius to biology I mean it's to ideology and so you need a lawn chair mean boldly and see if it will replicate just like jeans replicate and in fact and move into the Oregon is enough society and the waiting as I Do that society operates on a kind of\nBiological economy then I Believe these means are the key to societal evolution\nAnd you see with within PCs I I\nJust have to say it's almost like they they don't understand how to even make means\nIs that it doesn't make any sense to in order to send them in some way whereas the organics are full of them in and constantly creating these names and they really do change our society and drastic wage very quickly\nWell maybe I could use some other magical terms of people are more familiar with like top as a there's a ... a mind form that is that when you manifest it becomes an ... which is of course another a cult concept which is a thought form or a collective group mind making a thought form that becomes a ton of it's kind of like slender man okay\nI I Would say that ... kind of an ... Letterman really\n... is is fictional he was made on the Internet okay but he becomes real\nWhen two little girls lure another girl into a playground and stab her\nBecause they said that this this egg records that serving a master whichever the master the creator is is actually influencing these girls to go and kill something so that's what you got you got a ... you ever told but you have an ... and those things are are set out to grow into become either monsters or or just serve\nIn and once again the hunk ... says the same thing and what is\nThe un PC me it is the bold\nOr you know ... basically does the will of its master\nRight exactly and it it really it's it's one of those start changing devices that that as a result it's the backlash\nAgainst this these autonomy and that means a lot of time and it's I guess you could say\nOr anti autonomous thinking process that just totally dissolved any boundaries that that that whenever the media or whatever the the whoever's in control of all that is putting out it dissolves all of that in a in a\nSplit second and it and if that's what makes them so angry about this when ever people do come up with means that really do change people's minds in a really quick way\nWell this is even more ancient ... go back to the Jews okay let's go back to ... what was going but he was a a it was an animated anthropomorphic being made of clay\nThat was there to protect it was a monster that was created to protect the Jews pretty much it was there to protect the children in Prague and and so they created this this this creature out of clay uh he was harmless to to uh those he was a made for but he would attack those who are trying to attack them\nAnd and so this is the same principles the idea of creating\nAn Internet Gulen creating an Internet her monkey was an Internet tool but an Internet ... if people you know we don't understand the meanings have means means are certainly like this they are the thought forms that when when they are unleashed\nThey can cause trouble they can call it causes ill will but once again goes back to what Chris has been saying is is if it's so easy to create a ... if it's so easy to create an\nAnswer ... perfect form that is illustrating a programmed a botched if you will\nThan we know that we live in a matrix we live in a programmable world that the that they're it's getting easier to program because people are becoming more susceptible and\nNot dealing with plane consciousness they're not dealing with a will be called primitive consciousness the idea that they can either field or understand anything at all and I think this is the confusing part is because people are getting so confused now that they're reaching a point where they can't even find you know simple\nConsciousness they have to seek it out elsewhere Christian ash Riggio with a sit on the ground zero fasting discussion and I Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred BC me and PC mean it's certainly a stimulus was certainly a sign\nIt's natural law it's it ... or you hurting somebody they argue impeding upon somebody's freedom or are you a damaging somebody's property\nUm if you take a look at the situations around us and you asked yourself does this piece of legislation there are about to pass\nIs that impeding upon freedom is that impeding upon life liberty you know these basic fundamental principles of freedom\nThen you can take a look at the piece of legislation for example as what it is instead of saying well my party says this and so I have to believe this from my party says that um so I have to believe that\nAnd then presumably realized that this whole divide between us has been systematically programs within the matrix to keep us fighting with each other up while they continue to manifest all of these realities that they once\nBut really to power lays inside each and every one of us to manifest our own reality as I said before I have the CIA document in my hand called\nUm analysis and assessment of gateway process and it shows you how to manifest of reality around you so by realizing that we are in a matrix realizing that you have the power inside of you to manifest your own reality\nWhat I always tell people as we look at the the huge mountain it's in front of us you know when the truth or community and the media community you know all of that and we want to change the world but\nThat's impossible we can't change the world all we can do\nIs just change ourselves but we'll begin to also
