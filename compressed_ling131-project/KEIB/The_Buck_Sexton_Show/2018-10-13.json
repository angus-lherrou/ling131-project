I Know I mean I don't know I don't know if they feel trapped I'll be happy to close on this\nDeal when my trailer cells yeah when my trailer is so my trailer hasn't so I Can't close until that happens and so you guys need to dump us in the street dump us in the street and go on to them that guy and that's probably what's gonna happen\nOh well there's a house on every corner in Denver you'll get you another house and don't get desperate 'cause as soon as you feel cornered as soon as you feel desperate is you know you feel forced that's when you do stupid stuff and there's realtors feeling desperate they're trying to get your clothes on something you should be close on\nIt should've been a contingency to start with but now we're going to make it on because you're just not going to close\nBecause if you do you're going to regret it you're gonna end up on both of these houses for ten years\nAnd then you're going to have a real problem it's going to damage or finance or she's going to take a decade to recover from a bad decision walk away or tell them just we're gonna have to break boys and girls until this thing closes if we can get this closed and we'll close if we can then we're not going to be able to\nOh we're gonna go to the next guy well I don't know I understand you have the right to do that 'cause I'm not closing on Thursday and then but if you want to wait on us we'll be happy to close on it will keep our word but it's got to be based on this thing selling\nAnd um I Would walk to exactly what to calm down\nMark is with us in Indianapolis I mark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThank you for your service or thank you how can I help\nLaunch sixty and I have six little properties three that are free and clear and three that small mortgages and I just always assumed that we would probably sell one of the time of basically about now they'll start now and then that would be part of your retirement and a friend of mine said well wait a minute ... have you with the\nUh the reason I thought we needed to sell them I thought that to Social Security at a limit of around fourteen thousand or so that you can make per year before they uh [noise]\nProcess you know that's\nThat's something that nobody could really know that's something that nobody was able to to figure out until now what it looks like oh that's right that\nTelevised ritualized torture session of Brett Kavanaugh on national TV turns out Republicans haven't forgotten about that\nAnd turns out it was a reminder of what we face on the left but I think that the Kavanaugh debacle for the left was really just\nIn a sense the last straw that has pushed them over the edge but they were already heading in that direction and these these symptoms of the mass delusion of leftist that are manifesting themselves with these mad a masters\nIn these mobs coming together and screaming and yelling and this mob mentality and on and the\nReally the lack of ability on the media's part just set the narrative the way they want you in the air rage which comes out now moral here I think it's because they realize Trump is winning\nHe still winning they haven't been able to take him out of office with this Russia collusion investigation nonsense\nThey haven't been able to sing came with Republicans or you know anybody who's persuadable anybody who's open minded about this with all the different allegations of the twenty Fifth Amendment and uh the investigations that his finances I mean the New York times did I think it was a twelve thousand\nWord essay on Trump's taxes stretching back to his father's taxpaying practices in the seventies\nI think there's some stuff about him in the sixties in there I mean that they they went way way deep into was and I read this piece I thought to myself this is this is kind of like the scene and John Nash the John Nash\nHasn't a Beautiful Mind when he's got all the crazy riding on all this stuff all the formulas and the wall and you and then you realize oh\nThis person has a problem the media has a problem from maybe has caused it but they're the ones with the problem\nThey are no longer objective in all of this and now it looks very likely that the Republicans are going to keep the Senate and\nThey have a fighting chance and people are saying it's a twenty five percent chance I'm telling you I think it's more like fifty fifty right now that the GOP can hold the house\nAnd what will liberal say that and they they really going to all of a sudden you know just discovered that oh Russia manipulated this election certainly is that going to be the play it might be but I don't think they have any real belief that that will that will stick with that will work\nWhat do they tell themselves now I Know that they comfort themselves with the constant refrain of Trump is racist Trump is a is a a sexist sexual assault or a a traitor a crazy person all these they say all these things\nBut what do they tell themselves about the politics of this country when the president that they say is the worst president of all time which is a pretty common thing you hook you'll hear on the left the worst president while time unfit for office should be removed from office\nBecause of his his temperament and his judgment in the way that he is doing his job they say he should be removed for that reason\nAnd it turns out he was doing a really good job\nThe economy is chicken but and I'm here in for a lot of people who know and this is their life's work has studied is that\nEven though there's this sense right now oh maybe we have what Greenspan would have called irrational exuberance of oh my gosh things are so great they're just gonna keep getting better and better some people have that a lot of people have the oh it must get worse it must get work will get worse but they've been saying that as you get worse last Eighteen months\nAnd it has it so what do they help themselves what did they come away with\nAnd this then brings me to the outrage mobs anti ... and the\nUh you know the the the women's march ... creatures in the anti Kavanaugh hordes and the the stalkers because that's really what we're talking about these stalkers\nWho are activists that try to find Republicans to harass them to frighten them to scare them although we had a Republican who put a block slap on some hallway stalkers today we'll get to him later\nBig high five\nBugs issues increasingly looking like the last\nIs going to have to live and Trump's America for many many years to come and I don't know how they're going to to handle that I don't know how they're going to deal with this is why I've been so worried recently about the possibility of real violence\nBecause they've already gone to the mat they've already taken the dial to eleven they are doing everything everything conceivable\nIn terms of propaganda and organizing and media effort and they're doing everything they can to stop this political movement that Trump is a part of from from reaching its its intended goals\nFrom doing what it has set out to do from the beginning and they can't stop it\nAnd I think that what set in with many of them is is not just a a panic but also a sense of helplessness\nI mean the last must be telling themselves we thought we were going to get this guy gone with the ... we thought we were going to get this guy gone with any number of different floors and if we couldn't at least get I'm gone at least we could we could stop him and have you know Americans turn on him and his base turn on him\nAnd the opposite is happening I\nMore confident in this president and what he's doing and his yes his message as well as his policies with each passing month what does that mean for the left how do they try to rebound from this how do they try to come up with some counter narrative\nI don't hear it yet all I hear as rage annoys an anger and if this continues\nOn if they don't have any real counterpoint to counter punch for what Trump is doing I worry about what their next move will be because I Know this will not be rational\nAnd it will not be in the best interest of this country that we know for sure\nI I tend to think that we could be facing some kind of October surprise along the lines of what they did with cabin on the very end of the nomination process\nIt's not enough that they don't have anything they'll manufacture something they will create whole claw some means of trying to take take the the Trump Administration down a few notches at least enough\nUh with regard to a ... with regard to force transfer of technology there are structural issues technology issues right get with family jewels there's no reciprocity I'm trading in Paris\nSo there's a whole menu of things and I hope they get around to talking about it perhaps the Chinese will be a little more um cooperative\nAnd with that whole menu of things by the way they put little brings up those have been problems for for decades\nBut other administrations didn't even try to fix those problems other administrations just allow them to continue on why oh we can we we can't mess with China\nSomeone give us a reason for that\nWhat's the explanation for why we can't mess with China\nThey're not Texas right don't mess with Texas a ... suffering in silence was a better option know Trump is taking on that are taking on that whole slew of problems\nAnd could lowest right you know the Chinese government needs to be brought into line here and it's going to require some pushing it's not an easy thing to do but Trump is taking on things that are important without regard you well is this the simplest route\nObama showed his what eight years of sitting back\nRelaxing and not really doing very much in thinking you're brilliant for that uh when it comes to foreign policy he showed us what that results in on the world she knows a lot of strategic patience leading from behind a lot of fancy ways of saying don't\nMake any decisions just focus on the process lots and lots of processed lots of talk\nWell turns out that if you are willing to tackle heart problems and make tough decisions you could accomplish things in the world stage that the Trump approach on the economy on foreign policy [noise] just the Trump for a job that you could almost say\nIdentifying a problem and taking action to fix it is the Trump

[noise]\nThe Steele dossier comes out sometime early July when did you personally learn about the memos and the dossier\nSometime in the fall I don't remember exactly when\nYou're talking for all of the parks are full of sixteen right so who told you about them [laughter] I don't remember someone on my senior staff you know how they were described I remember they brief me about it explained that it came from a reliable source\nWell it seems ridiculous that I'd have to do it when everybody was no collusion what is necessary to get it would have spent\nMillions of dollars doing this and it's a disgrace that on top of that committee and out in the Senate out she take a look at what they've done an interview everybody can you can imagine you could interview and then Richard Burr says a few days ago and\nWe found absolutely no collusion different there is no collusion\nBut it sure that into because it's bad for the country that when you talk about it and the country it's bad for the country\nWhen is this a farce what also this ongoing nightmare uh this bureaucratic\nMachinery of destruction known as the uh the Mueller probe what is it going to end\nI Know it's not going to be before the election but I certainly hope it ends within weeks after the election I I Do have concerns are going to stretch this thing into twenty Nineteen\nBut I I just would love to think that enough people have been paying attention and realize what a scam this whole thing is and what a deep state soft coup disgraceful pile of garbage this whole\nEffort to stop and undermined and remove all of these things President Trump has been\nYou know there was a story there was something that I didn't get a chance to tell you a better in the week the Mueller probe he hears the kind of stuff we actually get from this\nOngoing national debacle of the Mueller probe quote a California man engineered and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's election interference was sentenced on Wednesday to six months in prison six months of home detention two years of release\nRichard ... pleaded guilty to one count of identity fraud seven months ago and cooperative with Governor investigators in the case against the Internet Research Agency the Russian troll farm accused of interfering in the twenty sixteen presidential election\nJudge dad me fried Rick headed down

individuals circumvent security features of online payment companies\nHe generated between forty and Ninety five thousand dollars by acquiring and selling bank account information he has admitted using stolen identities at a bank account that were later used by Russians\nSo you know I mean this guy\nThis guy had nothing to do with him you know he's a petty criminal nothing to do with Russia collusion nothing to do with working with the Kremlin and these are the kind of people who get caught up in this we've got ... Papadopoulos Alex vendors Juan\nNone of these people had anything to do with Russia collusion and yet we sit here\nAnd wait for this final report to give us ... at the end state outcome other smaller ... what a mess what a total mess I mean I can say this to bring us back to what we're discussing earlier in the hour\nUnder any normal circumstances of the American electorate judging this president on the merits of his presidency and therefore the party you leave the Republican Party by how things are going and basing their votes\nUpon that by any objective ... criteria that we can point to the country is better off now than it was a couple of years ago Trump\nIs a more effective commander in chief then Obama was the economy is growing more rapidly and has more more head re more room to grow even further because of what has been done because of the tax cut the deregulation\nAnd yet what has been the focus this whole time that that it's not that the Democrats have been making these Ernest appeals about how they would better run the economy all they do is try to tear down they just play the politics of the attack dog all the time\nThey don't offer a creative solutions I don't what they offer you as more constant nonsense about the Mueller probe what they offer is eight eight continued national\nConversation on whether or not you know there's something in Trump's tax returns from Fifteen Years ago that would\nTell me tell me what's ... what's the aftermath like in the White House with the ... visit obviously a tremendous amount of of news coverage I have never seen so many people doing psychiatric a\nAnalysis with with no degree in psychiatry never meeting Tanya but just watching this on the news you got a lot of analysts talking about this one did the White House feel like this was a pretty big success all things considered\nSo the White House staffers I mean the ones who are most concerned with ... obviously a bit annoyed by it they they're saying you know why the president detracting away from his great we\nWith Brett Kavanaugh but the ones who are a bit more culturally a chair and know that you know more Americans saw that clip with ... and anything else at the end of the day you know if you were to go around and\nAsk somebody you know a universal studios like they used to do do you go on to a late night shows and be like who's Brett Kavanaugh most people are not going to be able to tell you but I can guarantee you people saw that clip with Kanye West up from the president perspective\nIs using the star POWER UP Kanye in order to talk about you know talk about criminal justice reform it really was kind of a I have a whole area moment\nIn the oval office although it was funny to be behind the scenes that was in the at the White House while all that was occurring and I saw that the pool they select group of reporters that day\nCome out from the oval office and they were just I mean they were blown away you could see it on our fate and they were just\nSaying that was wild one of the camera guy told me and the thirty years' that he's covering the White House Thirty Years' day to day it never seen anything like it\nI can believe that [laughter]\nThat's probably I think that's probably as a safe bet oh what are we expecting tonight that Trump's out in Ohio I mean he's he's kind of the secret weapon on the campaign trail for the GOP hadn't into the midterms isn't it\nYeah I mean the the amount of coverage in scrutiny that his rallies get it's just an automatic boon to any candidate who is running because people have actually told me that for other campaign that one of the things they love about when the president on it you get now\nShe'll TV coverage you know when is the last time\nAge you know some house candidate in uh Ohio six\nIs going to be getting in a ... major Fox News viewership and and the president directly plugging him that helps with their donations it helps with their brand awareness it's free media it's one of those things that the president or the president loves doing relatively using the bully pulpit\nTo push candidate in terms of what he's going to say I have a pretty good idea you know he he's been having your saying campaign rally now for basically the last two weeks almost every single night\nHe's got one and I got one tomorrow night you'd had one I think five nights prior and it it just it's a it's an hour long its rockets he talks about the flag he talked about\nHis record North Korea he loves to bring people inside the room and it's just it's a very high energy environment\nYeah I've certainly picked up that there is no low energy Jeb vibe at the Trump rallies and that is that is absolutely the case of what what are we what are we expecting by the way on on the policy side for for next week is there anything that that that you think is going to get up on the radar either from the White House side or do we know they're really going to\n... or ... rather some of those documents Trump talked about that if anything we should be prepared for this coming week\nYou know I I I don't think that there's much that we should look for just because lawmakers are all out on the campaign trail they were desperate\nThat last ... last night to push through those judicial nomination so the Senate could go home everybody's focused on reelection that being said uh you know in terms of on reduction that's something I you know I've been asking a lot of questions about at the White House\nUS President about that right I mean you ask them about their reactions the oval\nYeah absolutely I I ... a week before you did I think and and and I you know that's something that we've both been interested in but the issue is that he had he had to take the issue over to the inspector general and I asked their standards about that\nAnd a lot press breathing that we had and she refused to commit to a timeline of before the mid term so\nFor now I don't think we're going to be seeing anything in terms of those on redacted documents and I really don't expect you know knowing the inspector general horror with ... he is very uh very cognizant of of dropping things and politically sensitive times and he does take quite a long time in order to do these reviews so it's probably not coming anytime soon\nWhat's the best part of being a White House correspondent in the White House all day soccer\nThe best part is just be able to see I mean you can be they're up front to to get yelled at by it rock like we were yesterday a somewhat it's one of our what our colleague we were just standing there I mean you're you're standing there waiting for these people to come in and you shot questions at a\nAnd a ... somebody asked him Mr Rogers which I thought it was funny to all of this rock as mature rock are you going to fire or do you think Trump's you fire Jeff Sessions he said he should fire all of you before\nThat's amazing so by the way it usually as a as a as a New Yorker and as a journalist I feel like you've always got to take the um\nYou know act like you've been there before attitudes all things so I I Would very rarely be like oh here's a here's a person of of prominence let me take a selfie with him I Would judge no one for going up the kid rock and beyond that 'cause I have a selfie 'cause this kid right [laughter]\nYeah exactly it's it's like that ... day to day stuff it's oh if Jim grounded here get rockets here uh you know Tom Brady Rob Gronkowski or you get to meet people and talk to people that you you'd never your wildest dream\nWould be able to do and then at the other the other hand you also get to talk of the president the United states and you get to ask him questions on the most consequential issues of the day so\nIt got to be the most on President in history to get to have a conversation with I mean I Know you were in the old recently I was the over ... recently ... it's a it's like the Trump show you really don't interview him so much as you try to guide this this one man phenomenon as he is speaking\nYeah it really is a force of nature and and it's like you said you you you you you'll throw something out there and he'll latch on to it and then he'll he'll flip it around three hundred and sixty degrees and then go another one eighty in another direction and you you try and flipping Ninety two a little bit of where you want to go and you just see what a gift\nAnd that that really is exactly like I said it's it's\nWe we love to tell you know and the press it it's just one of those things where you can always get an honest answer\nOut of ... it's it's hilarious I think yesterday or two days ago somebody asked him and said have you talked to the Saudis about you know the\nCurrent situation with this is missing journalist probably murdered journalist and he just said I don't want to say that yes and well\nYou know who did you talk to you that I don't want to say but at a very very high level and he just started going into all of the the discussion there is the vote you know what you see on TV is absolutely what you get in person\nThe other ones that give me one favor soccer can you spread the word over at the Daily Caller where you're the White House correspondents that book section as an open challenge to anyone on your ping pong table there can only be one and I think I Will come out of

um he also talked about Chicago and and and and the crime rate there and he talked about unemployment he talked about the thirteenth man and he talked about you know ... not being able to read even all over the place had talked to someone who's very familiar with the car dashing they used to be\nA text messaging with re jak I you know who ... he was once close with Ken ...\nSo\nCovers all these different issues a lot of them are issues that are actually a really high importance in the policy discussion in this country\nBut has to say that either he's he's crazy which strikes me as a a really underhanded a nasty way of of well undermining his argument\nBut then when you when you listen to some of things can you said it's not that he's crazy it that\nYou could maybe say he's crazy like a Fox I mean it's it's that he actually hit home with some of the things that he was saying when the when I went back and and read the transcript today and spend a little more time listening to some of the soundbite and when you take away all the\nYou know the the sort of flashing lights pomp and circumstance situation all this high profile Oval Office meeting here's some most of the country actually said play to\n\nDebate in a Second Amendment going on in the legal legal problems\nLegal ... we have a right to bear off\nThe problem is illegal guns he says\nNow you and I both know that that's that is established fact at this point that that is very clear the problem is is illegal guns legal gun owners\nAre actually not just a lesser criminal threat than your average American they also have the effect of reducing crime in ... re violent crime you can go read Jon lots more guns less crime for the in depth analysis through all the numbers on that\nUh what's your book plugs to people that are friends with the show but\nThe fact that he said this upsets oh many liberal they hate\nWhen anyone breaks ranks on the issue of guns because guns are such a a simplistic issue for stupid left wing Hollywood social justice warriors to feel like they're really brave and strong on\nAnd they live in this complete echo chamber of everybody knows that guns are so bad everybody wants to get rid of guns because guns kill people and they won't engage anywhere beyond that I mean I tried to talk to a list I'm Alone does of course the meat you leader we talk to her out in California\nAnd she said that if it's easy to buy an air Fifteen and just to buy a cappuccino Starbucks it's just a lie\nI mean if yeah if you had mandated federal background checks for all purchases

anybody else and you couldn't take your cappuccino you know a across state lines and you know you go to and there's just so yeah\nIt's like buying a cappuccino insofar as it's like buying something but there's a tremendous amount of other stuff that goes into it and I I Can't tell if it's that she's just not smart enough to know that\nOr she to self righteous and self involved to care and the end of the law is more effective but you see ... saying the problem is illegal guns that bothers ... what I what I realized more\nToday is that they don't want to ... it's not just at who he is and then he appeared withdrawing that he's just ... high profile black celebrity that'll bothers I'm sure but beyond that there's the issue of\nHold on a second he was saying things that upset liberals on policy he was saying things that were a shoot in many ways and that's where you get to oh they just want to shut down the messenger\nThey want to stop the message it's not just a a celebrity\nMake fun

called ... right but the first of all what do you think I said I I think if I send in the face and then gotten out of the right and you have any hair out\nYup yup\nSo happy learned how to put you know oh a quick question though yeah man I got a quick question for you were talking about the a job in the beginning of the segment\nA last week we had that um Obama clip where he talked about or his or one of the youth to hell he got in the fight than you were mentioning how you know probably going to happen um who would win and Obama Jeb Bush but\nLike if they stepped into the octagon put on the pads and actually that's a really that's a really a tough one yeah I mean I'm I'm into energy ... I I think I think Obama problem I think Obama\nProbably takes them I just think Jeb is just a wimp and like you know Obama's probably got some why restraint I think Obama but I Know everyone's Boeing you right now look I call it like I see it All right I call it like I see it\nA try to think of what would be will be some other fun ... octagon UFC style matchups with various pot well first of all binge drinking would take like any Democrat oh have you here with all the the GOP has got a lot more ringers for the octagon in their in their senior government ranks than uh\nYou know the than anywhere else I mean I can tell you this\nIf it were if it were between Biden let's say and fighting and McConnell\nI think would be interesting I probably think that by ... you know fights a little dirty huh but McConnell also has that you don't remember you ever have like your ... you ever look in the wrong side of your grandpa and felt like Rand Paul is kind of old but then he actually grab you real like oh my gosh grandpa was old men strike yeah\nI think that I got all my writing is ran I agree with that yeah do you have to do the turtles journals are all about surprised yeah snapping turtles look all slowing cute until you ask a finger that's how McConnell would fight flow and was that he went to the re he'd be all methodical and bite and you know\nI think so I think that's a fair point so we should do your records like it was like so these two politicians gotta gotta go fight who would come out on top oh you know be a great one cruise in ... oh yeah crews that are worth because\nWe got our ... we got that one a swamp fight club absolutely do you think about this do cruise\nTrip Jimmy Kimmel to school and the basketball court just took him to school\nAnd Kimmo was really ... a lot and if you see some of the video it was really trying hard and given thought he was going to win cruise but you know what cruise or about the fundamentals do just like he's all about the constitution when it comes to law and when it comes to basketball Cruz is all about like boxing out and I bet you in like a wrestling match\nCruise would go with like straight out of the book like double lake takedown arm bar you know half Nelson you probably studies all the maneuvers yeah\nYou know whereas beta unless unless you can you know knocked back a six pack and get into a car beforehand I don't think he's too dangerous right oh yeah All right how do you go I think the only way that\nYeah go ... what he got to say one thing I think we learned\nFrom the segment with that or whether it's in the arena of ideas are actually in the arena in a ring conservatives will always come out on top\nI think that's it I think that's a perfect place for us to leave us because that is that is in fact will take away\nOur team we've got more coming up actually my friend regime\nCrushed some will be joining us here in just a moment just talk about a whole bunch of things to receive

Nigel ... she's the author of no go zones\nYou see him running around Fox and other places making all kinds of trouble and making sense rain great to have you back\nGreat should be able to give people what they want but [noise]\nIndeed a man a man of the people don't want the ask Scott spoil you everybody now tell me about what's going on with a with the the regulation you know we like to get a view from the rest of the world ... her worldly fellow and you obviously are are Brits are so what's going on with peaches in the United kingdom [noise]\nWe we as you know we have a regular environment in Europe the United kingdom specifically\nA and the Democrats to God our help decided the pizza is the next talk of the uh there was an organization called public health England [noise] um it is the sort of watch dog and a regular feature in the United kingdom and they have now said\nAh the ah pizzas should be kept in the terms in terms of how many calories a should be sold a\nChicken ... cheese the toppings or what kind of thing um\nAnd plus the supermarkets played ... uh you know pizza delivery places things like that this is\nIn in governments woods their uh their attempt to a stem off and they'd be cautious and of course unfortunately whenever there was talk of obesity crisis fingers get pointed at the United states and say we don't want to be like them\nOr are we going to teach all concerned way on this I think is not just going to apply to a pizza buckets going to apply to a almost\nTake away portions labeled nine hundred and twenty calories\nIn any takeaway portion which would kind of restrict I think for the McDonald's menu written and and and so on and so forth [noise] um so it's it's it's it's been sort of the subject of quite a lot of jokes over the last twenty four hours won't get but unfortunately I'm it's entirely true er which makes us to jail\nAnd is the pizza and the u._k. anything that anybody really wants to eat let's be honest I have no idea I'm really asking\nBut [noise] I mean dominoes the best you can get in London do they have some pretty good pizza\n[laughter] your average your average Chicago where the New Yorker would not want to end by the London pizza um but uh but it's you know it's not a terrible uh you know I've I've had the pizza in England many many times in my belt line shows um but uh it's not just the heat is I mean think about the largest\nUh take away food product in the United kingdom is ... don't occur vibes lamb and could buy chicken ... I mean none of that would come in under nine hundred and twenty calories a fortune so when you add a lovely garlic sauce and all that stuff on top and the chips on the prize as you say on the side I'm so this is really actually going to\nI think hit a lot of people in their pockets quite seriously because they're not actually going to be less well they're gonna have to do is lose double portions\nAre always going to say they they they can't they're not making you have like a friend come with you so you can easily get one slice or one ... I think\nThey might ... we're not far off from having police officers in every state wave watching coach you're saying um but yeah I mean it it realistically speaking there's nothing to stop me going okay I'd like one slice of pizza place\nAnd then going back to the front of a lot of going and I'd like another slice of pizza place I mean maybe it's going to enforce that so it's going to be paying double it's going to be you know again this is this is regressive because who is that what is most of the takeaways backed she working class people\nPeople who work very hard long hours I have time to cook I'm so and so forth um so so you know we might joke about it but there are serious ramifications for this stuff at the same as\nAny government sort of regulation whether the energy tax or fuel taxes at all it's a the ordinary person in the pocket the hardest\nAnd tell me a bit about this story with with Amazon you brought this to my attention rain Amazon is giving money to do well some charities that folks should know about what's going on [noise]\nYeah this is quite this is really quite serious I mean Amazon has this program ... smile wearing it to a certain dates a portion of its profits are from anything you buy through through jak feeds off says\n[noise]\n\nAbout me too movement though do you believe in them do you support the me too movement [laughter]\nI support the ... and they need to be say we need to support them and you know ... not to the men\nDo you think man and then in the news that had been accused of a sexual assault sexual harassment had been treated unfairly\nAnd you have any hide everything thanks you know all kinds of something so that\nSomeone in my shoe that I say how could you say that this is troubling you hate to stand with women going\nBack to ... to selling album he could not to say to somebody I really you know sex and yes all attack\nOr even getting back to me why because sometimes you can't go too far down the raid Dave ... it's not clear actively try\nI got to tell you I it's amazing to me or maybe I shouldn't say it's amazing it's noteworthy to me that the first lady of the United states who's an immigrant to this country a very successful legal immigrant to this a country\nThat the first lady age or has a better understanding really the first lady of the better understanding of\nRule of law due process and the presumption of innocence than about Ninety percent of the mainstream media\nShe's like yeah I stand with women but like show some evidence you know we gotta have we got to have evidence I Know people who say oh but most of the time it's just an act it's just an accusation and well the truth is those accusations are generally anchored by the place the time\nThe reality of whether those people had had any contact were they in the same region where in the same city are you know there are there are allegations in their allegations\nYou know if I say that I uh met with\nSomebody who was part of some international conspiracy Thirty years ago I Can't tell you where or when but it happened\nThat's a lot less convincing that last week I met with a guy named Bob who is part of some big international conspiracy we met you know next to the Washington Monument and this was the time of day\nBecause by adding those details even if I'm just making that allegation it at least provides a context and it makes it either provable or disapproval theoretically prove or disprove will whereas if it's on more by the time or place you can't\nYou can't just prove it that's why the Ford allegations and I wrote that the Ford was a very disturbed person I mean I think the blog for probably has had\nAll kinds of terrible things happen to her I think she probably was a ... is almost certainly was sexually assaulted I just think almost certainly uh she is making up that it was Brett Kavanaugh or at least she's wrong about it being Brett Kavanaugh which would not be that strange for people with a thirty five year a memory gap\nSo or thirty five years ago and memory gaps in that\nShow here here we have this the first lady talking about the me too movement and and ... cents while talking about the me too movement and then we also have\nWhat does not make sense in this whole me too movement or what what does take things far beyond the realm of what any normal person uh would would be willing to say or think about an issue\nVictoria, BC shell brown got published in the Washington Post\nAnd\nThat the Washington Post would publish this I mean they consider themselves a serious newspaper okay they they think of themselves is probably the second most juries newspaper the country only does it you know only in the the number two slot for the New York times but they're a D.C based and so I'm sure they believe that they're even better than the times on a whole bunch of issues anyway\nHer piece is as follows quote same or this is a a professor or a college professor writing the Washington Post thanks for not raping us all you good men but it's not enough\nLet me take you a little bit into this piece my friend's quote\nI yelled at my husband last night not pick up your socks yell not how could you ignore that red light yell this was really yelling this was thirty minutes from the gut yelling triggered by a small thoughtless dismissive annoyed patronizing comment\nSmall a microwave that triggered a hurricane I blew hard and fast and it terrified me I'm Still terrified by what I felt in what I said\nI'm almost Seventy years old I'm a grandmother ... in that roiling moments screaming at my husband as if he represented every clueless mail on the planet\nAnd I every angry woman I'm twenty Eighteen I announce that I hate all men\nAnd wish all men were dead\nOne of my grandchildren yet you also think that ridiculous I'd have to say for a laugh but my husband and fifty years did not laugh he took a dead seriously\nUh okay this is pretty much a an overview of contemporary left wing feminism on display fish more or less a lays out for all of us why feminists are are\nLiberal humorless nasty angry and and destructive not just in the in the general conversations we have in society but really self destructive to\nThere is a bizarre self loading self pity yang and self righteousness at the heart of left wing feminism your victims but you're also warriors for for justice you know\nSocial justice warriors are you are sanctimonious all the time but you really just want to\nHave people treat you better ... which is that\nThis woman went into what I think you can call full on Harvey mode against her husband I think that's fair to say screaming at him more than she's ever seem to be for over what she says where they thoughtless comment and she thought she was channeling the anger of all women\nAnd then a whole piece by the way is about how it's not enough to just not attacked it's not enough to just treat women\nAbout us prevailing over in the fight I mean I I Know that you're an optimist about America as a my doctor gee but who\nWho or or most and menacing opponents going into the future\n[noise] ah it's look I came in as a general kind of you to look and feel good for national security when I joined the Trump Administration\nAnd my focus was of course kind of terrorism but once you get the clearances once you know reads a classified intelligence you realized very quickly that you know we're dealing with ISIS with your with Iran with dealing with North Korea we're going to put Russia back in her books\nUh Iran will be dealt with but there's only one truly strategic threat we face and that's a sign that China has a plan to displace America you could read it now so she could go on line and just punch in one belt one road and you will see the best strategy\nTo pose America as to become the most powerful nation of the world so number one if China but the good news is\nPresident Trump understands the threat and he is taking action\n\nWhat it what should we do these of each other and I mean clearly the president has stood up to them in an economic fashion that you know they're they're getting the worst end of this we've always been led to believe in recent years until Trump\nOr Dr ... that ... that this would be disastrous for us if we were to ever push back on China's not just currency manipulation and sets of intellectual property but all of their predatory business practices and the international scene Trump is already winning this battle what else does he have to do\nWhat we first we have the kind of educational component reacted disabuse\nFall off of the American ... especially those in Silicon valley that I\nChose not to Beijing of the communist this\nConcept that Kissinger sold a house that is absolutely fallacious that with more economic liberalize they showed a nation will eventually become a democracy it wasn't true in the Nineteen sixties or seventies and it's definitely true now me the idea that Google\nIs helping the Chinese government to censor the Internet from its own citizens that's outrageous we don't do that we don't support democracy does not wait for number one\nEducation number to exactly what the pros too during his trade investigations as Paris and at the end of the day you're right that China has far more to lose that we do so now is the time to redress the pilots\n\nWere speaking of doctors Sebastian Gorka author of the new book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and get it right now on Amazon and I recommend you all do show before I let you go Dr G A this show the business is looking increasingly macabre or this is a really\nBad situations no question about that looking more and more like the Saudis\nOr had the not just direct hand in this but it was the ... the the command training when what do you think the Trump Administration response should be to this\nIncredibly provocative and and really it seems just almost insane act of violence\nWell first the first we we made the facts of a case where you you know we need we need evidence of what exactly happened fan um he he himself he has a a check your background or if you look at his writing\nYeah she's an Islamist I was telling people this yesterday he's an Islamist which is not come out somehow and a lot of folks go ahead Dr geographic\nArea of favorite connections to the Muslim Brotherhood but clearly look this is an individual who was caught in the the great game the geopolitical um\nStandoff really between the two nations that wish to become the dominant\nA ruling nations of the Sunni Muslim world and that's the the yearly fee of traffic on democratic turkey and then the kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... Islam was founded so that's that's the geopolitical contacts and this man is\nWas I guess caught in the middle of that but but right now we're working with your thought these were going to find out what happened to the spot but you know better than anybody else but I mean you know [noise] background and in college and jumped out of all an initial reports from the battlefield must be verified\nSo let's find out exactly what happened to them you know the White House will be on the case\nObsolete I I've I've a friend the news business who said you know you read a report that was telling him that the body parts were buried the show the body parts were buried in the backyard of the consular official down the road I said you know before you go in there\nThat that news source you got it from is it by chance are funded by the country's is this is this the ... newspaper that's not really a free and fair oh and it turns out it is so you're absolutely right there's a lot of stories out there that you have to not just take with a grain of salt have to wait\nAnd see what the full because what they did the the Turks are becoming increasingly problematic for us too so it's this is not an easy\nSituation in terms of gauging all the different motivations for the different aspects of the story but well have you back Dr gee we got more on that one uh Sebastian Gorka everybody his book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies Dr Gordon I Will write it and I hope you'll come and join me on rising we'll talk with us on TV\nI look forward to it thanks for having me but\nShe got good luck with the book had a great weekend team we got a more coming up with ...\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where am I dated goes making all lined purchase or simply accessing your email could put your private information at risk\nYou are being tracked on line by social media sites marketing companies and your mobile Internet provider not only can they record you're browsing history but they often sell it to other corporations who wants to profit from your information\nThat's why I decided to take back my privacy by using express VPN\nExpressed the piano it's easy to use apps that runs team is in the background of my computer phone and tablet turning on express medium protection takes only one click protect yourself and express BBN it costs less than seven dollars a month\nYou were jak all your online activity today and find out how you can get three months free and express BBN dot com slash book that's express V.

and ah we just got word today well some good news is bad news about outer space [noise]\nThe good news is aliens have been found [noise]\nThe bad news is we can't afford to get um [noise]\nI'm not

Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon and twenty drifting you said the natural adjusted new spacecraft was called the crew expiration vehicle by two thousand eight and conduct the first mission no later than twenty forty\n\nWhere we are four years after the fact nothing we don't we don't have men men started back on the moon again we're we're just really talking about saving for speech to receive name even land on the movie industry go around the moon\nBut the President Bush had a goal set\nAbout being a man on the moon living and working there by twenty twenty having a base there and it's not out of the question I mean if you look at what Bigelow Aerospace is up to with\nMaking huge inflatable moon basically I could have been done even ... could've been done\nWell gee that was nine we were told the natural was carrying out this LCROSS experiment and they were lying to us about it about what they were using it for is that they were looking for ice in the ... there are plenty of missions prior to the moon landing plenty of missions like the Clementine mission where they were scouting out in the moon finding ice pockets\nAnd so they didn't need the LCROSS mission but uh\nOf course NASA had five hundred million to spend on a rocket was slamming\nThe moon blow up and then a cause of created it's about six miles wide and uh you know people say oh my God they're gonna new moon and they were going to do this two days or two days shy of the ... anniversary of the first landing on the moon\nAnd there was a lot of stuff about that mission that didn't add up didn't make any sense\nAnd\nTwenty love and after the LCROSS mission failed bronco Obama cut funding for the proposed constellation program and the space vehicles he he basically cancelled the five year nine billion dollar effort to build new Orion spacecraft in aries rockets\nThe new space vehicles were slated to replace the masses three aging space shuttles and launch astronauts into orbit and onto the moon that was the thing but no\nObama pulled the nine billion and they put the money towards data that climate change climate science so Obama killed the space program in order to turn announcing the climate change police and that's that's really sad I mean if there was ever a time\nBut now that we went to the moon at all that was the time because it you know they just dumping shut down here we have this dream or going forward then Obama says not\nNot doing that we're not going to go so here we are in twenty Eighteen and we'll begin been told that the moon is the goal and later Mars to news\nStories today that I Want to tell you about that really helped me excited but uh some bad news first of all a Russia seems to be out of their minds\nAh apparently may have detected would appear to me to colliding start\nAnd I think somewhere I have the sound that he started they'll try and dig it up but uh yeah they they detected these stars are putting off of sound gate of weird sound and are there going wait a minute or these really colliding stars are we looking at a space armada coming our way\nAnd if they are moving is asked we think they're going to be here by twenty twenty two\nI'm kidding I'm not kidding Russia families colliding stars\nThey start collecting stars and they before them out there saying well if these look like cutting stars but the sounds are giving us she may have intelligence in them so they may not be colliding stars at all\nWhat are they well they are um are there are no mater of of huge space craft coming our way\nUm\nNASA also reported today that Seventeen scientists often to report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national mission\n\nThe breathing was offered by the national academies of Science Engineering and medicine it emphasizes the importance including astrobiology the study about life rigid on earth and how it might evolve elsewhere in the University of every phase of all now submissions destined for space from inception conceptualization to planning to development and operation\nSo once again we have Seventeen scientists and guess what guys every mission that we do from now on is going to have the purpose of finding life out in space\n\nOnce again\nEvery mission is going to be about finding a life in space to have to have a a quest of a finding life in space Russia's says they picked up on to quote colliding stars but maybe a space armada heading our way\nSo I Believe that the reason why this is happening why they're saying hey every mission has to have a fact finding like giving whatever is because they have confidence that there's intelligent life out there and the recent reports of techno signatures in fast ... actually it's fast radio burst or the motivation behind the quest\n\nI don't know that it has anything to do with these ... stars are possible are modest coming our way but it certainly has a lot to do with the techno signatures and get this\nAstrophysicist are now saying\nThat with all the thousands of exoplanets out there and and how they're uncovering new insights into the complexity of diversity of life on earth the authors also sit in the briefing that not only are you going to be looking for techno signatures guys we want you to look for bio signatures\nSo this is pretty amazing don't you think I mean I think it's cool I mean this bolsters the chance at life could exist out there\nAnd therefore all space exploration missions should incorporate technology and find traces of alien organisms ... signatures techno ... I mean look our personal view of the universe is more crammed plants than ever before\nWe have two thousand three hundred confirmed exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission and that leads to efforts to six out of every ten stars could host Earth like planet so the sheer number of known exoplanets operas exciting opportunities for finding bio signatures fighting chemical markers\nIndicating that yeah there's live out in space\nIn the report sciences recommended that NASA accelerate the development of technologies to detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument that can travel to a distant world and measure the composition of its elements minerals and organic matter\nThe report also suggest that direct imaging systems that suppress star like should we use outside our solar system to improve detection of ... signatures from planets that might orbit those stars NASA could also play more missions that the peer under the surface of exoplanets\nWhether another rocked the icy or ocean worlds defined subterranean alien\nLife according to the report however [noise] effort is located are extraterrestrial neighbors either in our solar system are light years away [noise] we'll take more than technology alone and all of these advancements will cost money and guess what guys [noise]\nNASA's only plan to return astronauts to the moon after nearly fifty years just got slammed by an internal audits that means\nWe're not going to the moon anytime soon and we're not gonna look for aliens anytime soon [noise]\nWe're using ... and asked Johnson really excited about the possibility of life out there [noise]\nBut our rockets the F.

to the old\nStory about how there's probably some astronaut floating around in deep space somewhere in the Russian astronaut Cosmo died\nOh what happened to be sent my up into space and um Russia reported that uh the dog was doing okay you know dogs great out in space or being space where they didn't tell us is is that when it went through the Van Allen belts di da horrible death\nOr either to be coming back to the moon that's what I meant and so you know all about the reference to the Gemini program the Apollo program you know the death that happened before the testing but see a lot of people you know point to that\nDid that for Gus Grissom as the beginning of the conspiracy theory that we didn't go to the moon\nAmong Americans between Eighteen and twenty four years old twenty seven percent back in the Nineteen sixties expressed outfit NASA went to the moon over the years there have been many more people\nBut also stepped up and said I don't believe it's been the moon I don't believe that we went to the moon I Believe that a Hollywood has been telling us all the time that we haven't Stanley Kubrick directed the moon landings two guys want a space odyssey took time for bear did the moon landing stuff\nAnd of course we were ... showed in Nineteen Seventy one diamonds Are Forever James Bond film is James Bond gets on a moon landing set Nineteen Seventy eight Capricorn One movie the talks about men faking that the Mars landing spot a two thousand and one of Fox special conspiracy theory did we went on the mood basically\nSaying stating a fact that we never went to the moon Ben came by several film titled a funny thing happened on the way to the moon he claimed he at footage of the astronaut speaking the famous earth shot and\nUh it's it's in Israel and if you want to look as funny thing happened to the way to the moon and show the astronaut speaking beat the the famous blue\nEarth shot so you know there are plenty of things that can cast doubt plenty of things are getting cast doubt on whether or not the moon landing happen in two thousand for\nPresident George W. Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon to Ryan program the ... the crew exploration vehicle\nBy two thousand eight you know we're supposed to be a working towards going to the moon getting there by twenty fourteen normally no later than twenty Fifteen didn't happen why because in two thousand nine actually it was a two thousand nine round two thousand nine rock Obama pulled the plug\nBut uh it it was because of a a a failed mission that we had to go to the moon within Al Cross a rocket\nWill crater the ministry of there was water which didn't make any sense because we already had survey ears and landers and and orbiters mapped the moon Clementine actually mapped the moon in Nineteen Ninety four and a common side was able to deliver more than one point eight million digital images of the moon back to the ground\nAnd um\nThere was the interest satellite they were ground tracking stations are but they they were ... ground tracking satellite station was picking up on these images so everything is accessible to the general public via the Internet\nAnd one scientist reviewed the data from Clementine they already found the existence of ice\nWithin the moon's crater so why did they did as well you know it was a failure nonetheless you across mission was a failure Brock Obama pulled the funding from a vis a constellation Orion a project\nWhich kept us from going to the moon and a nine billion dollars is cut from the program and a ... now here we are in twenty team\nWe've been told the mood is the goal again\nAnd what's really cool is it today it was reported that Seventeen scientists often to report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national NASA mission there the briefing was authored by National Academy of Sciences engineering in medicine it says it says in the briefing and said that\nThere is very important\nThat the new NASA missions include\nA studies at astrobiology studies of how life originated on earth and how it might have evolved elsewhere in the universe and every phase of all NASA admissions destined for space from inception conceptualization they have to plan on trying to find a way to discover life in space\nAnd I think ... it's obvious the reason why they're saying is is because yes they have confidence that they found these techno signatures they found the grammatical waves are in fact Russian scientists ought to colliding starts thinking it was armada I played the tones of the stars coming out it's in the south\nArms all over the country so I won't be doing that again but um\nAnd in fact this awful arms of shutdown radio station so if I had that Arabs because of that ah\nBut in recent years we in the show has been discussing\nThat thousands of exoplanets and biologists were actually uncovering new insights to the complexity diversity of life on earth and and also a these discoveries would bolster and we was closer to the chance that life could exist on other worlds and therefore\nAll space X ray exploration missions now should incorporate technology to find traces of alien organisms\nSo you know with a number of exoplanets they've discovered with all the ideas about life on other planets scientists recommending that NASA accelerate the development of technologies\nTo detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument meaning there isn't anything ready now nothing that can fly on the space to take care of this problem nothing that can traveled to just do roads and measure the composition of its elements minerals organic matter that sort of thing so the report suggests\nThat direct imaging systems to suppress star like should be used outside our solar system to improved detection of ... ... signatures from planet that might or but those stars NASA also uh is being told that they can plan for more missions appear under the surface of exoplanets however\nThe average to locate extraterrestrials\nEither in our solar system are light years away is going to cost a lot of money and you need to advance technology to do it\nWell here's the deal NASA space launch system the S L F the new rocket they were putting together to go to the moon was supposed to be the the designed to go to the moon and then ... and then eventually go to Mars is a very powerful rocket\nApparently um it's running years behind a schedule is a lot of major cost overruns and it just got slammed by internal audit\nTwelve point two billion dollars to develop this launch system\nA Wednesday the auditors came in public to report highlighting problems with the work of NASA and Boeing and the report like sixty four million dollars in extra fees they were given a NASA they slammed the Boeing ... report from a poor performance and questioned the long term sustainability of the super rocket program\nAnd report even calls into question the sustainability of an entire project meaning that even with all the bright ideas and designs and the idea that we can go out and find aliens now this rocket won't even make it up and launch pad for years William and make it to the moon\nSo this whole newly manned moon project we're supposed to have going on by twenty twenty ... may not happen and also I don't think space forces going to happen either I mean so you know once again we have this movie first man\nBig old infomercial for NASA and they can't even get a rocket off the ground sure we can sit up satellites probes robots but the man to the moon with a new rocket yeah we can't do that don't know how any more I mean we're going to do what we were going to do it\nIn twenty Fifteen\nBut Barack Obama made that go away and it was you were still supposed to send them out of the moon by twenty twenty\nAnd NASA will not even be able to do that [noise]\nThe lawn must companies rebuild the first private citizen to be sent around the moon but guess what [noise]\nWell my brother is working on the project it was the shuttle project since its inception F didn't want to start a company and they got the ground test contracts for all the systems on the air Ryan tribal inside and\nWell it'd be a Ryan goes up that doesn't mean we're going to the moon see that's the thing is I Want a guy I Want a man on the moon before I die\nThat's that's what I Want to see I don't think I'm going to see it and it sucks because\nI I thought I'd be go to the moon as you said earlier yeah it it was just\nKind of that kind of twisted me quite a bit\nYeah well it hurts me enough to have my doubts that's all I got to say [noise] but they are going thank\nYou I mean if I found out tomorrow that we did go to the moon and they could\nProve to me beyond doubt I'd shut up about it but no there's no I haven't\nSeen anything yet that convinces be we went to the moon only\nTV and believe me they can do a lot of things with TV\nAnd a lot of things they did was be fooled

about that\nAnd turns out it was a reminder of what we face on the left but\nI think that the Kavanaugh debacle for the left was really just in a sense the last straw\nThat has pushed them over the edge but they were already heading in that direction and these\nThese symptoms of the mass delusion of leftist that are manifesting themselves with these Matt a masters in these mobs coming together and screaming and yelling and this mob mentality and on and the\nReally the lack of ability on the media's part just set the narrative the way they want you in the air rage which comes out now more on there I think it's because they realize\nTrump is winning he's still\nWinning they haven't been able to take him\nOut of office with this Russia collusion investigation nonsense\nThey haven't been able to sing came with Republicans or you know anybody who's persuadable anybody who's open minded about this with all the different allegations of twenty Fifth Amendment and uh the investigations of his finances I mean the New York times did I think it was a twelve thousand\nWord essay\nOn Trump's taxes stretching back to his father's taxpaying practices in the seventies\nI think there's some stuff about him in the sixties in there I mean they they went way way deep into was and I read this piece I thought to myself this is this just kind of like the scene and John Nash\nShowed that John Nash hasn't a Beautiful Mind when he's got all the crazy riding on the wall of this stuff all the formulas in the wall and you and then you realize oh\nThis person has a problem the media has a problem\nFrom maybe has caused it but they're the ones with the problem\nThey are no longer objective in all of this and now it looks very likely that the Republicans are going to keep the Senate and they have a fighting chance and people are saying it's a twenty five percent chance I'm telling you I think it's more like fifty fifty right now that the GOP can hold the house\nAnd what will liberal save them and they they really going to all of a sudden you know to discover that oh Russia manipulated this election true is that going to be the play it might be but I don't think they have any real belief that that will that will stick to that will work\nWhat do they tell themselves now I Know that they comfort themselves with the constant refrain from his race is Trump is a is a sexist sexual assault or a a traitor a crazy person all these they say all these things\nBut what do they tell themselves about the politics of this country when the president did they say is the worst president of all time which is a pretty common thing you hook you'll hear on the left the worst president while time unfit for office should be removed from office\nBecause of his his temperament and his judgment in the way that he is doing his job they say he should be removed for that reason\nAnd it turns out he's doing a really good job\nThe economy is chicken but and I'm here in for a lot of people who know and this is their life's work has studied is that\nEven though there's this sense right now oh maybe we have what Greenspan would've called irrational exuberance of oh my gosh things are so great they're just gonna keep getting better and better some people have that a lot of people have the oh it must get worse it must get work will get worse but they've been saying\nThat as you get worse last Eighteen months and it has it\nSo what do they help themselves what did they come away with\nAnd this then brings me to the outrage mobs anti fall and the uh you know the the the women's march\n... and the anti Kavanaugh hordes and the the stalkers because that's really what we're talking about these stalkers who are activists that try to find Republicans to harass them to frighten them to scare them away at a Republican who put a block slap\nSome hallway stalkers today we'll get to him later\nThey've high five bugs issues increasingly looking like the last is going to have\nTo live and Trump's America for many many years to come and I don't know how they're going to to handle that I don't know how they're going to deal with this is why I've been so worried recently about the possibility of real violence\nBecause they've already gone to the mat they've already taken the dial to eleven they are doing everything everything conceivable in terms of propaganda and organizing and media effort and they're doing everything they can just stop this political movement that Trump is a part of from\nFrom reaching its its intended goals from doing what it has set out to do from the beginning and they can't stop it and I think that what shed in with many of them is is not just a a panic but also a sense of helplessness\nIn the last must be telling them so we thought we were going to get this guy gone with the ... we thought we were going to get this guy gone with any number of different ploys and if we couldn't get him going at least we could we could stop him and have you know Americans turn on him and have a base turned on him\nAnd the opposite is happening I\nAm more confident in this president and what he's doing and his yes his message as well as his policies\nWith each passing month what does that mean for the last how did they try to rebound from this how do they try to come up with some counter narrative I\nDon't hear it yet all I hear as rage annoys and anger and if this continues on if they don't have any real counterpoint to counter punch for what Trump is doing\nI worry about what their next move will be because I Know that it will not be rational and it will not be in the best interest of this country that we know for sure\nI I tend to think that we could be facing some kind of October surprise along the lines of what they did with cabin on the very end of the nomination process it's not enough that they don't have anything they'll manufacture\nSomething they will create whole call some means of trying to take take the the Trump Administration down a few notches at least enough that they have a successful midterm election I Can't tell you I Know what it is I don't\nOkay he is the commander in chief he's the president and when things like this happen high level US government negotiations and in this kind of desirable outcome you have to be willing to say okay we we give the president some credit for this one\nUm we get their president credit and then there's also what's been going on with China here's Larry Kudlow play fourteen\nI just would hope\nWould show greater appreciation\nFor the asked\nThat President Trump has been making\nA with regard to blows markets are with regard to a ... with regard to force transfer of technology there are structural issues technology dishes right get with family jewels there's no reciprocity I'm trading and terrorists so there's a whole menu of things\nAnd I hope they get around to talking about it and perhaps the Chinese will be a little more um cooperative\nAnd with that whole menu of things by the way they could low brings up those have been problems for for decades but other administrations didn't even try to fix those problems other administrations just allow them to continue on why oh we\nWe can't mess with China someone give us a reason for that\nWhat's the explanation for why we can't mess with China\nThey're not Texas right don't mess with Texas a ... suffering in silence was a better option know Trump is taking on that are taking on that whole slew of problems\nAnd could loews right you know the Chinese government needs to be brought into line here and it's going to require some pushing it's not an easy thing to do but Trump is taking on things that are important without regard you well is this the simplest route\nObama showed his what eight years of sitting back relaxing and not really doing very much in thinking you're brilliant for that uh when it comes to foreign policy he showed us what that results in on the world she knows a lot of strategic patience leading from behind a lot of fancy ways of saying\nDon't make any decisions just focus on the process lots and lots of processed lots of talk\nWell turns out that if you are willing to tackle heart problems and make tough decisions you could accomplish things in the world stage that's the Trump approach on the economy on foreign policy [noise] just the Trump for a job that you could almost say identifying a problem and taking action to fix it is the Trump doctor [noise]\n\nFox News I'm Carmen Roberts the American pastor just released from Turkey's expected at the

Nineteen\nBut I I just\nWould love to think that enough people have been paying attention and realize what a scam this whole thing is what a deep state soft coup disgraceful pile of garbage this whole effort to stop and undermined and remove all of these things\nPresident Trump has been\nKnow there was a a story there was something that I didn't get a chance to tell you a better in the week the Mueller probe he hears the kind of stuff we actually get from this\nAnalysis with with no degree in psychiatry never meeting Tanya but just watching this on the news you had a lot of analysts talking about this one to the White House feel like this was a pretty big success all things considered\nSo the White House staffers I mean the ones who are most concerned with policy or all obviously a bit annoyed by it because they\nSaying you know why is the president and detracting away from his great week with Brett Kavanaugh but the ones who are a bit more culturally attuned to know that you know more Americans saw that clip with Kanye eight and anything else at the end of the day you know if you were to go around and\nAt at somebody like universal studios like they used to duty on on ... on late night shows and be like who's Brett Kavanaugh most people are not going to be able to tell you but I can guarantee you people saw that clip with Kanye West so from the president's\nPerspective he's using the star POWER UP Kanye in order to talk about you know talk about criminal justice reform it really was kind of a kind of a hilarious moment\nIn the oval office although it was funny to be behind the scenes I was in the at the White House while all that was occurring and I saw that the pool they select group of reporters that day\nCome out from the oval office and they were just I mean they were blown away you could see it on her face and they were just\nSaying this was wild one of the camera guy told me than the thirty years' that he's covering the White House Thirty Years' day to day it never seen anything like it\nI can believe that [laughter]\nThat's probably I think that's probably as a safe bet uh what are we expecting tonight at Trump's out in Ohio I mean he's he's kind of the secret weapon on the campaign trail for the G O P hadn't into the midterms isn't it\nYeah I mean the the amount of coverage and scrutiny that his rallies get it's just an automatic boon to any candidate who\nIs running because the people who have actually told me that for other campaign that one of the things they love about when the president comes as you get national TV coverage you know when does and that last time that\nAge you know some house candidate in uh Ohio six\nIs going to be getting into ... major Fox News viewership and and the president directly plugging him that helps with their donations it helps with their brand awareness it's free media it's one of those things that the president or the president loves doing relatively using the bully pulpit\nTo push candidate in terms of what he's going to say I have a pretty good idea they were he he's been having the same campaign rally now for basically the last two weeks almost every single night\nHe's got one tonight he's got one tomorrow night he's had one I think five nights prior and it it just it's a it's an hour long its rockets he talks about the flag he talks about his record North Korea he loves to bring people inside the room and it just it's a very high energy environment\nYeah I certainly picked up that there is no low energy Jeb vibe at the Trump rallies that is that is absolutely the case\nOf ... what are we what are we expecting by the way on on the policy side for for next week is there anything that that that you think is going to get up on the radar either from the White House side or do we know if they're really going to ... or ... rather some of those documents and Trump talked about that anything that we should be prepared for this coming week\nYou know I I I don't think that there's much that we should look for just because lawmakers are all out on the campaign trail they were desperate\nThat last ... last night to push through those judicial nomination so the Senate could go home everybody's focused on reelection that being said uh you know in terms of ... that's something I you know I've been asking a lot of questions about at the White House\nKnew at president about that right I mean you ask them about the reactions the oval\nYeah absolutely I I after a week before you did I think and and and I you know that's something that we've both been interested in but the\nIssue is that he has he had to take the issue over to the inspector general and I asked their standards about that in the last press breathing that we had and she refused to commit to a timeline of before the midterms so for\nNow I don't think we're going to be seeing anything in terms of those on redacted documents and I really don't expect you know knowing the inspector general horror with ... he is is very uh very cognizant of of dropping things and politically sensitive times and he does take quite a long time in order to do these reviews so it's probably not coming anytime so\nWhat's the best part of being a White House correspondent in the White House all those are\nThe best part is just being able to ... to be there upfront to get to get yelled at by hitting rock like we were yesterday or somebody said one of our what our colleague we we were just standing there I mean you're you're standing there waiting for these people to come in and you shot questions at a\nAnd a ... somebody asked him Mr Iraq which I thought it was funny to all of this rock and is it Mr rock are you going to fire or do you think Trump should fire Jeff Sessions and he said he should fire all of view before [laughter] [laughter]\nThat's amazing so by the way you know usually as a as a as a New Yorker and as a journalist I feel like you've always got to take the um you\nKnow act like you've been there before attitudes all things so I I Would very rarely be like oh here's a here's a person of of prominence let me take a selfie with him I Would judge no one for going up the kid rock ... this kid right [laughter]\nYeah exactly it's it's it's like that's it day to day stuff it's you know oh Jim brown is here kid rock is here ah you know Tom Brady Rob Gronkowski or you get to meet people and talk to people that you you'd never your wildest dreams\nWill be able to do and then at the other on the other hand you also get to talk to the president the United states and you get to ask him questions on the most consequential issues of the day so\nIt's got to be the most fun president in on history to get to have a conversation with him and I know you were in the old recently I Will be over ... recently ... it's a it's like the Trump show you really don't interview him so much as you try to guide this this one man phenomenon as he is speaking\n[laughter] yeah it really is a force of nature and and it's like you said you you you you you'll throw something out there and he'll latch onto it and then he'll he'll flip it around three hundred and sixty degrees and then go another one eighty in another direction and you you try and flipping Ninety two a little bit of where you want to go and you just see what a give\nAnd that that really is exactly how you say it it's it's\nWe we love to tell you know and the press it it's just one of those things where you can always get an honest answer out of Trump it it's it's hilarious\nI think yesterday or two days ago somebody asked him\nAnd said have you talked to the Saudis about you know this\nCurrent situation with this is missing journalist probably murdered journalist and he just said I don't want to say that yes [laughter] [laughter]\nWell\nYou know who did you talk to you that I don't want to say but at a very very high level and he just starts going into all of the the discussion there is the most you know what you see on TV is absolutely what you get in person\nOr on but once again every one favor soccer can you spread the word over at the Daily Caller where you are the White House correspondents ... bucks accent as an open challenge to anyone on you\nPong table there can only be one and I think I Will come out of the ... gone to Victor\nOkay yeah I read that where it's

understanding of\nRule of law due process and the presumption of innocence than about Ninety percent of the mainstream media\nShe's like yeah I stand with women but like show some evidence you know we we gotta have we got to have evidence I Know people who say oh but most of the time it's just an act it's just an accusation and well the truth is those accusations are generally anchored by the place the time\nThe reality of whether those people had had any contact were they in the same region within the same city are you know isn't there are there are allegations in their allegations\nYou know if I say that I uh met with\nSomebody who was part of some international conspiracy Thirty years ago I Can't tell you where or when but it happened\nThat's a lot less convincing that last week I met with a guy named Bob who is part of some big international conspiracy we met you know next to the Washington Monument and this was the time of day because by adding those details even if I'm just making that allegation\nIt at least provide the context and it makes it either provable or disapproval theoretically prove or disprove will whereas if it's unmoored by the time or place you can't you can't just prove it that's why the Ford allegations and I wrote I thought was a very disturbed person I mean I think the lousy for probably has had\nAll kinds of terrible things happen to her I think she probably was a ... is almost certainly was sexually assaulted I just think almost certainly uh she is making up that it was Brett Kavanaugh or at least she's wrong about it being Brett Kavanaugh which would not be that strange for people with a thirty five year a memory gap\nSo or thirty five years ago and memory gaps in that\nShow here here we have this the first lady talked about the me too movement and and ... cents while talking about the me too movement\nAnd then we also have what does not make sense in this whole me too movement ah what what does take things for beyond the realm of what any normal person\nUh would would be willing to say or think about an issue\nVictoria be shell brown got published in the Washington Post\nAnd\nThe Washington Post would publish this I mean they consider themselves a serious newspaper okay they think of themselves is probably the second most serious newspaper in the country only to the you know only in the number two slot for the New York times but there are D.C based and so I'm sure they believe that they're even better than that the times on a whole bunch of issues anyway\nHer piece is as follows quote same ever this was a ... a professor or a college professor riding the Washington Post thanks for not raping us all you good men but it's not enough\nLet me take you a little bit into this piece of my friends quote\nI yelled at my husband last night not pick up your socks yell not how could you ignore that red light yell this was really yelling this was thirty minutes of from the gut yelling\nTriggered by a small thoughtless dismissive annoyed patronizing comment\nReally small a microwave that triggered a hurricane I blew hard and fast and it terrified me I'm Still terrified by what I felt and what I said\nI'm almost Seventy years old I'm a grandmother in that roiling moments screaming at my husband is if you represented every clueless meal on the planet and I every angry woman up twenty Eighteen I announced that I hate all men and wish all men were dead\nOne of my grandchildren yet you also need that ridiculous I'd have to save all laugh but my husband uh fifty years did not laugh he took a dead seriously\nUh okay this is pretty much a an overview of contemporary left wing feminism on display fish more or less a lays out for all of us why feminists are are\nLiberal Schumer lists nasty angry and and destructive not just in the in the general conversations we haven't society but really self destructive to\nThere is a bizarre self loading self pity ing and self righteousness at the heart of left wing feminism your victims but you're also warriors for for justice you know\nSocial justice warriors are you are sanctimonious all the time but you really just want to have people treat you better well you know weight which is that\nThis woman went into what I think you can call full on Harvey mode against her husband and I think that's fair to say screaming got him more than she's ever screamed and before over what she says where they thoughtless comment and she thought she was channeling the anger of all women and\nThen a whole piece by the way is about how it's not enough to just not attack it's not enough to just treat women well and not be a sexist you have to form a male pro feminist movement\nVicious classic progressive social justice theory I Would know they say this about racism to it's not enough to just not be a racist personally you're responsible for historical racism as a white male and therefore you must actively work against it oh that means being a progressive doesn't it\nBut I I really tell you to read this piece thank you for not raping us good men but it's not enough and get a real window into the mindset of these radical deeply unhappy deeply troubled so-called feminists [noise]\nEveryday I start the same way with a delicious hot cup of black rifle coffee [noise]\nThis is so good my friends that I don't even need the ad in the ...

joined the Trump Administration\nAnd my focus was of course counter terrorism but once you get the clearances once you know reads a classified intelligence you realized very quickly that you know we're dealing with ISIS with your with Iran with dealing with North Korea we're going to put Russia back in hopes box\nOr Iran will be dealt with but there's only one truly strategic threat we face and that's a sign that China has a plan to displace America you could read it now it's no secret go online and just punch in one belt one road and you will see best strategy\nTo pose America to become the most powerful nation of the world so number one it's China but the good news is\nPresident Trump understands the threat and he is taking action\n\nWhat what should we do these of each other and I mean clearly the president has stood up to them in an economic fashion that you know they're they're getting the worst end of this we've always been led to believe in recent years until Trump\nOr Dr ... that ... that this would be disastrous for us if we were to ever push back on China's not just currency manipulation incentive intellectual property but all of their predatory business practices
