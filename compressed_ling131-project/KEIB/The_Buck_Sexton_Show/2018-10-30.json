Avon so I took advantage of it which is stupid in hindsight\nYou know I'd sell them but after the reason I Want to sell it is because you wouldn't buy it again\n\nIt's also for the same reasons you wouldn't buy it again you wouldn't keep it by the way you can apply that decision making tool to almost anything if you got a boat sitting in the yard that you never used and you look up and go you're not never buy another boat then so that one\n'cause you don't use it you know for the same reasons you wouldn't buy another one you saw that one and that's true of investments that is true of rental properties true of a lot of stuff if you wouldn't buy it again\nThen don't keep it a cause by keeping it tomorrow you bought it again in a sense so I think you take the offer or get a really sweet offer up the off or whatever but uh dumping I definitely do but\nNot only is in Little Rock Arkansas Hi Natalie welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nPatty how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm how do you mean situation here I'm really not sure what you're going to tell me today but we're working through your plans for the baby ... baby step to I'm paying off that\nSo we only have one dollar emergency pot and and the only thing that we have to pay off is my car which I just discovered you recently and her six months ago and it was I really needed a new vehicle we did the damn thing and buying a brand new\nCar so I have a lot on my car about thirty five thousand dollars good lord yeah well I'm about ...\nLess than a week ago I was involved in a pretty big car accident and that cars now total okay luckily we actually bought that GAP insurance to cover the difference between a\nAwesome when you're out awesome that were that free yeah the yeah hey but we\nOnly have

does it\nHit the two thousand eight yeah I don't know a GMC Truck has on strike good good okay they paid for all right\nGood wow uh I'll tell you what I did when I was in the same situation one time\nI rented a car for a month while I saved up the money to buy a car I'll bet you could say five thousand dollars a month yeah probably so and then by five thousand dollar car and drive it for six months or four months while you save up a bunch more money and get your Fifteen or twenty thousand dollar car and pay cash for it\nOK so rent for one month by five thousand\nThen okay then drive it for four or five months and by your Fifteen or twenty thousand all with cash\nOkay because I don't borrow money anymore\nRight well we also we consider the armchair and talked about it or super thrilled about it but we have a four O. one K. that no\nNo no money anymore okay we don't borrow money well okay if you borrow money on four one K. it's a debt you borrow money\nIs that borrowing it er yeah it's borrowing casting or do you if\nYou should have actually been worse if you catch it out they're gonna charge you a ten percent penalty plus thirty five percent on your taxes that's a that's borrow money at forty five percent interest effectively to bought\nBy a car I Know yeah I did I didn't know that those were the face yeah terrible okay horrible you know they\n... and lets you got something even sell rot faster gaining show real fast\nNo not not valuable enough to come back or less\nThan rent the cheapest thing you can rent or are you you're working on some\nI Know I'm not you're not\nI stay home with my kids okay I've got three kids so\nOkay how long can you make it without a car\nI Can't make it a day with that I really can't get my husband and his hours I'm like

costing\nWell with my my insurance is covering it right now so how long it would cover it for probably about another week maybe\nGood good just milk that all the way out right okay and then find you the least expensive rental you can get for one month\nOkay that'll get the job done please don't rent something super nice\nYou know [laughter] I'm not in a non fiction I thought I'm partly just try to keep it I've got because it works OK\nIf it's not it's not super because the more you spend on the real the less you concerned about better car right\nRight but you just need a little five thousand dollar get around than a little mini van just something that runs yeah for just a little walk 'cause you make a ton of money yeah and you've been broke for long enough for you to be in broke if there'll be broke visual how to fix it but if you go back and start doing normal people stuff you're going to be broke\nAgain you know normal people do\nYeah they go by another thirty five thousand dollar car prove that they were stupid the first time that is what normal people to don't don't don't borrow money you are not that desperate and you are not that media and you are not fed entitled you're none of those things\nIf you are you're going to be broke again you're going to be normal people ... people were broke ... title in ... and you're not entitled you're more than ... something into your ... and then move up and pay cash for\nI'm as an American listen to this I Know that you feel the same way\nThat any of us would do anything in our power to prevent this kind of a master from happening to help anyone who was a caught in such a horrific circumstances this and now we do what we can with in some cases direct aid and assistance but also just just prayer\nAnd ah and words of support and everything else that we can do\nFor the Jewish community in this country\nAnd yet it immediately turns into a political issue\n\nAnd without a moment self reflection without taking just to be sure let the American people more than they make this about Trump these people who\nDo this every day on every issue at all times are are sick they have a problem they really do there are no longer capable of being objective last week we were told\nThat there was a bomber who Trump is responsible for because this guy would already called it a bomb threat you know over a decade before Trump's presidential run and had a a a career criminal clearly you know psychological problems\nBut Trump's responsible because he criticized as people in the political arena and those are the people that were being targeted\nThey can't point to Trump ever ... ever inciting or or calling for violence against any of those individuals\nBut they say that Trump is basically responds well did they use these kind of weasel words\nThey'll say oh well he's he bears some share of the blame and you know 'cause they know the Trump didn't pack the bombs himself you know Trump wasn't wasn't crushing a glass to use the shrapnel for they're not that crazy I suppose they're not that stupid but they'll say that Trump was the reason for this in some way\nAnd what the point you as well he had his van this guy had this van say oc\nCovered in Trump's stickers covered in all this pro mug up paraphernalia\nAnd so we had to deal with this last week we talked about on the show now here we are over the weekend there's this terrible shooting on on Saturday on on the Jewish Sabbath\nAnd\nWe are told that even though this shooter it is clear did not like Trump because specifically\nTrump was too friendly and chew favorable and too much of a friend to the Jews it still Trump's fault\nNow if we take this theory at face value this theory that Trump has just raised hate in America let's be clear that means that not Trump is responsible no matter who in gauges in a hate crime against anyone else you know if there is an anti Christian an anti Catholic\nYou know hate crime in this country let's say you know ... or ... you know if there's if there's an Islamist extremist let's just put it this is a jihadist kills a bunch of people in his that Trump's fault\nI Want to know where the lines are drawn here and I think the answer by the way they would claim it's Trump's fault because you see somebody from the Islamic community if they were to radicalize it would be because of Trump's anti Muslim rhetoric so he would bear some of the share of responsibility for that too\nIf they you know neo Nazi white nationalist kill somebody somewhere at Trump's fault because he has implicitly encourage them they'll say\nIf a anti Semite who is anti Trump or they you know good on this list doesn't matter who does Trump is always responsible no matter what the situation if it's a terrible circumstance if there's violence and bloodshed here in America\nAnd there's there's hate and there's venom and there's nastiness addicts at the root of it all it is Trump's fault they say this is delusional\nAnd it's really destructive to how can you have a conversation with somebody about Trump's policies when they really believe that he's dog whistling to white supremacist all the time in ways that\nI Can't even begin to fathom\nI I I'm paying attention to politics all day I'm hearing the swamp I this is I live in brief politics and national security and I have no idea what some of these other pundits and and ... and such you're talking about sometimes no I'm like what are they\nWhat it will play something for you later you know here's what is that even me who are these idiots\nWho's paying so much to be so stupid on TV all the time and so they they talked about division as they are creating divisions I mean this is how you know that the left cannot be taken seriously on this\nThey will try to escalate rhetoric\nWhile saying that rest a rhetoric needs to be de escalated they'll say the reason we have terrorism and hate in this country is because of Donald Trump so Donald Trump needs to stop saying that the other side is bad\nOh\nThat seems like a brilliant idea for Trump why not just caved your political opponents\nLet them beat you in just admission bludgeon\nYou into silence on issues that matter to you by attaching all these issues all these problems all this violence\nNothing to do with\nTheir calling President Trump and anti Semite any President Trump grew up in New York City\nHe's served as did I which is a city that has I Believe the largest Jewish population anywhere outside of Israel in the world\nFrom his is has had countless friends who are Jewish his personal lawyer Michael Cohen I Know they've had a falling out but you know he was Jewish his son in law's Jewish you mom could convert to Judaism is grandkids are Trump is not an anti Semite\nNot even a little bit not even close but they say this the media says they\nPat themselves on the deck oh that's right yeah we're speaking truth to power know you're a bunch of destructive little individuals that are saying this\nIt's immoral to make these planes it's immoral to call someone an anti Semite was blood on his hands because somebody else\nWho hates the president who despises his position for Jews decides\nTo be violent engages in this in this river K crime and he's now facing the death penalty and good this guy should get the death penalty for what he he did and that's in a guy trying to track attached to this though it's\nJust so intellectually dishonest each show unfair and it\nJust goes to show you that there is there's no effort in good faith there is no let's have a real you know last week was all okay let's let's tone things down let's have a different a different kind of conversation going for let's talk about policy let's come together as Americans All right you know the press is under assault by the press drives\nI I agree with Trump and that the press does drive a lot of this because the press is full of a bunch of preening self obsessed self righteous jerks not all of\nStarting to take these incredibly violent because everyone agrees with this guy did was discussing the president's ... everyone has said it but I think there is something else going on on the left\nWhere they seem to think that this kind of intimidation is warranted because they think that Trump is a fascist because Trump is destroying the country because Trump is undermining our institutions that is the rhetoric that's coming from the top of the Democratic party enemy the apparatus Iran's all the time when\nYou're\nAll of that is true then by all of it reiterate all of it\nRepeating all of it I mean it it is what needs to be said here in this moment do\nOh we'll need to come together really easy to come together here's like well here's what they put on\nTV over at MSNBC the\nPolitics editor here's where he has to say about Trump when we're all supposed to come together now play twenty four\nAs much as I may have criticisms of how law enforcement operate in this country they are still our line of defense against maniac some terrorists out there but but I I have to face nickel and this has always been a problem with this president he has always shown a sympathy or a dismissive this towards terrorism\nOr he is a is a a terrorist sympathizers or I mean given the way that he responded what happened in Charlottesville given how he responded because she'll be given the fact that he he puts what's happened today and through this week and the concept of how it affects the midterm elections we don't have leadership\nIn this country when it comes to domestic terrorism this president foment but uh as much as he is occasionally forced to speak against it a\nTerrorist sympathizers MSNBC politics editor calls the president of United States how much more stupidity do we have to really be subjected to before we just so you know I I just don't want to hear from these from these idiots anymore I just I just can't I Can't I Can't even pretend to engage and here there are arguments\nI I feel this from friends of mine they say I'm just sick of it and I understand the feeling sometimes\nYou know and I spend a lot of time driving a lot of left us and it is it is no easy task these days you know what this really comes down to and this is what they don't want to tell you they know that they are not going to win the Senate and they know that the house is going to be tight and the left is aware\nSomewhere deep down that if Trump was anywhere near this monster this caricature that they've been saying for all this time\nThen Trump should get blown out his party should get blown out in the midterms right it should be wipe out in favor the Democrats what does it say that almost two years into the Trump presidency who they say is a traitor and a fascist in a bigot and a rapist and all these horrible things what does it say\nThat the party that has led by that guy\nIs going to gain Senate seats and almost even though it's an off year election hold on to\nThe house of representatives\nHow much more out of touch and diluted can the Democratic party be that's the question they don't want to have to do it's just so much easier for them so much more satisfying to say that it's just all about how Trump is a race just in a terrorist sympathizers [noise] just not true [noise]\nBut then five thousand troops to support homeland security operations at the U.S Mexico border that move comes as several thousand Central American migrants hope to seek asylum once they reach the border by the end of the year they\nAre not supposed to be coming into contact with migrants and with protests are they are not there and law enforcement capacity their engineers say our medical personnel and they're providing air left for customs and border patrol agents Fox's\nJennifer Griffin at the Pentagon White House press secretary Sarah Sanders today rejecting concerns the President Trump's rhetoric could inspire some of the domestic terrorists actually seen in recent days\nIs outrageous that anybody other than the individuals who carried out there from like hold that responsibility\nThe president was on Twitter today calling for an end to the fake news media which he calls the real\nEnemy of the people this is Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bug sex is that [noise]\nAnd that's what the rhetoric is doing is giving\nA people a license or certainly unbalanced people certainly people on the fringes of American Life but it is telling them that what you're doing a is okay and that's why yes there are always been an anti Semitic incidents in American history\nNationalism go hand in hand with anti senators have the entire idea of anti Semitism is to put ... outside the body politic outside the death of ... of ... and that's like Donald Trump guys that his fame that's what his party is now committed dealing\nElimination as rhetoric and the president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point he doesn't dog whistle teams as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence directly\nDirectly leading to violence they say it is not\nSomewhat or partially Trump's fault I mean I saw a a an editorial about this over the weekend in the Washington Post no less saying that\nUh it is directly somewhat you know that they'll always put his qualifier it's Trump's fall to an extent\nYou know or you know drug Trump's you to hold some some level of of the blame here uh this is this is disgusting it's disgraceful but when you have the individuals in the media who\nHave taken Trump's entire presidency so personally and as an affront to their greatness and their values and how wonderful they are are there are no limits really on the Bible that they will throw at this present there are no there's no good faith there is no decency whatsoever that they will extend to him an angel supporters\nTo all of us remember it's not just about Trump underneath all of this there's always this\nEvening hatred of the Trump voter to oh that's a part of the anti Trump movement they they despise the voters they don't cause they don't think that really we've been fooled\nThey have figured out enough now I Believe the left is in the media and the Democrat Party have figured out that we've made this bargaining were good with it were like yeah I like Trump I I Know he's not perfect I Know we make mistakes but I think Trump is actually the right choice for America right now so they hate us\nBecause of all of that and that's why they feel completely justified and saying just the most despicable disgusting things I mean here's here's a another Washington Post personal over at MSNBC play three\nThere's always been the old right or its equivalent the differences it was always on the French and the mainstream elements of the party and certainly the president's ah never validated that\nUh what's happening what so extremely dangerous about this is you now have the man with the largest megaphone in the world\nGiving a nod in a way sometimes outright praying [noise]\nAh to the folks who are carrying on these conspiracy theories and it is telling them these people that it's okay that they're getting a a blessing to do this\nYou know it's it's interesting that that he can go on TV that Dana Milbank Washington Post and say that Trump gives them a blessing right after he is explicitly openly repeatedly condemned this\nBut you see this is one of the games that they play they'll say why doesn't Trump why didn't Trump condemn white nationalist\nAnd people will say okay well he did he just condemned them a couple of days ago well well he hasn't denounced it enough and then people will do a little Google surgery and will say well we're on a second Trump has called white nationalist losers he said there's no place in America for hate and he said this many many times and they'll say well\nThe ... from talk about white nationalist so much you can't win folks you you know it's there's nothing he can do that will make them stop\nCalling him a racist stop calling him a white nationalist\nThey they do not extend the most basic level of good faith do them in any of these discussions and and\nYou are the ones who willfully violate the meaning of a dream that is America [noise]\nAnd this country because that's what it stands for\nWill not stand for your comment the [noise]\nThe greatest president my lifetime with the possible\nException of Donald Trump will see how it how it goes we'll see how many years in office he has hopefully eight and we'll see what the full measure\nIs accomplished as look Reagan defeated Soviet Union and probably save the planet from annihilation so that that's a that's a tough one to that's a tough one to be that's a tough record to\nCompare against but Trump so far is doing a pretty remarkable job in his own way but I play that for your just because I I think that it is helpful for all of us in fact I I Would argue that it is necessary for all of us to remind each other those of us who are conservatives\nThat as our movements and our ideology our belief system our principles\nAre rooted in a respect for the individual individual rights human dignity human life liberty that's that is the foundation of our of our belief system that we're all stars\nAnd so true anti Semitism and drew racism and I say that with a qualifier true because we know the left cause everything I Do some of the calls everything racist I mean they're they use it as a political ...\nTrue anti Semitism and racism and uh and and and bigotry is not just non conservative eighties anti set a goal to conservatism\nBecause if we are not all God's creation in doubt by our creator with an ailing double rights and if we're not all equal in the eyes of God and in the eyes of the law then there was no such thing really as conservatism edit conservatism as we know it in this country does not exist\nUh it it is not possible to be a conservative and believe that a white person or any any black person or a black person than a Hispanic person and a white person at that that they do not all have equal dignity equal rights equal worth as human beings and\nAs citizens of this great nation\nSo when the last try so hard to create this perception that people who are conservative\nI I Can't speak to the right I mean the right\n... meaning all of it I can speak the write in general terms but you know there are some fringe elements of the right that you that that day 'cause of themselves and the right you'd say well hold on a second in what meaningful way or they conservative though you know this is where you start to really get into what is right wing or left wing even mean\nYou know if you are more in favor of individual rights if you were about the individual instead of the collective right the left in this country is all about the collective and there are about collective guilt collective identity collective economics they are collective is\nThey believe in groups they believe in the common good as defined by a core of elites that all speak in the language of equality in commonality but leave as elites and separate\nFrom the masses but use the envy and antagonism of the masses in order to beat the other side politically which would be us\nWe are the individual is we are the individual rights we're all God's creation we're all human beings in this struggle together and should help each other and respect each other at each other's rights and dignity and life\nAnd that has an obligation on all of us um when when they try to make this case that racism and anti Semitism in these different ... and bigotry exist on the right I just I have a a real feeling of\nOf outrage at that because it show on true and so unfair and I think that the reason they push it so it's not just because it works it's dirty politics but it is useful for them a it is a shame that so many of the\nClasses that the Democrats view as victims whether it's just the working poor or African Americans or a or Hispanics Latinos women whatever the group maybe it's a shame that so many of them have been propagandize to such that they they really believe and I know this from talking to them they really believe that conservatives\nAre racist they believe that\nAnd you and I said you knowing that that is a\nLie it's not true we're not racist in fact we're the ones that are always advocating for people of all races to be treated equally under the law it is the left\nThat advocates for disparate treatment in the eyes of the law based upon race based upon skin color based upon not even real but perceived gender\nThey're the ones that want these differentiation\nAnd then they turn around and say that we're the ones who are obsessed with with race and gender on these other differences among among human beings\nAre when at the end of the day I I think it couldn't be any more clear that our side the side of conservatives unconstitutional is are the ones that advocate for individual rights and the dignity of all people and\nThere has always been this effort to rewrite the histories of the ... the two parties this is why Democrats you get so here I said triggered when they just brought up that they are the Democrats are the part or a party of slavery segregation Jim Crow go down the list it was it was historically\nAlways the Democrats and the Democrats have been and are the party of the mob mob mentality the mob feeling how does the mass feel how do the masses view an issue what did they demand what did they shout what where's their rage directed that has been the aid that has been at the core of the Democratic party\nThere's always been an intellectual strain and conservatism that has been first and foremost about the American founding the constitution and\nThe rights of each and every individual and the natural law that underpins all of this that it's not really just about what the founding fathers status at the founding fathers were able to harness a sense of what is a universal and eternal truths about human beings\nWhat is always true about people what is always good for society\nTo promote and what does always necessary for society to try and prevent it to condemn those universal truths are at the heart of conservatism\nAnd so it's just the the is the ... opposite of a true conservative to believe that a person is less than because it's going to college is a person is less than his agenda [noise] less than because of religious [noise] that it's not who we are [noise]\nAnd I know that you know that as I Know that that I Do think\nThat is worth sometimes taking a step back and just\nVerbalize exactly why that is different [noise]\nThere's a lot of faith and frauds out there and a lot of very easy and clever ways for people to try and falsified their records and who they are that's why if you're hiring or you're renting out your property you want the experts at global verification network to have your back so many people that have used\nGlobal verification heard about them on the show are realizing that they made the right choice because they got the customer service and the expertise that they need it and go verification network is the only do certified veteran own background investigation and\n... and the work for companies of any size folk so whether you're just to start off with all the way up to a fortune one

situation at all\nFar I hate to think of it that way I Will say that I hate to think of it that way so we'll see you\nCertainly an option President Trump saying maybe an armed guard would have been able to save lives in that horrible shooting at the synagogue in\nPittsburgh we got somebody who's got strong opinions on the matter of having somebody who is armed and trained on premises as a general matter a Jesse Kelly is with us now he is of course the host\nOf the Jesse Kelly show he is a fan favorite here in the freedom that you can hear him on our eye heart a sister station of nine fifty K. P. R. C. down in Houston every night Mr Jesse Kelly ... have you on\nDrugs to be here buck either do it rather\nUh so I you know I'm I'm always a little\nFrustrating 'cause I'm not surprise surprise not the right works I Know that after a terrible shooting incident wherever it is there there's always a suggestion of oh why do you bring up armed guards\nAt as though that some crazy idea a you know I've\nI've seen plenty of armed guards end or armed police at major religious sites where I grew up in New York City I just don't know Jesse why this gets dismissed by the ... I guess I Do know but it frustrates me that the leftist dismisses this out of hand we really do just want to save lives\nThen that's when it gets dismissed for simple reason just because it's the truth it's just like the left most dismiss off things that are the truth it is a\nSimple obvious solution that would obviously solve the problem and therefore the left is forced to hate it because they have to live in a world of make believe we have armed guards everywhere we truly care about everywhere you truly want to protect the place the target or potential target\nAs an armed guard side of it or close by that cold security that's the norm that's the real world but even bringing up an actual solution is just going to get your reactions a horror from the left who they think the only solution to disarming every ...\nI just can't imagine the circumstances where I'm In a place that generally speaking a lot of people do not you know you're you're you're not expecting that Sarah depends where you are right I I don't know what it was like in the Pittsburgh synagogue I'm guessing probably none of the you know none of the parishioners are ever armed or you know I don't know or or another congregants I should say river armed\nUm but I Know there are some churches in the south where I was people are All right I mean it it depends on where you are but the the idea that this is automatically a bad idea I think it just goes to show how ideological out of the reaction to this is because if I'm sitting there and I see somebody who's got a side arm\nAnd that's that's either a law abiding gun owners showing their side arm or he's trained security or orbit perhaps off duty law enforcement the last thought they'd ever goes through my mind is oh well I'm less safe now Jesse I mean this seems very basic\nWell it seems basic few bucks because you are CIA or do you have comments that you do you acknowledge the way the world really is\nBut I I one thing I have come to grips with is how frightening guns of anytime dar for those who have never experienced it never held them never shot one never been taught the basic safety about them it really is a terrifying thing for people who don't know they look at it\nAnd honestly it sounds crazy they see the thing is just going to start shooting\nAnd do what I think you make a really good point and you know I Know you're not just a Texan but also\nWere a marine so you've got double firearms familiarity baked in there\nBut you know you look at at the the cultural differences in the very very blue areas versus a lot of the rest of the country you know when I tell people that I went to a a camp as an eleven year old where we were firing rifles they look at me like I'm nuts I mean they think this is crazy sounding but it just goes to show\nThat part of the political and cultural divide we have now in this country is exactly what you said it's not just that people don't have ... with guns all that's a big part of it they've also been raised to think or they'd they'd been led to believe by their peers in those around them\nThat guns except in the hands of the states are always a bad thing really I mean that's really the belief and also by the way Jessie the people who are part of the state apparatus meaning there aren't police or military who want to have guns or at best suspect and at worst a threat\nYeah my kids are not they've both shot fires before real gun not just Bebe gun they've shot guns are familiar with them they have had gun safety drilled into their head\nShe thinks she's coming back I've been ... I you know I've been saying all along and you can tell her that she knows she's not supposed to let\nThat out right now she knows she's supposed to hold back a little more it's not supposed to go there and not supposed to be you know obviously pushing for her own future and the White House at this stage of the game because she comes from a damaged political brand out but you can't help herself\nHillary Clinton\nAs I have said has a hole in her soul the only thing that will fill it in her mind is the ultimate power of the presidency\nAnd there was nothing else that you could ever have or could ever do that would make what she has been through because I'm sure she views herself as a kind of victim and a and I'm a martyr for the left wing progressive causes politically speaking you know she stood beside bill she allowed\nSo many people to uh bash\nAre all these years I mean I'm saying this is in her\nIn her mind the only thing that is just the only way that justice\nIs done is if she becomes president United States and I I've been saying it and I just want to make sure that I'm very clear very on the record year what happens is that the Democrats if they take their house marchers right into fights over impeachment that becomes\nA whole discussion we're just going to be fighting over impeachment really for the next Eighteen months and then the narrative is that the only way to set right what they could not get because they will not have two thirds of the Senate so they can't remove Hillary but\nThe only way to set it right would be to make Hillary president finally to break\nThat leg and\nFinally put her in a position where she gets to be the president of the United states\nI'm I'm not the only one who's banking is Hillary yourself you could tell the world I mean I'm not saying I'm running I'm just saying that I really want the jobs bill and nobody is more qualified than I Am I mean this is this is the kind of stuff you say when you want something that you know you're not supposed to walk\nAnd or at least you're not supposed to say you want it but that's where we are with us she she has not given up\nOne bit she still thinks that this is the way that it's all going to go and and what a what a a a a crazy story and her mind has got to be for running against Brock Obama losing run against Trump and losing\nAnd in the end though in her mind justice prevails and she sets right the world and you can tell that she said oh you know there's so much work to do and her ... her mind set her attitude is alright America you know I'm the one that's got to fix fix the mess that\nThat Trump created and oh by the way you over this to me you owe me the presidency\nThat hasn't changed one bit and she is very much so in that mindset so I Know it's a little early but keep in mind that next year or this coming Tuesday went out yeah next Tuesday that's next Tuesday the midterms will be over and the presidential election will begin\nNext Tuesday is when we start to talk about who's really going to run the Democrats are I think about what you're going to have a huge field of candidates on the\nDemocratic side I think you're going to have a a massive field of all kinds of people including some real characters I'm not totally convinced that I have a nod he still thinks that Erdogan's still think that he's going to run I'm I'm not convinced\nAs crazy as that may really beat anybody who's living in the real world I Would not be surprised if you did in fact have an ... candidacy I could see I could see that happening and I think that you look at some of the others out there Elizabeth Warren\nProbably still going to run again focus conscious herself still going to run because she thinks that in the Arab Trump all that matters is that you deliver for your side and no matter how\nHumiliating her whole fake Native American or deal may have been she thinks that she can still deliver\nA socialism for America that's that is what the fights going to be make no mistake about it this is going to be about this election will be about socialism the last election was about the crony corrupt\nCollector crap Clinton's that was quite alliteration but you know what I mean the last election was about the progressive media elite establishment finally getting getting the upper ... that is so deserve that for all these years\nAnd the next election is going to be social is\nNo doubt in my mind it's going to be open forget about the kind of Bernie Sanders cuddly I just want free school stuff is going to be open a Seventy percent tax rate kind of redistribute the wealth reparations for all kinds\nThe story of wrongs a massive government intervention the healthcare market open borders so that you can dilute whatever pain the productive citizens feel by just drowning out their votes with with new arrivals um that's\nGoing to be with the next elections all about a and what's with that in mind by the way that I think of some of these some of these never\nTrump ... are just getting crazier and crazier you know they they've gone from Russia collusion and now they have to find something else to justify their their hatred\nAnd I mean Max Boot I feel weird even talking about it because he's such a weirdo and his show in significant in terms of his influence and his thinking in the in the conservative movement in fact the only ... you have to get us into wars that were or at least in one case\nIrish fair enough I produce somebody can grab one of us know something about sports says I I remember when I when I heard that before the show when I heard that somebody was like I'm not that might explain this one has ... me gave me Ken Joe I think that they've decided that their brand is that they're going to be the most shrill anti Trump lunatics on TV\nAnd that's a very crowded space right now it is you know that's not an easy thing to be number one it\nSo that drama they bring to the table I mean they ... a month I mean they look so miserable ever noticed that when they're on air how happy they look yeah well you know generally like it would go through like bucking sorry\nGenerally being double home Rutgers\nIs a bad start to things I'm just putting a a very good just putting that out I Know I Know I Try not to go to personal but you know that's not good that's not a good thing not not the\nWhat's the word bad karma yes bad karma of speaking of um I have no good\nTransition here but you know see because I was like wait NBC CBS they're\nBoth networks other than that and they're both full lives but CBS had this uh this segment about hate speech and taking down hate speech and this has been one of the issues that has you know I've been talking about for a long time here\nWhere we you know you have this chorus particularly on the left of oh you've got to get rid of certain kinds of speech on line\nUm and and you're not doing a good job of it and then we find oh wow you mean it's going to be abused and that they're just going to use this to shut down conservative stature shock\nNo one out but that's what ends up that's what ends up happening a time and again and so they they they can't get the true anti Semite off line they can't get ISIS and these other groups are to be\nTaken out of their their the cyberspace but they would they can do is is all of a sudden have second pro Second Amendment groups that find their Twitter accounts or their Facebook accounts deactivated but here's part of this\nA discussion and I have a slightly different view of this uh in terms of what the actions of these platforms should be ...\nYou can be radical online\nOnline has already been supported by\nThat we believe that after nine eleven when people had access to\nISIS supporters and those who are trying to radicalize yet I isolate it individuals we know now that Facebook Twitter and YouTube all had agreed with that and have worked with the government can take a lot of these video down why not when it comes to right or left wing extremists on line\nWell for one at very hard it's hard to identify what is extremism it's hard to identify what exactly is hate speech words are very complicated and different context and in particular case of powers\nYeah it's very easy to identify what he was doing he should have been found that should have been taken down but as a general principle it's very difficult to identify what if a speech what is not hate speech and is that from politics on that\nIt's difficult and we know that if we give them any leeway on this issue it will invariably\nBe used to the detriment of conservatives it it will be\nA situation where conservatives are the ones who find themselves the rules will certainly be much more strictly enforced against the right if they're in force against the left at all and and here's you know a very good example of exactly what I'm Talking about is the fact that Louis Farrakhan\nStill has lots of social media are still is able to view his hatred and tolerance and this is also why I just find\nSo much of the media's effort over the weekend to try and create this narrative of right wing extremism is responsible for all or almost all of the anti Semitism in this country when that's just not the case not the case at all\nAnd you know here are the kinds of things that Farrah Khan who\nYou know gets to pose and photos with rock Obama when he's running for the presidency remember that oh that's right journalist hid that from the public because they didn't want us to see what was really going on there um but Farrah Khan is still treated\nAs somebody by the media who should have and does have a voice he's not the platform he's not pushed off of all the different social media outlets but here's the kind of stuff that\nMinister Farrah Khan says play fourteen and one to\nWhere you recognize say\nAnd one where you see the same panic you\nAnd the synagogue of Satan which has many\nRaces in it [noise]\n'cause they and then the see the whole world\nThink about what they're going to say\nWhen they have been so\nAnd complete\nWhenever you read that God\nHas told the Jews to here and all they\nAnd they said I hear and I didn't know they\nOnly disobeying God\nPretty gross pretty clearly anti Semitic the say panic Jew Farrah Khan says\nAnd he's still somebody that prominent Democrats can hang out with an public can can speak with whether it's commentators were politicians uh you'll notice that you don't have Democrat\nPresidential contenders asked the way that the way the Republicans were asked about David Duke a loser that nobody cares about nobody you know gives a you know what to hear from all Republicans have to be asked in every presidential cycle will do ... do you just about David ... why is it ever Democrats you disavow do you disavow Louis Farrakhan\nWhy wasn't Brock Obama asked you you disavow Louis Farrakhan why wasn't Hillary Clinton nasty you disavow\nCirca oh that's right you mean the media is dishonest\nAnd there are activists and there are so sensitive about an hour because we now all are figuring out the truth\nYeah that's right that's what I thought\nYou know it's not smart just sort of post and stuff on the Web and you've got a job opening and hoping that someone who is great sees it you know it's not smart spending a ton of time trying to track down all the different places on line you posted it because you don't even remember 'cause you don't know what the best one was you know what is smart\nGoing as your recruiter dot com

spoke today from ATF I remember his name doesn't really matter he wants\nHis delusions the gun problem is to have all semi automatic rifles all\nSemi automatic rifles because as you said a rifle that can kill a deer can kill the human so that's what he said all semi automatic rifles needs to be licensed at the same level that a fully automatic rifle is right now that's his new solutions so you might be hearing that\nMore and more and I said oh you really think that I could get a fully I I live in DC do you think that I could even get a fully automatic weapon here no matter what I tried to

you know that that they're running on the show now some people are pushing back on that saying that it's not true that he's not being written out of the show and I I think they are responding to back last year because people were saying really that this is where it is now\nNow now you you can't have this cartoon characters but around for Twenty years and and I would note a pool is yes he's a stereotype\nOr on the show for sure there's no question right he's a stereotype but he's also not ... you know he's a family man he's a successful business owner I really mean that I mean it's not\nHe's not being put down in fact he's often used on the show to highlight the silliness stupidity and ... of other people\nWhereas you know he's actually kinda living the American dream has got a

final events\nAnd ah I read some of it was really intrigued by the ... the lead and whether or not new or any ties the vampires are we're ... or anything like that so I decided tonight it'd be great to have big Redfern on the program to talk about this and so Nick Redfern of course works full time as a writer lecture and journalists he writes about\nA wide range of unsolved mysteries big UFOs Loch Ness monster you encountered you've seen him\nOn all of the shows are from ancient aliens do a lot of other special ... and I've even appeared on some of the specials he's been on\nSo we're going

probably tied to the ...\n\nWell I mean well yeah but not in a ritual they stick by or anything like that\nOr how were they tied up with the college late tight to\nYeah ... was exactly the story with you and rabies Shay\nWell\nBasically what it was a back in two thousand is seven I was looking for a new idea for a book\nAnd I thought about doing water on the ... forest UFO landing case in England in his eye and say ha\nAnd the reason why I thought about doing it was you know I mean that in a number of books they read on the subject so ready\nBut there was some interesting threads and late suggesting that ... like almost like an M ... things sort of testing new technologies on the on the military personnel on the base rather than a rail UFO London\nAnd he said that Dr Shay um it was I'm a former Nebraska and a direct to move on and also appraised so yeah you know it's sort of a unique back right when you get to you and ate backgrounds want as a foreign direct to on the other one has

basically he told me the story of how he met two representatives of this particular group\nUm and and that for a number of decades and quietly and carefully\nInvestigating the whole issue of the UFO

ah ah the demonic personalities against these were they classify them as non human entity\nRight am I correct colder\nThan on him and entities but they fully believe they were literally team and as for the electoral al ... and um they the story was that the guys I said he went back a number of decades\nAnd so I was sort of like an agency like the ... the CIA which actually had like a head coaches they didn't even have a head courses\nUm that were like a think tank that would get together for three or four times head shop meetings\nAnd to try and figure out the latest developments and
