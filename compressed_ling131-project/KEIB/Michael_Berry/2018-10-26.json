months but the reason that this\n... around and I noticed your name or recognize that goes I'm living in a New Orleans right now grew up watching it on TV there's all the time in fact I got a lay a Christmas recommendation for us for a\nYou're getting ... recommendations for that stuff on the news so that was a relief on that I got an idea yet\nWell that's great to have you I Hope you enjoy our podcast\nAnd yeah it's been great so far you up and learn a lot for sure\nThank you so just got married\nYes yeah so we got married um and we're in the process of combining all of our finances all that kinda stuff and so I was just got to wonder and\nUm we're both on kind of the same financial standing uh she's got a little bit of a school that I've got a little bit of credit card that we both like salmon a lot of money [noise] um so as far as combining finances go as water you know there's a lot of best practices stuff like that 'cause I was trying to read on the line and there's all sorts of information all over the place\nWhere one of the factors I look at is how will both of you are\nOkay we're both in our mid thirties\nSo at that point when you get married after you've whipped independently for a long time don't rush combining everything\nOkay because you've each develop your own habits no matter how much it feels like you're on the same way when you're not going to be exactly on the same wavelength having been in a position where each of you had made all the decisions with everything involved with money\nAnd it can cause tension specially I'm In the first couple of years of marriage if you just all of a sudden combine everything\nSo a joke or it's different for people who get married in their early twenties which not as many people do any more but getting married in your mid thirties which is more common now I'm like for you to have his money her money their money\nAnd by that I mean having a joint household account\nThe both of you share and you have money that you eat to contribute to that\nEach month for rent slash mortgage other household expenses that you figure out and then you still have some money this years in an account and she has money that's hers and accounts that cup and then on credit cards\nI don't want you to combine those for a a few years\nAll right so credit cards for a few years yeah that was actually going to be my next question because as far as you know combining it to a joint that child that's a checking account that or you don't like debit cards\nUh so I was reading you know there's a thing like with credit cards especially for a joint groceries things like that I can make her life and a cup holder or under my credit card or I'm a joint credit card something like that is there anything as far as that goes with the credit cards\nSo for spending that you're going to do that fits under the house account category like groceries you're gonna both eat 'em your cell phone bills if you combine a cell phone plan any of the stuff you're doing is a combined activity\nIt's great for you to have like a house account credit card that you pay in full each month that has some kind of rewards attached to it\nThat is your first joint credit account but for things like when she's going to buy closer you are or she's going to get her hair done or whatever\nBecause you're each approaching it from years of making individual decisions those things are best at least for now left as individual charges on eat on individual cards rather than on one that's Troy\nOkay and so we can do like a joint credit card to realize that was the thing\nYeah you can be co owners of a cart\nOr she can add you for a house account she can add you as an authorized user you can add her isn't authorize user to wonder if yours for the things that fit under house expenditures the concept is that you know over time you'll find how best you're spending merges is your wife\nOr goes on together ... doing it all at once can cause tension that you didn't even know could be there\nAnd that's why the merging of finances should be gradual instead of a media and congratulations to both of you you're listening to the Clark Howard
