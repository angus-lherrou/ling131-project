cheating on him with a high school\nOr oh\nThat's a story right there that's a story well all that\nTo say let's get to what I Choose to be the top story of\nToday and that is going back to that crazy Russia collusion did you notice clear your mind from home and see if you can recall the last time you saw story about Russian collusion\nProbably been a while\nThat was the top news story for quite some time Trump was supposed to be imprisoned by now I mean that story had a solid thrown he needed to resign it was bad I could play you twenty minutes of montage 'cause of\nABC NBC CBS CNN MSNBC you name it\nTalking about Russian collusion and surely must be true or they wouldn't be talking about it this much\nWell let's take a trip down memory lane some of you will remember the name of Glenn Simpson Glenn Simpson is a\nFormer journalist with one of the major papers who founded a an opposition research firm called fusion GPS\nAnd fusion GPS it would appear is hired to go out and destroy your political opponents that's what they do it\nPays better than the New York times or the Washington Post and you don't have to show up to work every day and probably want to work nearly as hard and you got billionaires writing checks to keep their guy winning and the other guy losing because you're going to dig up dirt and then once you dig up dirt whether it's true or not\nYour job is to give that to the media because\nIf the media reports on a story\nOnce they report on that story even if the story is not true even if they know the story is not true once they report on the story and it makes it into the public domain than it necessarily becomes an item that everyone can cover\nSo the trick is if you want to get a lie out into the public domain you simply put the story out there and then you ... or you put together the story you give that to a member in the media who is your friend\nThat person who is your friend reports that there are reports of this because you can't say it's true or you'll get sued and you could lose that's what happened to Rolling Stone and the University of Virginia\nBut once you get the story once you can get one friend of yours to write the story and remember it's all about the cliques in in the world of it being all about the clicks the trick is the trick with clicks is to be the first one to put the story out there\nBecause then\nDrudge and

knew that if somebody who wasn't in the room halfway down the hallway had screamed it out remember that\nWell that is when you consider the anatomy of a smear\nThat's how it works all you do is you get somebody to report that it may possibly and some alternate universe be true and then everyone else piles on to that and says\nNew York times is reporting or Washington Post is reporting her some news station in Little Rock is reporting or some news station in Baton Rouge just reporting here's Nancy Pelosi explaining how this works\nDemonized and ... ... called the wrap up near my politics has

it's called the wrath of swarmed the merchandise to passes report unfair that we may all Catholic\nSo that's what Feinstein did remember\nThat's what Feinstein did this happens a lot and you don't realize you're being played most of the time but what Feinstein did is she got the media to report on Christine forward and then she said oh my goodness well yes yes it's it's true\nWe don't know if it was Feinstein who got the media to report it or\nIf it was crazy Mazie Hirono there were several people involved during all of that time and ... when the post mortem is written on how the Democrats blue Kavanaugh\nIt's not just going to be that Kevin all went on the Supreme Court because Kavanaugh was always supposed to be on the Supreme Court they never believed or they didn't believe before it that they had a chance to keep him off they had to show their base that they were doing something to keep him off\nThey built a little momentum they swung for the fences they pulled out all the stops me think of any other cliches I could use\nFor um for the fences pulled out all the stops they left no stone unturned\nThey tried at all but in losing after having one for the fences they didn't just lose the cabinet nomination they were going to do that before I submit we'll get into some of the the polling data hearing the minute I submit that they lost the midterms\nThey lost their chance to

or discussed with Bruce or the Steele dossier prior to the October application that's the ... application in two thousand sixteen or the two thousand sixteen presidential election\n[noise] that is in

at such a level that they threaten our republic and I don't say that lightly\nThey committed crimes that must be punished to the full extent of the law\nAnd I hope they are let's get to the president on sixty minutes over the weekend I think he had a very good weekend and I think he's become very very good at this\nI'm going to play for you some clips of his interview with Leslie stall and I want you to see how on message he remains\nSome people when they get into a meeting like this Lesley Stahl is a very talented journalist she's very good\nShe will mix one part familiarity with another part respect and almost sort of a false I'm\nA false praise and then come back with a short of overbearing school ... attitude that demands you tell the truth it would be a mistake to underestimate how good she is that what she does\nNevertheless Donald Trump went into that meeting absolutely kept his cool that she tried she really wanted him to lose is cool\nAnd he didn't and he stayed focused and where it matters I don't think that that Donald Trump won you know Dianne Feinstein over to his side I don't think he won the grand ... of the Democratic party over to his side\nBut I Do think among his base in middle America\nI think he comes off very strong during this interview let's go through some clips of it she begins by asking him these sort of deep questions that that Morocco bomb it used to love\nYou know what what do you dream about what is your fear she's trying to make a headline out of this interview and Trump looks are dead in the eye and basically says you people are liars is the cheats you knaves I don't trust you\nAnd I don't think most Americans do here's what he said\nFirst president to the United states who never had a political posts before we're never served in the military you come up here you've been here for almost two years what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president\nOkay so I always used to say the toughest people or Manhattan real estate guys and Bob [noise] now I say their babies who have that has the political people this is the most deceptive vicious world\nIt is a vicious it's full of lies deceit and deception and you make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with a that table give me an example I don't want to give you an example I'm not looking at in the meantime nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do in Lebanon\nThat they put around his comments which would suggest that they were which would know not sure which would state that they were taking his words directly and that would be important they wrote President Trump says quote Robert elite was a great\nGeneral end quote during Ohio rally calling the Confederate leader quote incredible in quote\nWell even liberals in the media came out in criticized what they had done even liberals in the media came out in distance themselves from what NBC had done here is the president's comments now\nI happen to think as many military historians do that Robert really was a very effective general\nAnd I think one of the factors in his favor on that subject is the fact that President Lincoln sought to employ him in a senior position within the union army\nFact he was invited to the ... to the White House so that the case could be made that he not break off and lead his fellow Virginians which he did the ...\nBut then he lead the union\nHe had a lineage at West point which was nothing short of spectacular um and in a union wanted his services and be the one to keep them away from the Confederate\nHe's been regarded throughout history by military who's historians as a very bright effective successful tactician\nNow there's been in the last Twenty years in an attempt to discredit his military actor maintenance and that's fine it's based in the fact\nThat it's based in this sort of revisionist some of the confederacy was awful therefore anything that went on there if they develop a cure for cancer in a Confederate a I'm\nA medical temp they would have declared that it wasn't such a great I'm a discovery after all ... it's that bad\nBut the point I'm making here is the military is attempt to smear the president by taking words did I say military the media's attempt to smear the president by taking words out of context\nIs backfiring over and over and over again because increasingly\nAmericans don't believe them and increasingly they give Americans every reason not to believe that here is the president's actual statement and I would I Would beg to find anyone who could disagree\nWith anything he says here you're free to have your own opinions but there's certainly nothing he says here\nThat that speaks to white supremacy or anything of of of the store and NBC had the ... had to come back and do something they rarely do and correct their article and admit that what they said he said he didn't say here's what he did say\nOhio State that gave us a great president who has it been properly recognized OK William McKinley has not been properly record that what he did in terms of fray\nIn terms of war but in terms of trade and I hate to say it in terms of being smart and tariffs William McKinley has not been properly recognize but maybe someday he will [noise]\nIt also gave you [noise] a general who is incredible he drank a little bit too much [noise]\nYou know what I'm Talking about [noise]\nSo Robert Daly it was a great general [noise]\nAds Abraham Lincoln develop a phobia he couldn't be Robert Ley he was going crazy I don't know if you do this but Robert Daly was winning battles after\nBattles after battles and Abraham Lincoln gamma rays that I can speak robber namely any at all of these generals they look great they were the top of that class at West point they were the greatest people\nThere's only one problem\nThey didn't know how to held when they didn't know how to fight [noise] they didn't know how and one day it was looking really bad and Lincoln just said you hardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem\nAnd Lincoln said I don't care what probably as you guys aren't winning [noise] and his name\nGrant general [noise]\nYou sort of bravery Lyndon Johnson another Democrat called Robert de leite quote a great some of the south a great leader of the south as a man he's stood as the symbol of valor end of duty\nSorry that's actually from Gerald Ford Gerald Ford said as a man who stood as the symbol of valor and the duty\nThat was in a bill that he signed restoring Robert he leaves US citizenship\nJimmy Carter a Democrat said Roberts Lee was a man who understood the values of a region which he represented\nHe called him a great leader Reagan called Robert de ... an American legend George W. Bush addressing the United states military academy called Robert ... the perfect West Point graduate\nSo the media criticizes Donald Trump for saying that US Grant the feeding Robert he was a major event because leave with such a good general and the media says oh I shouldn't\nDo that when nothing less than West Point considers him to have been one of the finest and his father before him by the way\nThis isn't a confederacy issue this isn't a in an attempt to battle for the honor and dignity\nOf those who opposed\nWhat Lincoln's union represented this is simply another example of trying to twist the words and actions of people in an attempt to swing an election\nTo sway the opinions of people with dishonesty the same network that used doctored photos of George Zimmerman's head when\nTrayvon Martin had bang him on the floor on the on the\nAsphalt in an attempt to kill him and finally tsimerman in fear for his life was had busted opening gushing blood had to pull the trigger\nNBC doctored those photos so that they didn't look like his head was split wide open because they wanted it to be the case that Zimmerman wanted to kill Trayvon did he killed him without provocation so they actually doctored the photos\nWhen you reached the point that you can no longer report the news but that you actually all through the news\nIn order to win your point how can anyone trusts you after ... how can anyone ever trust you and so then the media is left\nConsidered on trustworthy their stories being called fake news nobody believing anything they say an angry at you the idiot who believes Trump and not them\nAnd yet they keep engaging in this nonsense and yet they keep thinking they can get away with this nonsense\nThey choose not to report on ... and their violence they choose to portray you are people in the Republican Party as violent mobs they won't let it be called a mob when Ted Cruz and his wife are run out of a restaurant where they're doing nothing more than trying to have dinner\nAnd I think it's going to cause them to lose [noise] think it's going to cause them to lose [noise]\nAnd I want to get to President Trump's interview on sixty
