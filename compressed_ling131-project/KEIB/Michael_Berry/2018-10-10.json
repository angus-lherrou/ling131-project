the overall physique kind of term legitimate business reason or purpose\nAnd using the example with Robin Hood they're required\nWhen they open an account for somebody to know who you are\nAnd so they

probably six months ago she said you know\nMaybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period but at the end of the year [noise] I Want to take a little time off or what but she's been a very successful you know governor of South Carolina [noise] for eight years and then she uh\nShe did this and this is possibly the more in tune with what's going on in the world I'm very dangerous thing a lot of things which is a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together we've solved a lot of problems or one of the process of selling a lot of problems at the beginning or North Korea was a

speculation that she was stepping down to run for president in twenty twenty presumably against President Trump she addressed that\nAnd said that she would not be running for president in twenty twenty and that the only campaigning she would be doing in twenty twenty would be for President Trump\nAnd so hopefully that can put that to rest the biggest sparks came when a reporter asked President Trump about the swearing in of\nBrett Kavanaugh to be an associate justice to the Supreme Court at the White House and of course that Hillary still wishes she was president and so his response I thought was priceless\nWhat's your response was saying last night where it\nI guess that's why she lost [noise] she doesn't get it [noise] she never did I knew that a long time\nAgo [laughter]\nAnd that was probably the most reported statement of the press conference and so with less than a month ago before the midterms President Trump owned the media cycle Hillary Clinton\nIn an interview made some statements that are not being received very well\nWe're cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you found for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the Senate that's when civility started down but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize anger that its strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nWill get back to Hillary Clinton's comments in the next segment because they could not be better time to\nI think that that just that is just one more element that will fire up the base as we go into the election season today is the last day in the state of Texas to have registered on is to have registered to vote in the mid term elections\nTexas does not have a an online registration that's available now it's also the last\nDay to register in Georgia Kentucky and Tennessee for those of you in Louisiana\nYour last day to register in person was today but you can register online for one more week until the ... in New York you can register up to twenty five days before the election which is October twelve\nUm but it must be ... you can also register by mail but it must be received by October seventeenth\nIn Alabama the rule is Fifteen days before the vote and so you can register up till October twenty second that is also the case in California\nAnd through our Oregon affiliated or by the way Oregon and Louisiana or a through October sixteenth so one more week\nAnd for our listeners to K. E. X. eleven Ninety out of Portland, Oregon who live in Washington state your last day to register was yesterday your rule is twenty two days\nBefore the election but you can vote in person until October twenty nine I'm not actually sure how that works\nUm I was going through and looking at the various dates of registration and I saw that\nSo for our state of Washington residence\nUm because that is unclear to me if you are not yet registered or your registration may have lapsed\nChecked that on line there will be resources to each of you depending on your state's I'm asked to win exactly you can vote spent some time on that don't just ask somebody I often get asked questions in passing on the last day to register\nAnd there are often um some technicalities that go into that we will begin early voting before what I typically referred to as election day and I encourage you to early vote it's always easier there are typically more places for you to vote early\nThere is a shorter line than on election day and then if you get posted out of town or out of out of the country or you're sick or a relative or is is sick or it's raining terribly or for whatever reason then you don't miss the opportunity to vote so I'll give you early voting days as we get a little\nBit closer of because I Would really like to see Republicans hold the house the Senate when some governor's races and

you asked\nAbout um\nAlso what what do you think it said\nHoly remote part of downers he just talking from a distance or you in the bottom of a well\nOh no oh yeah there you go All right so go ahead\nOh yeah oh I said the Democrats take over the house a ... a whole trial will acquire hall and going to reverse the economy going to kind of stay on the water [noise]\nWell [noise] that's a complicated question I think that the single most important aspect of the Trump presidency will say return in investor confidence and I returned to consumer confidence\nThe problem is with the quantitative easing that during the Obama years and this actually\nGoes back to the months just before the Obama president ... the Obama inauguration\nThe fed pumps so much money into the economy and there was a period of time there that banks were basically getting free money\nIn order to to bolster the banks you were giving the banks free money to then go out and Lynn\nWhat can you imagine it [laughter]\nIf if I told you to over to a burger joint and I came in and brought you all the supplies and and everything and covered your labor and all you had to do is sell the burgers I think most everybody could succeed in that market\nAnd so that's what happened the problem is once you open that spigot nobody wants to close it off so you had artificially depressed\nInterest rates that Trump was Trump was ... I mean the Obama was getting the benefit of\nSo even though the Tropicana me is better than the Obama economy was\nIt's an artificial comparison because what's happening now as you're watching these are the the these um um interest rates start to creep back up\nAnd first of all you don't want that to happen before the election and that starts to scare people the cost of borrowing money which means the cost of research and development the costs of opening new locations the cost of investing in capital those sorts of things\nIncrease which slows that economic activity now for some reason\nAmericans have not been as willing to reward Trump for the economy that he ushered in as they should be\nI think that's probably partly due to this very divisive media strategy I think it's it's partly due to a very aggressive ah anti Trump movement and so he's not getting the bump that I think you you probably should have\nExpected him to get I mean look we're\nSeeing historic numbers unemployment claims down first time unemployment claims down which means layoffs or reduce the number of people are seeking work they can't find it or or down\nExpansion in in the job force the stock market hitting historic has I think the stock market has now hit a hundred highs record highs\nDuring his presidency\nNow think about that that's like hitting a a a four hundred foot homerun or five hundred foot home run it's not just that you hit a home run the next day in order to out do that you got to hit five oh five and then five ten and then five Fifteen and this economy has done that\nSo people have had this overnight increase in in wealth\nAnd that is due to a stock market that up that I think reflects a lot of aspects that Trump is responsible for a president can ever claim all the success or failure of the stock market during the presidency there's no doubt\nAnd he was trying to encourage young black students at this mostly not solely or exclusively but mostly black university

them to vote for him\nWhereas Ted Cruz is half Hispanic\nAnd basically the same age but he does mean what he says does any don't let these old white people\nDecide our lives for us [noise] how long do
