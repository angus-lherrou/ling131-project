girl and what's her name [noise] Nora Nora that's beautiful name thank you well how can I be of service\nThree thousand Eighteen has been pretty skewed in busy year um our recently changed jobs and made some good improvements there are just bought a house or obviously the baby but my question is\nThe job I have they offer a decent ... but I can kind of micro manage myself through one of the major providers for four one K. and I was kind of wondering\nWhat kind of direction ark and go in there without kind of put in the big hindrance on the things I mean I'm thirty six I'm not really like had a four one K. until now so I Want to do what I can\nTell you a barn got a lot of new responsibilities on you all at once\nRight yes I mean with the new job things are going well I'm not really in a bind at all I'm making more money because there was a new job I mean I'm not saying you know which by any means but so I was just on the one the what I Do\nWell if you're just if you if this is your starting point of saving for retirement you want to do as as much as you possibly can stomach financially so in the four one K. did they offer a match where you've gone to work\nThey start off at six percent and then they build from there and I think you I Can't remember right now what the cop out is but I Know they start off at six ... whatever you got it\nRight so you want to put in as much money as you can to pick up all the free money they're going to give you write and do you know are you offered the option of doing what's known as a raw four O. one K. or as anybody mentioned that do you are you're only allowed to do traditional four one K.\nThey give me all kinds of options a traditional archery they're off our area and there's some I think\nActually ... are you going to show a rough four oh one K. where we are\nYeah yeah yeah so am I thirty six I Would go a raw four one K.\nMoney the employers matching will be a put down the traditional side that money you contribute goes on the wrong side and if they keep raising what they'll match based on how much you put in\nI Want you to go as far as you can putting money into that raw four one K. you pick up every single dollar\nThe employer will throw at you and if overtime they'll throw more money at you you increase what you contribute and end the plan there will be if I'm gathering investing is new for you is that right\nYeah I had just basically started with a horn K program before I transferred into my new job so I've only ... you know only dabbled with a just a little bit or I you know the with my employer now they seem like they're off with a pretty good deal so I wanted\nTo go see him around and around every bit of it that they're giving you free money and then as far as an investment choice at least at first keep it as simple as possible and one of the choices you'll likely have is what's known as a target retirement fund\nAnd based on your age of thirty six you would want to look at uh twenty fifty five and that would be the year there would be your target for retired ...\nOkay and so you just put all the money you're going to contribute ended at twenty fifty and they'll handle how it's invested for you in a variety of things that would be appropriate for you being at this stage of saving for retirement\nSo congratulations to you again on Nora and best you in this new job and

from folks who for one reason the other were not able to vote on election day you can imagine the various reasons they get hospitalized they get called out of town on worked unavoidable\nTheir kid gets terribly ill they don't want to leave them there in an auto accident you name it it happens and then you don't get to vote in your vote counts it matters especially your vote\nBecause you're the smart voters we don't have enough of you so we need every one of you to vote vote early vote straight Republican ticket it matters [noise] I've been asking folks to\nUh\nTell me about your voting experiences\nTWA writes I went to the Jersey village decision the greater Houston area\nWent to the Jersey village polling location and about eleven this morning nothing unusual everything went very smoothly I did not vote straight Republican ticket this time I could not cast my vote for the Alamo destroyer George Bush instead I voted for the libertarian candidate may I suggest you advise to voters to do the same\nWe should not disturbed that hallowed ground\nYeah my problem with telling people to vote anything other than straight party ticket is that it gets lost in the translation so while I think George Bush has done an awful job\nWould rather when the seats that matter the most important seats that matter and deal with him in the future so I'm asking people to vote straight Republican Ramona and I went and cast their votes today and we're very happy to do so um when you say remember\nWas there anything about our voting experience that you would like\nTo share this for the women in front of us were very attractive I don't know how this happened but we had um\nOne woman in very tight yoga pants I mean restricting a circulation sort of tight yoga pants and tennis shoes I'm a very muscular I'm told should I say I'm probably thirty eight year old black woman\nUm she she wasn't talking to anybody though unfortunately we kept trying to make her eyes and make small talk um the other was the what do you think that role was Hispanic\nWoman that was too in front of us\nYeah um she was very attractive and and for some reason I said something inappropriate that Ramon chest asked me for I noted to him that she had beautiful hands in addition to many of our other features and he thought\nWe voted straight ticket Republican from St Lucia\nAnd there you have it that's Glenda Lee say you're on the Michael berry she'll go ahead there\nHello yeah\nHi I wanted to call in and say that I really believe that the package is a clinical di ... thing you can get flak\nFrom a job not not campaigning flak from the whole caravan thing that's not working for them\nOkay are you are not the first person to say that Dave go ahead\nSo I don't know if you have an open Saturday and Sunday you know it's funny you should be able to find out\nOn Saturday you should go out and\nThat is correct thank you Dave I'm for those of you in Texas anyway I don't want to speak to other states and get it wrong if you need to vote on the weekend um you because for whatever reason you can't get to the polls during the week\nIs seven eight to Seventy in Harris County anyway I Know that to be true and then Sunday has one to six you can look it up in the county in which you live the voter registrar the elections officer of record in your county or perish we'll I'm Will\nWe'll post your voting location remote and I went ... how long do you think it it didn't take long enough because we were staring at these two women in front of us we would have been happy if we could have stayed in line longer to be completely honest [noise]\nUm how long but Fifteen minutes I think it was less than it was ten maybe ten [noise] um\nIt was really easy um I always get a lot of emails from folks on these voting machines and you know if you're convinced the voting machines are crooked corrupt wired ... that's your business or you know I'm Sorry that I don't devote enough time for you on that it is true that it's tricky little machine\nAnd it is true that you need to go slowly I admit I get a bit of anxiety when it comes to the machine because I Want to make sure that my vote is cash correctly and I suspect others do too because my vote matters I take my ... very seriously it might just be one vote\nBut I take very seriously um my choice\nAs to who is going to fill the seat and serve in a row and I want to make sure that my voice is heard properly so I Do I I go through very slowly\nAnd I cast my vote and then I go back where it gives you a chance to review it and I go tedious Lee line by line by line Ramon you don't because you were waiting outside and you kind of rush through it\nYou're that kid that turns his paper into early and went through the whole thing and then cast my vote and there's a good feeling I stuck my I voted sticker on my forehead today because I wanted everybody to know\nAnd I think it's important\nUh you don't want to get hokey but I I Do I find it to be a very important Mike Europe\nYeah hey Michael how are you doing good hey let me tell you what I I've been thinking about this\nMost of the day before I went to vote and I'm telling you I think the whole situation is just a little bit to clean it's almost like a part of a psychological operations plan where it's\nOne of those if this then that thing so if a caravan didn't work now they try this and you notice that everyone is very prominent and they all ended\nUp they're supposed to target at the same time but what concerns me about all this is this is not effective\nI I I fear that might be a Democrat offered it where they you know knock the prominent people that know about this but I think this is not effective Nancy Pelosi said it a week ago you know some there's going to be some collateral damage I fear somebody's going to get hurt at some point and this is the same party they\nTry to blame then got on a video tape for a while [noise] interesting\nSo do you think it is a democratic operative who's doing this but not for NATO and at the highest levels\nI think that's exactly right I think there's some plausible deniability that kind of built in\nAnd I think that it's probably somebody who's young and likes to think they're big on strategy but those of us who've lived a long time and I've seen how some of these things work\nIs it fear I fear that if there's always the next step in the plant that if this doesn't work then something else is already lined up and it just\nTo clean to have these specific individuals and twelve days before election day getting these packages all at the same time and I I think that if in fact\nThis was not out there will have an arrest by Monday because of the police and the law enforcement people looking at that are really I think they're that good and coming from the military background as myself I really think they're that good but if this is in fact an operative where political\nA game of some sort where no one was ever intended to get hurt I don't think anyone is going to get Russia I don't think they'll find out\nDo you think that they\nTo say and say that last line\nWell I think that if I think the first responders and the Alcohol Tobacco and firearms people in the ... I think they're really good such that if this was in fact intended to hurt somebody and we're really a real threat I think they'll have an arrest by next week\nDo you think okay so so they're they're let me ... that you think this was orchestrated by a Democrat operative do you think that anybody was intended to be harmed\nNo sir I don't go not just not this time but what I see what I fear is that if this plan\nOr if this story does not play the way that they wanted it to a I think that I'm fearful that they might her one of their own and call it collateral damage him and blame it on Trump I mean I don't think your language actually John anymore to harm anything than what\nSome of the other people have said you know you stack it up and people are so\nRight yeah no no and I got I don't mean to suggest your opinions on board and I am really want to get your thoughts on who did this and what you what you believe they did and what what they intended to do so you think they meant to frighten America\nAnd and maybe get an immediate boost in the polls of sympathy vote a but not have to actually harm anyone because they would be supporters of these people that that's what I think
