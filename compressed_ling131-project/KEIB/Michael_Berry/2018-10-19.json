it public\nAnd I'm not convinced she'd necessarily wanted to make it public I think she had a pretty good sense it might be a loser of an issue she was boxed into a corner damned if she did and damned if she didn't because\nIf she doesn't bring the Ford allegation forward when it showed up on her doorstep she was the one who found out about then she catches heat because you sat on this you could
