H. P. A. L. E. A. S. C. and swap Elise dot com\nAnd the other one is lease trader dot com way both of these sites make their money is you\nSet up an account with them you with your vehicle that you're trying to get out of your lease you pay them if the if they're able to find somebody to take over your face and somebody hopefully takes it over now why would somebody want to take over a year lease\nBecause it may feel at time gap for them\nAnd I know my brother who is the one who who's retired who just travels the world he and his wife have looked at this as a way to have shorter term transportation cheaper than renting a car one month at a time and so there are people who need\nShorter term operation of a vehicle and that's something they can benefit from so again there's swap Elise and least trader dot com usually it's hard to make those work though is early in the lease is your son is\nIn almost every state um and so I Will I Will do my best to get early voting information for folks but I Would encourage you to go on line they typically make it pretty easy to do despite what the Democrats say voting is pretty easy in this guy's pretty easy to\nTo qualify and to execute your vote\nAnd I would encourage you to vote early and I don't think I have to tell you the Democrats\nNeed to be punished they need to be punished for the type of mob violence to more people are Republicans a two Republican elected official candidates I'm accosted\nIn separated the incidence in Minnesota one getting a a a concussion or the mob violence has to stop\nAnd the only way the Democrats are ever going to understand that they have to stop this if they have to lose they have to be defeated at the polls to understand the American people will not live under these conditions\nIt's sort of like Chicago you might say to yourself well\nIt's mostly black on black crime a and I'm not black so my likelihood of getting shot as low not true\nThese guys are indiscriminate when they're driving through the streets blast in a way you never know if you might be pull it up to a gas station a breach of the peace is\nA danger to us all and you don't want that going on in our society we don't want this type of violence\nYou might not have been the congressman who was crawling around bleeding out on the softball field ... when a Bernie Bro went to assassinate him and other Republicans\nBut we all feel that right\nIn just the way that we all feel the Las Vegas shooting or school shootings\nAnd it has to stop it has to stop\nSo I'm going to encourage people to vote Republican to vote straight party Republican now many of you Republicans tend to over think this many of you will come to the conclusion while I'm only gonna vote top of the ticket might governor's race my Senate race I don't know any of these other people and it's true you may not\nBut how about this\nOne of the two individuals in every race will have made a decision that they want to be a member of the party of Nancy Pelosi and Sheila Jackson Lee\nAnd Dianne Feinstein\nThey made a decision to be a part of Chuck Schumer's party in Morocco bombers party and Hillary Clinton's party\nAnd they'll tell you oh I I'm not part of some person I can work with everybody\nAnd maybe they'll go to dinner with anybody any lobbyists that comes from any background can buy them dinner take them on a private jet\nBut when it comes to cast their votes when it comes to supporting a cost that is their party's cause\nThat will hold their nose into it that's what they'll do and don't forget\nThey are the farm team for the next generation a bronco bombers and Hillary Clinton's now I Want to get to um some updates\nWith regard to the FBI and investigations that were looming Robert Mueller it has emerged now will not come forward prior to the mid term\nYou can read most anything into most anything but I think it is fair to say that if Mueller had anything on Trump that he thought might be useful in hurting Trump he would have released that information\nJust before the voting started and I suppose you still could\nBut why would he wait until after the midterms to present his key findings as they are calling them on the Russia probe\nLet's presume for a moment he has nothing\nAnd at this point he has presented nothing Manafort had his trouble we haven't Manafort up that Manafort had a stroke but his trouble related to not paying taxes Michael Cohen had his trouble his trouble had to do with the fact that he was basically running a criminal enterprise in addition to being a lawyer\nSo why wouldn't you present this information to Carter Page never really doing anything wrong Papadopoulos never do anything wrong all the money that was spent\nAll the man hours all the promises\nOf the crimes committed in that you would get to the bottom of\nThe hill report special counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly expected to present findings related to key aspects of his investigation into Russian interference in the two thousand sixteen presidential election after\nThis November's midterm elections Bloomberg News signing a pair of ... U.S officials reported on Wednesday that Mueller is close to finalizing his inquiry into a pair of the most important aspects\nOf the investigation now the cynical sodomy says the fact that they've come out this early with plenty of time to cure the potential delay in presenting the evidence\nMeans that it creates the time for the appearance of a groundswell of demand that Mueller let us know what's going on before the midterms and that would put Mueller end of the situation like candidates who create their own\nA a\nActivity there most of their own interest by saying they've been asked to run their never asked to run they want to run there's no one asking\nHim a run they just say that\nIt could be that Mueller is creating all of this doing all this engaging and all this\nSo it could look like well people were asking me to present this before the November ... turns ... midterms than [noise]\nOkay I guess I Will [noise]\nYou're on the ball [noise]\nContinue on the Michael berry ... [noise]\nLike ... have Ramsey show these days is three fond of patriot am eleven fifty big day for the\nTrump Administration we've been told oh my gosh the frame wars coming it's going to be so terrible and the dogs and cats living together mass hysteria it's going to result in massive economic losses either going to say oh my God I hearken back to the days of your what Obama was the president and the economy was booming\nThing along but at least we didn't have framed wars [noise] no not the way this is going to go [noise] we already have our first love and\n\n\n\nWe have injected too much\nOf the criminal justice apparatus into our political system\n... the court system has\nIntruded too far into the political system the process was designed for change for the public's approval and disapproval to be registered in the form of votes\nAnd so rather than Mueller doing this big investigation\nWhat we really have to recognize is it the American people elected Donald Trump and the leadership of the FBI\nDidn't want Donald Trump the one Hillary Clinton and so\nAt the FBI we know what they were doing the information we remember what the IRS was doing to keep people from campaigning against\nMorocco bomb these people are criminals threatening our problems from\nThinning all great cities in between\nMorning he'll brief President Trump about the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal could show again\nThey just alleged leak from the investigation ... newspaper identifying a man who went to the county that shortly before the generals dissipated as someone who previously traveled with Saudi Arabia's crown prince to the United states meanwhile the Washington Post publishing what it calls\nTalk jeeze last call it describing abuses against journalists by Middle East in government\nFox is Simon ... investigators in Wisconsin and said they believe a missing Thirteen year old girl was there when her parents were shot and killed at home in the middle of the night Monday and the chief somewhere in danger\nIs it a random attack or is it a targeted attack I I don't know that answer\nBaron county sheriff Chris Fitzgerald says there's no reason to believe that Jamie classes are run away or a suspect in her parents murders [noise] this is Fox News [noise]\nOf course that's the thing is you know and I'm actually an end and Australia and I want to talk to you for real about something\nVery important if you are ready to change that well we want to send you a few hundred college student one shot in line to Australia to learn how to be a mental change my vote as a mentor into\n[noise]\n\nNews it will relate to last through item of meteor a logical\n\nThings will play much shining star show some\nMaybe some money on a\nYou know shot by like ...\nWant you to answer bizarre it was you could you\nSo here we are two years yeah [noise]\nAnd I will confess\nI have worried that Mueller who is very crafty ferries sly very clever\nVery mean nasty man that he would give the impression he was going to indict Trump and then he would do it right before the midterms I had been afraid of that I did not give voice to that but I've been afraid of that\nAnd I'm Still not sure that will happen\nI don't know that he could get an indictment there's an old line and legal circles at a good prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich sort of like the old line at the earlier level in the criminal justice process you can beat the rat but you can't beat the ride\nYou know anybody can sue you\nYou can throw it out of court but that means you didn't get sued\nIf you're getting married tomorrow and the story emerges that you've been arrested or you've been sued or you've been accused your future inlaws Meg oil is put off this election for I mean this uh marriage for a couple of weeks we might be dealing with the bad guy what turns out you didn't do anything wrong\nBut at that moment the accusation will always have hanging in the air well maybe it's true and I've been worried that Mueller would do this\nBut now there is considerable speculation and this is where the game of chicken begins this is where it gets complicated in this is where Trump is good Trump met with roses team recently when air force one\nThe expectation was Trump was going to fire Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice roses sees one who appointed a special prosecutor it all goes back to Jeff Sessions\nSessions after he becomes attorney general he then says oh allegations of Russian collusion well I was a part of the campaign I had meetings I'm going to step down when he stepped down the guy\nHe would've never appointed a special prosecutor special counsel but when he stepped down Rod Rosenstein steps in and says\nWe're going to bring in Robert Mueller\nA close friend of Jim Comey insists the president has fired combing we're gonna bring in the special prosecutor the special counsel and we're basically going to torment Trump and there's no reason to believe they're going to stop anytime soon\nThis is where it gets to be like a game of\nBattle did you play by ... that's a good game as quality game is a quality gay you call it out and they made an electric where do you have electronic version they had the electronic version [noise] if you put your your piece in a certain spot and there's was on it would make a like a blow up south yeah we had to do it like gotcha\nCue for to be one battle she you remember so you just moved to\nOkay All right well now we've got a game of cat and mouse high stakes cat and mouse\nBecause Mueller if he presents his evidence before the ... terms he gets to own the news cycle for a day or two there's no doubt about that so if he wanted the damage Trump\nIn the most egregious way and I believe he does\nIf he wanted to damage Trump then he drops his news a day before the election\nBut if you serve your country in the military those guys don't think in terms of one day I Want to be invited to the halls of political power in this country with the\nThe the gold drapes behind me and the lectern the flag the room crowded and Fox News carrying live and the president put the metal around my neck they don't think in those terms\nAnd I think maybe that's what makes it special is that they did not compromise or cash in our sellout or pursue\nTheir simply being recognized for incredible incredible valor and when that blue ribbon goes around their neck and the president ties it in the back\nThey have the\n... the look on their face seemingly like this is taking forever\nBecause these aren't the highest ranking guys in the military\nThey're not used to the spotlight these are the guys that actually fight the wars these are the guys at the the lowest levels that are seeing bullets whiz by they're just not accustomed to this\nAnyway\nI didn't want this day to go with that I didn't want the show about without noting that [noise] so bombing and as um\nWas on trial his buddy\nWho was convicted gave him a lot of money and flew them around in his private jet they went down to the Dominican Republic where\nHe supposedly cured for Bob Menendez teenage girls\nMenendez used as his defense oh he was a bribing me were just really good friends friends do these things for friends\nWell but he was under investigation and he did get political favors done on his behalf\nWell Menendez managed to save his scout but it's unclear whether he'll be able to save his political career\nThe biggest a Senate Democrat pack about to drop three million dollars in New Jersey just say Menendez the Huffington Post writes Senate majority pac which is controlled by allies of\nSenate minority leader Chuck Schumer Democrat from New York will use the cash to air a statewide ad attacking Menendez his opponent former pharmaceutical executive Bob ... as an ally of president Donald Trump\nIn a state where the president\nIs deeply unpopular [laughter] so it was at a fundraiser for an end as it Hillary crashed her van on Monday Night for Hillary she can't do anything right\nHugging the Republicans have been hitting Menendez hard over the\nUnder aged prostitutes down in the Dominican Republic but I'm not sure it's going to matter\nI'm increasingly of the pinion that Democrats don't care as long as they went so now Chuck Schumer is going to drop three million dollars in what should have been a safe Democrat seat\nThree million dollars you know it probably could use some of that thirty eight million that ... has raised mark my words when this election is over\nBeto O'Rourke in Texas will be sitting on a huge chunk of change if he only wanted to win\nThe Senate seat from Texas He would spend every penny of it but he won't and he hasn't and the reason is made on knows he can't win a seat\nThe more money they spend the further he falls behind he'll end up losing fifty five forty or it might even be fifty six forty four he'll lose about ten percentage points he's down consistently by seven points or more and then you have to factor in the turnout model remember that when\nThey show these polls they don't just randomly interview six hundred to a thousand people\nThey have estimates on what percentage of people are going to be Republicans and what percentage you're going to be Democrats that show up to vote they have estimates on percentage of old people and young people that are going to show up to vote may have estimates on city and in rural\nAnd so they go find that many votes that many poll respond to ease\nBut what you can't factor in is the people that they model show up and vote\nIn the yard signs don't vote rallies don't vote\nYou have a rally on the campus of a university which has been hitting hard over\nThe last month and some people are coming out of class in camera and says to Morgan says\nChloe hey what are you are you going to the food court for lunch no they're having a political rally oh well what are you going to that yeah it'd be fined must go I haven't been to one\nOh it's going to be what it was and what is it like a debate or no no it's had begun oh oh oh I saw him on TV well Chloe I'm kind of sweet on you if I go well you'd think I'm like a mature adult man and you'll sleep with me\nWell at a local eatery and after being knocked out when he was punched ... bell and hit his head on the floor I was so
