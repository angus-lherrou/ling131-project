crab in a bucket theory is or phenomena it's not just a theory it's a phenomena\nBecause it's a fact happens\nBlack people know what it is because black people have witnessed the crime in a bucket phenomena is that black people are like crabs in a bucket\nIf one of them starts climbing to where he is getting to the edge of the bucket to get hold of it and get out the other crabs beneath him will grab him with their pinchers pull him back down\nSo you know a Isaac Newton famously said if I have seen further it is only by standing on the shoulders of giants\n\nNo Ramon not one set of footprints let me promote pleased about interest when I'm trying to uh say smart stuff\nIsaac Newton was referencing the fact that\nScience builds on what comes before it\nEverything is in one way or another derivative of what happens before it and that's what Newton was recognizing\nAnd whether it's Kanye West or Jay Z or anybody else we're products of the art if we're artists that came before us if we're scientists we're products of the science that came before us\nScientists today don't have to devote their careers to figuring out Archimedes principle\nThey don't need to spend their time understanding gravity and the gravitational pull pi has already been established\nThey have a scientific method a rigorous means by which things are tested the global warming crowd out to try this\nAnd so you start having all these things already I mean if you're a writer you start with the fact that language has already been established the use of language to language turns of language turns of phrase all of these things\nBut there is in black pop culture there is the inability to add to what was before because of the tearing down so many black artists have to spend their time re establishing their bona fides\nAnd there's a reason for that\nAnd if you want to use slave analogies here's where you can use them here's where you get into references of house negroes here's where you get into references\nThat I Do think go back a long time they go back\nOver ... over a century ago century and a half some cases more this\nIdea of a black man daring to have an opinion outside that of other black\nPeople and the reason is because if black struck having their own opinions than the white liberals won't be able to count on a hundred percent of them in the white liberals have built their coalition\nOn needing disarmed me and when the army desserts see that's\nWhy that's why they put somebody behind the army and shoot the disorder\nAnd that's why you would spare three men per hundred to shoot the disorders because if one starts peeling off ill encourage the others and before you know it you've lost all hundred of your infantry well that's the way it is with blacks\nAnd that's why the white liberals are very careful do let black folks think for themselves if black folks start thinking independently look I don't expect a hundred percent of black people to vote Republican\nBut you can't tell me it's healthy for a hundred or Ninety nine percent of blacks to vote Democrat you can't tell me there wouldn't be anybody black that would like Donald Trump and I guess that would be okay if they weren't popular in pop culture and ... has been so here CNN's panel\nTell you what is what happens when negroes don't read 'em and and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and say pitchers [noise]\nThat's [laughter] let's say black\nFolks are about to pray Kanye West and the

named\n... new new and and now some damage you know we only shows\n... alone when you go in one meaning no\nWe don't debate public policy in this country [noise]\nIf we did Democrats would where would rarely win\nBecause the actual policies they promote or not terribly popular believe it or not higher taxes higher taxes are not popular\nVery few people actually want higher taxes well can you find the ... bit I think it was from last\nWeek where he talked about increasing your taxes\nSo he's being asked if you're a member of the Senate\nYou'd rollback those tax cuts and he realizes\nThis is starting to get you know Texans like lower taxes so then he starts talking about everybody paying their fair share we're paying two little\nYou people are paying to little in taxes listen to this day hell yes we're going to roll back ...\nTo generate the revenues to invest in people\nAnd to make sure that we're not continuing to spend into ever greater that we'd have to make sure that everyone paying their fair share now the corporate tax rate just went from thirty five percent appointing one percent on how to go all the way back up where it was but I Do think it needs to be higher than where it is right now\nThey need to invest do you think government can spend your money more efficiently than you can\nJust simple as that\nIf a corporation makes the dollar do you think they should have to give a greater percentage of that dollar to the government or use it themselves because the corporations just an entity oh sure some of their executives are going to make money there's no doubt about that but guess what else are going to do\nSome of that they're going to redistribute his dividends to shareholders and that means teachers and firefighters and police officers and plant workers that have four one K. is you're going to get some money they're some of them\nAre going to show greater profitability Greta returns and that means that their stock price is going to increase and that means that if you share that if you sell those shares you make\nMore you know their shares you were buying every month as part of your retirement plan some of those companies can spend\nMore money some of them can hire more people\nSome of them can pay bonuses to their employees and have\n... says as does the Democrat Party that those companies need to give that money to the government you make more money you need to give more to the government so that they can invest in people public unions teachers unions\nWelfare recipients illegal aliens who've come here\nI don't think that's a winner so that's why they do and people like this have to campaign on things like aren't I and nice\nGuy I ride a skateboard I Do air drums I've visited all the counties you want to take my money well yeah but I'm a super great kind of super cool and the kids all love me\nI'm really popular on university campuses and here I Am hanging out with a rapper and and you know Willie Nelson endorsement and you know these Hollywood uh actors in some some really cool people that live in New York\nWith the people of Texas work hard farmers work hard and what they what they make they want to keep and they don't need a friend\nOr an autograph from a famous person\nThey want somebody to go to Washington DC and say we're not taking more of these people's money if we could focus on the issues at hand when when the elections if we can get the personalities the cult of personality the celebrities\nIn their endorsements and the comedians and the musicians in the movie stars and the media would never lose an election [noise]\nMarried show [noise]\n\nFox News I'm Chris posture at least two people have been killed by trees falling on homes in hurricane Michael in Florida in Georgia their roofs than other pieces of debris scattered from miles around the Florida Panhandle\nGot Caesar's from people's houses flying by you got three flying law like say ... it was probably the worst\nDamage appears to

federal appeals court has granted him a stay of execution so judges can consider whether he had poor legal representation during his trial and sentencing that's Fox is jak Callahan\nThis is Fox News [noise]\n\n\n\n\nOwned by\nWhite\nHouse Patty I'm sure I\nGet most of the polling data Shelley [noise]\nThis will pull from Democrats and libertarian candidates will pull from Republicans if if there could be a ... if there could be a credible Green Party candidate in every major election\nThe Democrats would suffer I mean look at look at what a Nader did to\nAl Gore but for Ralph Nader running in two thousand Al Gore would have one that we wouldn't have ... you wouldn't have known as the secretary of state was in Florida there would have been no hanging chads that races over\nLet's turn to Tennessee ... my prediction at this point unless something dramatic changes my prediction at this point is\nThat Arizona goes to Martha McSally that a Republican holes that seat which would be important\nThe national folks are or are weighing in and helping where they can make Sally plays nice with the establishment so she's not a candidate that the establishment is going to turn on\nKick her out of the boat so my guess is they pour some resources in their toward the end they really focus on her military record which is impressive um they focused on keeping that seat Republican\nAnd she's a woman if it were if she were a man that she could be hit by a woman as you know we need another woman in the Senate but she's not\nSo if if I were to say right now I think Arizona holes that seat Republican Tennessee has been an interesting seat during all of this Marsha Blackburn the congressman\nAppears to have pulled out in front I don't know how you pronounce this guy's name breeds and I see it written but I don't I don't know how you breathe isn't or breeds and B. R. E. D. E. S. E. him it doesn't matter\nBecause Martha Marsha Blackburn is going to win that\nRight now a Fox News or let's say a New York times had a live poll the New York times is doing this deal where they're calling people and ask the calls come in they're posting them which is an interesting kind of a real time it's almost like when Frank Luntz\nDoes the the uh the the surveys where they have you know six or eight or ten or twenty people and and they have the meters\nAnd as they vote you get to see you know like you get to watch them watch a debate and see what they like and don't why well this thing's pretty neat what what New York times is doing I just don't trust the New York times but they've got um\nThey've got Blackburn with a twenty point lead\nUm\nThey've got her with a with a sorry an Eighteen percentage point lead fifty seven thirty Matt Tennessee is a red state it's a Republican state this is Bob Corker seat\nTennessee has been cursed with to squish Republicans\nCorcoran Lamar Alexander and I think Tennessee is a more conservative state than the senators they've had they've had Jeff Flake style senators and I think the state is much more\nConservative than that I just do once you get outside of Nashville I don't think Nashville itself is is terribly conservative as most big cities are and it's a big city full of artist so I think you've got a bunch of\nYou got a bunch of granola conservative types skinny jeans wearing a liberal folks who liked to act like their country but they're actually Austin, Texas or San Francisco liberals\nAnyway I think Marsha Blackburn winds at the national media has fallen for the issue that that uh\nTaylor Swift has broken her silence on politics and she's done with the mob demanded she's gone with a Democrat\nInterestingly a Democrat who in two thousand five had some serious sexual harassment allegations in his office\nAnd she did this just after the Kavanaugh hearings so that's kind of an odd choice and by the way the guy she went for said he would have voted yes for Kavanaugh because he sees riding on the wall he's looking at the same polling number we are except he's looking at a lot more polling numbers\nRemember these guys have a lot more polling data up to date sooner than you do so by the time you see a poll that says hey Heidi Heitkamp losing in North Carolina I mean in in North Dakota\nHeidi Heitkamp the Democrat incumbent is losing in North Dakota and the people of North Dakota want Kavanaugh by the time you see it she's had it for days she's had time to change her opinion or change our public positions\n\nNever forget how much polling data these people have access to in real time they pay people a lot of money to do focus groups and see where they should come down on these issues\nAnd they don't make a statement on it before that and I'll tell you this I'm Glad Susan Collins when with with a Kavanaugh\nBut I'll guarantee you Susan Collins was looking at polling data that showed that the people in her state one and Kevin no\nThat doesn't minimize how difficult it was for her as a woman to come out in favor of him especially when she was targeted so heavily\nBut it does mean that the support is there and and that they can talk about Susan Rice running against or they can run Taylor Swift or Susan Rice or a Lena Dunham or whoever else they want to drag out the fact\nIs the fact is Susan Collins is popular in Maine Susan Collins voted with the conservatives and the state of Maine has a fierce streak of independence\nAnd they don't like to be bullied by\nOther folks so when Susan Collins comes out and says they tried to illegally bribe me\nWhen stories appear about them sending three thousand coat hangers to her when she has to take back alley entrances to get into the Capitol when she talks about how awful it is man and she's been intimidated and threatened\nMaybe Susan Collins is paying people to do that because you are absolutely positively ensuring that she's going to be reelected I'm kidding she's not she's not a paying people to do that but she is having to put up with help from the left\nAnd if they think they're going to bully this woman into ... she's no she doesn't sit down when she pays like Jeff Flake does she's not going to be intimidated [noise]\nAnd she's going to be reelected in twenty two [noise]\nOff enough
