... behind him and she was holding her hand on her on the uh the bend in her elbow\nAnd she had her three fingers her middle finger her ring finger in her pinky out the kind of grasping the elbow

together maybe apply pressure low low relief\nThat she probably didn't even know she was doing\nThey saw that video that picture and the left made that out that she was flashing a white power symbol on national TV [noise] that was a dog whistle to the white power community you remember that that poor woman was caught up\nIn all of that nonsense\nThat's where we started before they started the

reference to the fact that\nSeveral liberal left the commentators over the weekend declared that having lost the ... the the Kavanaugh battle\nDemocrats and the left rather than learning their lesson rather than respecting the institutions and allowing them to work made references to taking the gloves off ruthless that\nThe law of the land Planned Parenthood still mostly funded education policy

of people came along willing to say no\nAnd that has made all the difference [noise] you know what made all the difference in the cabin off I there was a moment along the way when I saw a number of Republicans\nSay it's time that Kavanaugh withdraw for the good of himself his family the Trump presidency the Republican brand and\nThe court to which he would be serving\nIts time he withdraw that was that was the message that is the ...\nThat is the ... at the core of Republicans the fear of the fight\nIf Trump has done one thing more than any other in his time as president and ascending to the presidency\nIt is that he has taught Republicans that it's okay to push back it's okay to believe something deeply enough that when they accuse you of the worst\nIntentions you keep fighting when they hit you hit back you don't run and hide\nYou don't walk away\nBecause what they do the first time when they succeed they'll do in spades\nBecause it works it's why you don't settle

your high school yearbook\nAnd whether that's supposed to be some code like most of us are ready to move on from that it's not particularly productive talk and frankly it should've never come up but I Do want to address something\nI have had more conversations about\nKavanaugh confirmation process then I have\nMost any political issue in quite some time going back to the two thousand sixteen primaries actually one of the things I noticed was how many women it's actually over half of the women with whom I talked about the Kavanaugh hearings\nClaimed to be a victim\nOf sexual assault not just sexual harassment sexual assault\nAnd\nThat's an interesting phenomenon I'm not saying it's not true I'm not saying even one of them made it up\nI'm saying that if it is true if it is true ah first of all it's a real problem in our society\nHere is the problem here is the conundrum the dilemma this is a very difficult discussion to half\nBy design there are people who have complicated this conversation and made it difficult to talk openly about it and it is unhealthy as a society\nTo put your head in the sand and say well we just won't talk about it because it will upset\nPeople so I'm going to do my best to do so and I'm going to share with you my perception as to what has happened\nFirst of all some women\nPerceived the Kavanaugh case not as the evidence as it was presented but they perceived it through the lens of their own case\nWhich they only wanted\nTo focus on\nAnd if you didn't believe Christine forward then that would mean you don't believe them\nSo air go they\nHave to believe Christine Ford in order to ensure that they will be bullied\nThat the left has been more on hinged under Trump\nThan I recall in my lifetime in my lifetime\nAnd and I think that includes a during Watergate in my lifetime I mean I I don't claim I could process what happened in Watergate I'm I'm reading from from historical sources but I'm\nIn my lifetime I don't recall the left being as angry or bitter and vicious as they have been toward everything Trump and yet he just got his second Supreme Court nominee on on the bench\nOf the many incredible miraculous things that President Trump has died and this is nothing short of America what he's got them but he's done it in the face of constant\nWarning and lying ... feral attacks on him and his person and his people they're facing his cabinet members and his staff at a restaurant\nThey're sending their spending at a private information of senator he has expose the hypocrisy and the ineptitude of the loyal opposition dining deck and That's Senator Spartacus and people are tuning in\nAnd they say these people I'm like\nWho is this Blumenthal guy who's ... or or or their Ellison who is what is the standard we don't even wanna there now is that you can hear why you're offering being beat up and your medical records and you know cooperation on Brett Kavanaugh and you're just blowing up his life and it's not I don't like that are\nReally that transcends politics\nI think that's true\nI think that's that's absolutely true her husband um\nJames Carville Mitt for\nDonald Trump when when Ted Cruz first went in the Senate when Ted Cruz shut down the government fighting against Obamacare James Carville had this to say about him\nI think is a multi talented and fellow Republican politician I've seen in the last Thirty years after the fact that he's going to run for president and he is going to create something I'm not sitting here saying he's got to win and I think that matters right I\nListen listen to this excess of the states in South Carolina he touches every button and this guy has no fear\nIn just since ... and he is going to be something to watch him and a lot of Republicans feel this way going and you hear this a lot if we only got someone who was are picking up and was for what we will fall we went elections and we get these John McCain's needs Mitt Romney's and these guys and handyman thing well one thing this guy's not easily\nAnd that is true one thing Romney is he is squishy and McCain was ... and that's why they lost Obama and I said it this morning I'll say it again\nWhat Donald Trump has taught Republicans to do is to fight what he's taught them to do is to play to win\nDon't just show up and keep your uniform clean don't be proud of what a nice team picture you can take after the game because you have no dirt\nOn your leg ins because you look like you didn't you never slid into the base leave it all on the field\nWhat Trump has talked Republicans to do is what the left has been doing for a long time and that is played a win win there was a moment when Kavanaugh look like his candidacy his nomination was in\nPeril\nIt looked like it would just be easier for him to step back and there were a number of folks Bill Kristol the editor of the Weekly Standard there were a lot of those folks\nA lot of the Georgetown salon Republicans who said\nLet's just pulled his back is it that this has gotten to ugly it's gotten too ugly to nasty and I'm a it let's just let's just pull this thing back we don't we don't need to ah we don't need to win this uh this\nMuch ... it's a ... it's bad for the court bad for the Trump presidency is bad for the Republican brand you know I Will say this and it it deserves to be said\n[noise] I have\nAn absolutely profound respect\nFor the way that Mitch McConnell handled this process\nI have an in during ... amount of respect for the way Mitch McConnell handled this process but I Will tell you\nIt required that he and Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz stay the course\nBut the left so miss played their hands I remember when the ... uh Julie sweat the\nDetails lurid details came out\nAnd people that are normally pretty resolute said to me is just too much there's too many too many this is the third person coming out against him now this is bad and these are really bad I said wait a say these are so bad as to stretch credibility I don't believe these are true\nAnd now the Democrats are blaming ... they're blaming the fact that ... at that point his details were so over the top so ridiculous that it became clear\nOh no they're now that they're just absolutely making stuff up and not even trying to cover it we may have fear they might be able to go out and find fifty more women\nAnd then of course miss sweating and her her whole life story started getting out there and her ex boyfriend and and the threat she made against him and then her employer and and the thing she did there and then she had her own problems and remember we never heard from Mr Mir as again either\nThose were the things what's\nGoing to be fascinating what I Hope will be the case is that Republicans will remember what happened and not soon forget because we are\nTwenty nine days from the mid term election [noise]\nUnder Trump they're out creating those stories and he understands that game so well that what he does is he gives them other stories he gives them side stories it's sort of like well\nThere was a story about one of my favorite college football coaches Mike Leach\nAnd back he's at Washington state now but back in the day\nIs he at Washington state or Washington I think it's Washington state in it just Washington you sure check that I think is Washington state but when he was a when he was at\nOklahoma um\nI think the year was night he Ninety nine is Washington state yeah OK when he was in Oklahoma they were playing University of Texas a big red river shootout and\nHe created this fake offensive scheme the first few plays that the ... was going to be running\nAnd he accidently dropped it on the ground and didn't notice he dropped it and let the uh assistant coaches for the University of Texas pick it up so they planned their defense because they couldn't believe this treasure trove had been dropped on them\nThey plan their defense they they they went ahead and cold air defenses schemes for the first few plays around defeating what the office was going to do\nBut leach always two steps ahead had actually created a set of plays that if you defended those plays the way he knew they would defend them it would actually\nLeave his guys wide open for the plays he actually called so his team went up Seventeen nothing over the University of Texas before the UT coaches realized we've been had that's what Trump is doing\nOn many occasions he is creating a situation he is creating a potential conflict\nBecause they know they they live the media lives to cover that conflict Trump is creating a potential conflict and then he doesn't deliver the conflict\nHe he does something other than deliver that conflict Fox News was reporting as well CNN I Can't remember if it was last Thursday or the Thursday before it's the day the president was sharing the um U.N Security council meeting\nWas a very\nEventful substantive news day and yet they covered Kevin all the whole time you know we could probably spend a couple of shows talking about what Trump has done in the last month that I'll bet you most people don't know anything about\nCanada signing on to an updated NAFTA to point out\nOn our terms when they were they wouldn't that's consequential that's\nMeaningful that is a victory for Trump and that's why they don't talk about that is a victory for Trump on a serious serious foreign policy issue\nRelations with North Korea and peace on the Korean Peninsula you know when it when it first started when that process first started it looked like it was going to develop do you remember what

in elections\nThe goal was to provide information to the press the FBI and the Senate goal in other words was to try to harm the Trump regime\nSo George Soros was putting up some big money to ensure
