white liberal bail roared and here's to MSNBC commentators last night talking about him and how they raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter and the more money he raises the worst she's doing\nThe work is just blowing the roof off with small dollar donations thirty million in the last three months alone he spent ... million already on TV ads against Ted Cruz but the latest New York times poll shows him trailing proven by eight points\nAnd does quite often down now and what he's he's he's achieved for that money as he is now the most unpopular statewide official in the er state wide figure in the state in Texas is that what's going on here yet is he is absolutely because he has sort of national figure he's taken stance that to a great job raising money from a national liberal base\nBut always done it's just ... money that would have gone to Heidi Heitkamp or Claire McCaskill or other Democrats could have saved their seats that are probably not going to go down in the\nWild workers on this vanity mission and it's just that it's just basically flushing money down the toilet Jason\nFrom a from a very real standpoint there are a lot of Democrats who would love nothing more I hear it all the time when I'm Out in the campaign trail they would love to think Ted Cruz looms sending money but it's kind of have\nThat we literally just having a conversation and\nI was like ward made a mistake by nationalizing this campaign look me in terms of all about the state you're in you want to take your debate and put it on a national cable networks you want it to be

matter\nIt mattered to her career it got are hired and promoted and that's what's wrong with the playing these games in an article in the Fordham law review\nIn uh Nineteen Ninety five\nThe author writes there are a few women of color who hold important positions in the academy fortune five hundred companies or other prominent fields or industries this is not in consequential\nDiversifying these arenas in part by adding qualified women of color to their ranks remains important for many reasons for one there are scant women of color as role models\nIn my three years at Stanford law school there were no professors who were women of color Harvard law school hired its first woman of color Elizabeth Warren in Nineteen Ninety five\nElizabeth Warren a woman of color could have she's one one thousand American indian which they didn't actually use Indian blood compare\nAgainst but hey let's assume she is in fact one one thousand American\nIndian [noise] I don't want to take that away from her but does that make her a woman of color [noise] why do we qualified people as a woman of color\n[noise] why is that important it's important that she had been perceived in that way because it got her hired on\nIt gave her an extra qualification but here's the problem faculty positions like most other things particularly in public life in in in in government faculty positions or a zero sum game\nIf Elizabeth Warren got that job then that means someone else didn't\n[noise] and even if you buy into the nonsense that you need to have women of color on the faculty for the sole purpose of being a woman of color or not because that person is the best but if you say well we got to hire us one non white woman\nAnd here comes this white woman I'm a non why why why don't you have your side so\nThat's why she has to maintain the lie because her whole career is based on that why you see that she's two and she's into deep at this point she can't get out\nBut the worst part is\nSome black woman some Hispanic woman out there didn't get that teaching job because white liberal Elizabeth Warren did the white liberals always on the minority\n[noise] you've got your\nDaughter

whole ... next month the city will vote on proposition C\nWhich will raise over three hundred million dollars to add to the already three hundred eighty million dollars per year the city spends on their homeless problem\nHowever instead of a levy on the number of employees proposition C is essentially another income tax for companies that call the city home\nThe new mayor of San Francisco London Breed has said she has problems with the lack of accountability in the measure apparently the proposition does not provide enough checks and balances on how to account for the three hundred million dollars raised oh don't worry how the money spent\nJust make sure we got a law that nobody ever looks at how we spend the money on the homeless it's all how we can get more of a\nQuote by dramatically increasing our homelessness spending without working with neighboring counties proposition C could put us in the tenable she says the untenable inexpensive position\nOf funding services for residents from other counties [noise]\nSan Francisco cannot solve homelessness simply by writing ever larger checks itself\nThere is a limit to what we should and can spend oh Mitt\nAll what you can spend on the homeless oh no this can't happen there can never be a limit to what you spend\nThe children on the homeless on the environment there is an unlimited amount because rich people [noise] apparently um\nMayor breathe has figured out that the more money you spend on homelessness which by the way this is true\nThe more homeless you have I've told a story on air before so forgive me if you've heard this multiple times but Ted Koppel did a special used in a few years ago I was in the city council at the time we have to be there\nAnd it was comparing homelessness in Houston to homelessness in San Francisco and they took to people who were homeless in San Francisco and two people who were homeless in Houston and they compared the resources [noise]\nIf you're homeless in Houston you can sleep on the street which violates are vague when she lost or you can go to one of the I'm a non profit organizations like star of hope great organization that\nWill take you in and put you give you a three ... you can eat and keep the rain and cold off of you [noise] um\nAnd it's the basics right you're homeless but it it's enough to keep you alive at its it's humane compassionate it is Christian literally it is a Christian based organization and then there are some others but star hope is probably the most prominent in ... I think probably the most effective\nIn the greater Houston community so the homeless guys in in Houston they get a place to stay and they get food um and that's that's it right because we were not really believe you know we're not going to build\nA castle for you and then they went to the to homeless people they chose at random in San Francisco and life was really good they were getting so much more\nIn fact the homeless outreach there it's almost as if they make homelessness inducted into a job being homeless is like your career can live pretty well off of it\nBut I don't tell you that the point that out because you would have expected the city of San Francisco rather than spending on roads and police and the things that matter it's going to have higher taxes\nAnd more goodies for the homeless\nIn fact so many goodies for the homeless that some people\nWho are homeless ended up moving from places like Houston to San Francisco for a better job if you will the job of being homeless\nThe two people they chose were from Houston\nThey were homeless from Houston the homeless like every other community has their network they pass\nInformation the kittens good in San Francisco\nSo they hop a greyhound bus and they get to San Francisco and they immediately show up signing up no questions asked and they have a whole new career and beautiful San Francisco\nAnd what
