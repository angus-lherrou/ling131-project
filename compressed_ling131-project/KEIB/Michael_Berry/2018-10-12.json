quick it's just a quick question I Know you know\nPrior to the election Trump getting elected sixteen you know there were a lot of people that were just like you know\nOvertly coming out the sport now as the as the debate went on you know kind of hard to determine and he went on the attack I'm listening to show you know ever since you've been on here I\nRemember ... when he ran for mayor\nOr [laughter] anyway\nWhen you know you're you're out and march made it work what do you feel like in this upcoming election that there's folks like yourself\nThat you know maybe you can see things that he'd be that great ... turning around dreams off all that what's your what's your opinion on\nA you know here's the pro um it's hard to have that conversation\nI have come to the conclusion that my opinion of Donald Trump is not particularly important it's just not um\nAnd for me to express what is a very complicated\n\nA response to him and his work is probably beyond the medium\nIn October of two thousand eight and I don't know that is particularly productive I Will say this um I did not wish for Trump to fail was not my goal\nI believed that Trump would be an awful president I Believe that he would\nBe sort of a Jeff Flake\nA guy who got elected as a Republican governor as a Democrat I believed that in good faith based on his past\nI didn't ... it was it that I was ignorant of the life of Donald Trump I had done a lot of research and I believed that he would be awful but\nI hoped he would be good and\nThe reason is I don't let my ego\nGet in the way of the much bigger issue I'm going to be dead and gone and my children are going to be my age and I want them to live in a great country\nAnd I don't think that that's a fait accompli I don't think that it's naturally the case that this country will be great thirty five years from now just because we've always been great I think we have to make good decisions\nMe being\nA man\nA man\nMan\nMan oh\nOr the time that racism in America style man it's time\nThat black people stop beating up on other black people who dare to have an opinion it's time that the stupid black people stop bullying the smart black people\nIt's time that the clowns who've been owned by the Democrat Party stop attacking black people who don't get sucked into being a Democrat\nKnows plenty of black people who are investment bankers entrepreneur

anyone wondering Ramon offended me earlier today [noise]\nEmbarrass a lot of people but it's not made me do that right now so I'm you\nKnow these black people who claim black lives matter that's not what that means that means thugs who tried to kill cops shouldn't be killed by the cops who defend themselves\nWhy can't we all just said what is the truth and stop worrying if the leftist mad\nMost people believe Christine forward lied and they know that the Democrats were going to do anything to destroy this guy\nMost people know that oh most not every most every black guy gets killed by a cop

sure whether the term came out as bubble\nUm what David go ahead and he called it a bubble that's actually um\nYou know let's let's speak more about that Dr share that's why I'm calling I mean there are so many things that I could say about to have David about his life\nOr about the blessings of his life that how many people were involved in creating the fast life for David that we possibly could there were a lot of people\nBut for a period of about four years we did not have any knowledge it and so there was a long search and David ... you know\nNew as she grew about why he was isolated why all of his items had to be sterilize he knew that this long search for an immunologist because\nWe spend a lot of time at home so we were you know we're very close\nHe would say to me do we have an immunologist next yes and he would ask because he knew that you may knowledge it's would also be his doctorate record right and he had an interim tradition but he ... he was not an immunologist\nAnd though and I would say no David not yet you know they're still searching well you know they might get the right doctor so I'm In Nineteen Seventy eight it was announced that they had found a physician doctor when she share\n'em and down so friendly you know David nodded affirmative that he was happy that we had a doctor so I'm not sure from the announcement times at the time he met David\nBut I'm David Was at home at the time and not David interim tradition Dr Nichols rock Dr share to our home\nAnd um I was and I wanted to make a good impression and so you know I scurried around do you think that the house at night instructed David to scurry around and do a few things inside as bubbles so we could make a good impression\nAnd I'm Down to share came in eight and I didn't know it at the time but she he's very humble man and he walked in to we had a living room dining room combination and that's how we were able to how the multiple bubbles plus it's huge play room that now that had designed for David\nAnd I'm sure Dr share walked a quietly into um the area where David Was and I followed and I introduce Dr share to David and David looked at him I'm not sure what if you're looking at any photos that rainy photos\nYou ... you can you tell which one it was on\nThe CBS did a forty years retrospective and there's a picture of Dr Shearer with he's up against the isolate er and David is looking forward to the east coast the doctors were kind of looking lovingly at him\nYes they are to pro is my favorite picture it's a profile picture of both of them and yet Dr share has his hand\nHe reached up and and and Christ is hand against the bubble and instinctively David Netflix hand so for a few seconds that was their first contact and the other hand that David I might add with ... it was almost as if he was you know interviewing doctors share\nBut ... they had a wonderful relationship and I have to say you know\nThat doctors years past being a ... yeah I was a great loss and I'd only for David family\nBut for the entire primary Indian community\nHe um he learned a lot from it all day that you know there was no protocol to follow\nA there was no books too you know to reach you understand how science handled the last bubble boy David Was that first and only\nSo you know there were many things that he had to decide in advance of the next step that David Was coming
