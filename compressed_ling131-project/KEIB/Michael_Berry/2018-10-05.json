easy on me get a leg or a day and get back to the moment starts working in one hour available at the pharmacy counter\nMarried and we have a twenty year old son and you really don't have much of the savings to speak of no no I get by four or five months something like that but but I'm I'm concerned about retirement\nFirst of all that you have four or five months save for a rainy day give yourself some props that's good that's a healthy chunk that very few Americans actually have but you said something else that I Would be more distressed about so you have no money right now save for retirement\nYou know that there is a good time I was retired from the army for Twenty years from Tony years of service so thank\nYou for your service\nThank you and thank you for you what you do for anybody to listen to [laughter] so I have that and that's a lifelong benefits for me where I work also has a retirement that will be eligible to collect and they're like two and a half years so there will be income coming in\nWhen I Try to figure out what to do with it and most places I Do the research you know if it's just they're trying to get you to buy a product and you pay for that product you know leave without it or [laughter] or some of the stuff that just so confusing talk\nRight well I can make it so easy with you being fifty five and you're married\nSingle or married married and um how old is your wife\nShe usually on the side\nRight so you are eligible to put aside up to sixty five hundred dollars into a Roth IRA each year\nThat I'm aware of it is just not a consideration

thousand into a Rafi cheer\nYou know certainly does not I'd like her to have her own okay\nWith her being forty five she's got more time to build up some money and that would be a priority how are you been able to come up with four to five months of rainy day fund so you're living on less than what\nBe with the Democrats but neither side is going to let you\nA a walk that line in the middle\nJim hot towers screaming populist liberal in Texas history had a way with words and he wrote a book that said there's nothing in the middle of the road except for dead armadillos ah except for yellow stripes and dead arm of the bill as I think was the line and that's just it there's there's no room for the middle of the road candidacy today\nThe idea of the moderate you know Lindsey Graham oh what a good week this has been for Lindsey Graham\nLindsey Graham was on Sean Hannity's show the other day I've listened to hand the five minutes in the last\nThree weeks and it was such good ... it was the best five minutes probably of his show because he had Lindsey Graham on and Lindsey Graham was going at it and Lindsey Graham was talking about the swamp\nAnd he was saying that you know what the swamp would normally do is kicked Kavanaugh out of the boat into the water throw him overboard\nAnd I'm thinking to myself Lindsey Graham is the most ... swamp figure there's ever been\nBut he has gone absolutely Tea Party populist conservative guy over this issue and I\nLove it\nHe was telling reporters\nEarlier today that he's going to vote for judge Kavanaugh hey I Am ready to vote I'm ready I'm ready now by the way they've called cloture vote\nAnd the theory goes that McConnell would not call a vote for cloture which means to close the the discussion and vote unless he had his votes I don't know that in this case that's necessarily true and I'll tell you why in a minute but\nUm that vote could be as early as friday I think it's going to happen on Saturday\nIt looks like well I'm going to go through some of the senators that we were worried about and\nAs of right now here we are Thursday or as of right now it looks like the vote I if I were guessing\nI Would guess the votes going to be fifty four forty six um there are some estimates that have it at fifty five forty five but don't underestimate the Hail Mary the left is going to throw now that they know that they have no chance of winning\nThey're going to get desperate right they're going to try for a knockout punch and and\nIn some ways that scares me because that means they're literally going to stop at nothing\nIt it means that the things they're going to try are going to be nuclear options it means that they're going to try things they never would have tried before because it's their only hope\nIt means that all their trickle ration all their their shenanigans it means that things that you would typically say no if we do that and we lose it it will\nYou see what's interesting about this don't let me forget to tell you in the next segment Ramon what what\nWhat ... what I'm\nLindsey Graham did I'm so you know what folks I I'm going to confess to you I'm embarrassed\nI'm like a kid on Christmas Eve can we just open the president I can we at least open the stuff that's under the tree and whatever saying he brings\nTonight will open tomorrow but can we just over I'm so excited right now I Am so invigorated an exhilarating over what I think's about to happen almost Kavanaugh's nomination [noise]\nSay something nice you can always said on the Michael berry show\nIf you love football yelling at television screens with friends and wearing clothing with someone else's name on it [noise] there's a seat waiting for the\nSome of them may leave on the [noise]\nOn now some of them may mean some of these [noise]\nLindsey Graham telling reporter ... ready to vote and he wants to vote now more than ever to confirm Kavanaugh\nHe's excited about it and then some cat lady in the background starts screaming shrieking this is\nI Am lucky I've been with my wife since I was Eighteen years old she's very good to me she makes me a better person she is a time she's the kind of person I Wish I was she's kind\nShe's genuine she's secure in herself she has nothing ill to say of other people she has no neurosis sees she's not envy is she's not pride full she's just kind\nAnd so I don't know what it's like to go through a divorce other than feeling like I've gone through a few with my friends over the years\nAnd it always seems that a person that was otherwise a nice person when they're going through a divorce you see the worst of um you you see that the fangs come out in the clause go up\nWell this woman who's screaming is what I imagine every man out there kind of pictures for their ex wife\nShe's this shrieking heartbeat of a cat lady and she starts screaming about Kavanaugh having to take a polygraph she wants cabin ought to take a polygraph she screeching and screaming and just\nHe knows that Feinstein knows better he knows that Blumenthal knows better he knows what he's doing is he is watching people that he likes he has said this over and over again these are his friends\nLindsey Graham does not despise the Democrats there's no genuine dislike they like each other they're friends it is hard to understand\nHow ... how ... the atmosphere in the United States Senate is to the house is not quite as much but the Senate is a very club the atmosphere these people are friends\nThey are genuinely friends they care about each other now that might sound silly are absurd they're not capable this is their family once they enter the Senate they don't believe\nYou have to understand it has historically been the case when you enter the Senate you stay there until you step down or you die\nAnd the idea has always been hey look we'll put on a show for the public\nBut when it gets down to it we're never going to hurt each other because we're screw around and get each other kicked out of the Senate and lose this this great thing that we have going\nIt's so much more powerful than the house it's it's smaller you get more attention it's pretty it's every six years I mean a president only gets to serve for a four year term\nAnd at most two for your turn a senator doesn't come up again for an election once they once they win and then get reelected they've got six years\nThey don't even have to visit their state they don't have to campaign now they do have to keep raising money because the money that's required to fend off of challenger and then to get reelected if you have a challenger is significant\nBut it is it is a very club the atmosphere they genuinely like Egypt that's why you had this outpouring of love for McCain by the Democrats and Republicans 'cause he's a creature of D.C He's ... he's been there for for as long as I've been alive\nWell I genuinely believe\nOr I Believe that that that Lindsey Graham genuinely believes that he was stabbed in the back by his Democratic colleagues and that he is genuinely authentically I Want to focus on the legitimacy the real ... of his emotions\nBecause most of what they do is theater\nThe disagreements that they have that's all theater with when the door close when the camera's turned off they get a law that was\nGood when you called my side a bunch of Tea Party habits and I called your sided unhinged group a lefty liberals but we're going to have dinner tonight in or hear it in the in the club us club members of the ...\nWell there has been the\nClaws have come out bitchy Lindsey has come out and he means it and and the lobby they don't like this the guys that that that run the government which are not the elected officials\nThe lobbyist for the defense contractors and the different they don't like this real fight this is like a family feud and we can't this is bad for business this is like when the mafia starts making the newspaper shooting each other we can't have this\nWould ask for Bill [noise]\nFox News I'm Chris foster we still haven't heard from a few senators that there are a yes or no and Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a procedural vote this morning to set up a final vote tomorrow the confirmation fight has some Republican voters fired up the new NPR\nPBS Marist Poll sums up their new numbers by saying and I'm quoting here the wide and democratic enthusiasm advantage that has defined the twenty Eighteen campaign up to this point as disappear Cox's\nTraits Gallagher secretary of state Mike Pompeo leaves on a trip to Asia Today starting in North Korea and another meeting with that country's leader Kim Jong\nIs then headed to Japan and South Korea as well as China to discuss the effort to North Korea but tensions have lately worse than China President Trump and vice president Pence both recently accused China of interfering with mid term elections saying China is not what Trump as president because\nHarris Fox is Jessica Rosenthal this is Fox News [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nAnd uh [noise] uh\nSee by\nThe fact is\n\n\n\nWhich Democrats will be credited his saying this but this is a skill that they're about to vote\nFor confirmation I knew it was one of the Democrats I couldn't remember it turns out it was Joe mansion now this is a tip ahead of time that he's going to vote for confirmation rather these guys something can come in at the last\nMinute and I don't mean effect change I I mean a powerful interest can come in and and change their opinion for them at the last minute\nSomebody can say hey you're going to lose you know the endorsement of the biggest union in the state for instance uh are you know they're going to come out and ... but by and large\nIt's probably the case when a senator like Joe mansion in West Virginia a state that that Donald Trump won by ... percentage points it's hard to put into perspective\nWhat kind of pressure this puts on mansion ah who's up for reelection it's hard to put into perspective\nHow fearful he is of losing his Senate seat these guys will do anything to hold on to their Senate seat in the thing and he's got to have a lot of people who voted for Donald Trump\nVote for him a lot of people now even losing by forty percentage points there still thirty percent of West Virginians voted for Hillary so he's got to\nAnd you would just\nBeing watched four or five or six of these there's only one season so far in the new one is that the new and starts this week or no I'm Sorry it it starts November second if\nYou enjoy music and you enjoy Iraq docks and you enjoy the history behind musicians you will enjoy this\nSo they the over arching\nIssue around the Kavanaugh's nomination yes it's a lifetime\nAppointment but\nIs the big issue of the fact that the midterms the voting is going to start and you know ... what are we thirty one thirty two were about thirty days from election day but we're just a few days from early voting\nI'm going to bag and I don't do that or else I'm going to bag our listeners every Texan out there to cast their vote on the first day of\nEarly voting and get your Ted Cruz vote in for a number of reasons I'm not the least of which is to show the left you see the reason they've spent a fortune ...\nIs to send a message to Democrats across the country\nIf we can win Texas we can win anywhere of course the Democrats can win California their politics or lack of course the Democrats can win Oregon of course the Democrats can win New York\nAnd Vermont but if we can break that that red wall\nOf Texas then that means we can begin to take back\nThe new south we can take back those red states we can take back the states of the gun owning conservative rancher suburban night small business owner veteran these are areas they can't crack anymore their politics or to whack\nSo if they could find a candidate a stealth Trojan Horse candidate to send in and they know they can mobilize the left\nThe sort of like West Virginia that ain't going to get you there you've got to be able to convince suburban moms what they called in two thousand what Al Gore and George W. Bush battled over which was the soccer mom\nThey were trying to convince the soccer mom the suburban soccer mom that ... was the guy\nAnd so that's why they had to humanize him you know he loves music he was in a band he said water burger he does air drumming he's just like you he's got a nickname and they needed to excite blacks and Hispanics and young people and that was the recipe and it looked good\nBecause they got a steady dose of earned media from across the country\nRolling Stone magazine took a break from making up UVA a rape case\nA articles which they had to settle for and wrote glowing stories about the New York times wrote glowing stories the national magazine of Texas Texas Monthly which is very liberal but he's read across the state and and well respected they wrote glowing reviews on him\nThe newspapers the Houston Chronicle San Antonio express the Dallas Morning news day all wrote glowing reviews on and bought a great guy and they never talked about his policies because his policies would turn the voters off they didn't want to tell you he's a gun grabber\nThey they actually originally reported on him saying he would vote to impeach a Trump he was the first member of Congress to come out and say he would vote to impeach Trump\nWell at the time he did it he had to mobilize the American left to get excited about the Senate race down in Texas\nAs we've gotten closer and closer to the vote he's embarrassed by that because now the Trump voters some of whom had problems with Ted Cruz because they ran against each other and they were still suffering with bearing the hatch it even though Ted Cruz did and even though Donald Trump did a lot of those voters are now going wait a second\nI don't want the senator from my state leading the charge to impeach my president when he's doing a very good job so that's made people go I'm going to vote against that guy\nThen you've got the Soros money that's come into the state of Texas and that that has really offended people but then you've got this this cabinet case where you know people don't realize how bad it is to live under Democrat tyranny\nUntil they're reminded by having to do it\nYou forget how awful the Democrats are you forget how low morale was in the Obama presidency once he's gone\nBecause it's a coping technique you don't want to have to be negative all the time you don't want to have to have at the top of mind how angry you were at those people and how they treated you\nAnd it's not until you've gotta Kavanaugh case that you see that blew the ring idiot Blumenthal up there it's not until Feinstein is up there is not until Chuck Schumer is holding press conferences it's not until Durban is doing his thing\nAnd uh you know um\nThat sort of thing just reminds people that sort of thing simply reminds\nPeople you know what I got to get out I Know Canada is perfect Ted Cruz is not perfect Donald Trump is not perfect Republicans have a tendency to do something that Democrats don't and that is eat our own we have a tendency to say if you are not perfect\nThen I'll stay home I'll vote for the other side or I'll stay home and that's why we lose elections we should when I've never seen Republicans this United behind an issue\nLike the Kavanaugh's confirmation uh I haven't seen that in a long time in a very long time in in some ways well I I guess the Trump presidency did because they were uniting not just behind Trump but against\nHillary these are invigorating times and it shows the establishment look\nWhen you guys ... look you can win

woman who got choked up and and saying I think she's why I'm not uncomfortable um I was even more sure when she spoke um that she's nuts and that she's lying um and that all of this is acting\nAnd you think that they jumped the shark at the nomination\nOh oh you mean you mean by by uh by coming out against him at the ... yeah they had all oh you're right I forgot about that\nI forgot that is what I wanted to do was go through this process again\nWhen they had um was it national ordinance organization and women are Planned Parenthood they had their press release ready\nBut they forgot to put in the name of the nominee because it didn't matter who it was that person was going to set back women that generation that person was the worst out of over three hundred million people that live in America\nDonald Trump had picked the single worst person for the Supreme Court but since they didn't have the name yet they put all exes in for the name\nAnd then they forgot to go back and fill in the name and they said the press release out which meant it didn't matter who he nominated they were going to pull this nonsense\nWell\nThat's not where I think they jumped the shark I I think people were willing to to give 'em a pass on that in heck I'd forgotten that see this is important that we go back and remember all these things\nI think they jump the shark at the moment they were in quick succession but first there was Ford and Ford was coming off as credible\nBut then in very quick succession we had ... nobody talks about her anymore do you know why because the Democrats are pushing for her because her story fell apart she was the one that said he dropped\nTrial remember he dropped trout at a Yale and showed\nOff the goods and the deal do remember the the deal though was a big part of the of the news cycle and I think the Democrats were very excited by bill does they they love the thought of the especially the men were thrilled about what they could do with the deal do\nAnd and I think they thought that a they'd get to talk about bill does in public which would be exciting for them but be just as important\nI think they thought that that would turn Republicans the Christian right against him right he this is a deal do fella this is a he's wheeled into build though\nHe's a a will do and and they thought man this is going to be it\nWell her story was followed in quick succession by first it was for them there was ...\nAnd then came the big one and that was sweating it the problem is they started ... there was blood and the water it looked like he might not make it there was blood in the water and they thought this is gonna be the one\nBut her story fell apart and in a big way and she turns out to just be an absolute nut and so that made everybody think
