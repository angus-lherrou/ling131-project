mortgage radio show I'm trees is jobs they're back with a mortgage experts John met her be sure to like us on Facebook follow us on Twitter and Instagram for the most up to date financial news and homeowners kids a big thank you to so many of you\nWho found that were capital on line last last week our looking up and that we're capital on Google on consumer affairs on Yelp on Facebook on the better Business Bureau and so many folks called eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight it was just\nA great week and of course network capital\nDid some research they did some pretty sophisticated research actually they wanted to know\nHow was this show doing the people who called how how much were they saving were were were network where are the folks who called really saving 'em enough money to make it worthwhile and what they found was an average monthly savings of five hundred and twenty eight dollars\nAnd of course that comes out to six thousand three hundred and thirty six dollars a year not bad\nFor making a simple phone call to eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight they have mortgage banker standing by right now live we do this every week Sean and that is our two hundred and first\nShell can't believe it and I just want to let you know that if you call that number the person who answers the phone will be\nA mortgage banker and not somebody to take down your information and make an appointment as somebody get back to you know the person to answer the phone will be the person who answers your questions because if you've been listening to our show for a few weeks or a few months or even just today you have\nSome questions like for example what would your specific\nMonthly payment look like if you shorten the term of your loan\nUm but we before we get to that 'cause I I Love talking about short term loans ten years Fifteen Years and how much that can really change change your life in saving money but first before the break John brought in a recent result a family that went from a thirty ... thirty or fix ended up saving\nTwo thousand seven hundred and thirty dollars a month now like I said average savings five hundred and twenty dollars a month but there is just over the top so I was so curious about so many things first of all you mentioned they had thirty one thousand dollars in credit card debt and forty thousand dollars in\nPersonal loans and car notes is that right so they were walking around with this humongous amount of high interest debt\nYeah one thing about that result that I'm really want to do a better job of explaining as as the customer only owed a hundred and two thousand on their house okay so on the personal loans and the car note the ad about forty eight thousand so let's just call it house\nI mean it's truly close so half of the balance what it was more than triple the total monthly payment on those deaths because of the alarm in interest rates so what happened is is a lot of families might not have the best credit position or income position or equity position so they're backed into a corner\nThis family have and take a personal loan and we're going to dive into personal on throughout the show you're going to see why I'm so against it but unfortunately we're having spent over two thousand dollars on just that dead so by eliminating that debt getting a much better interest rate they were able to really achieve maximum\nBenefits so what I like about this result is gone are the days of ... over paying for for these high rates gone or the or the credit card debt\nGone as the days of let's say damage credit so they wipe the financial slate clean\nNow they don't have to worry about things in the past they could focus forward this family now has one payment to make I think you know tell my head was somewhere in the twenty ... twenty dead so we eliminated all into one so\nInstead of writing twenty checks I'd rather just make one low six payment um and that's how this family was able to see so much money no like me I'm In the position with my age I'm thirty five years old I don't really care right now about going back to Thirty years since even twenty seven thirty even though there's a lot I can do a twenty seven hundred dollars in savings with investing\nAnd different aspects out there that a lot of people can teach you guys what to do but I Would actually go with this approach I'm already able to afford to keep my head above water what I'm doing now not a penny more penny less goes out of my pocket but I'm able to pay it off in four years uh Lebanon months member they were sixteen months into a thirty year fix so\nI see much more benefit by by going that route I could have a thing paid off you know before I'm forty years old like an apple find my savings of foreigners Seventy two thousand now I got incredible credit the next car I buy get better you know better rates\nThe next time I Need to go and start a credit card I get better rates if the gift that keeps on giving the month off the mortgage can be used for Christmas\nThey didn't even have to pay for an appraisal so this thing was done in ten business days the Esther refund money is cash money into their pockets so\nThese are the type of results you guys can expect when you dial eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six said now that was more than five times the average savings of her mortgage radio listener so you know for the average\nCustomer when you dial eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six said I Want you expecting the same about six thousand three hundred and thirty six year if you were to do with the thirty year fix cash out pay off some debt and really just said forget it and work with nowhere capitals so I Love their programs I Love the people behind the scenes I loved the business model that they structure and\nI think it's going to be quite a wonderful resolved as time goes on you're going to start seeing this Teresa as rates continue to go up more and more companies are going to either raise their interest rates\nAre even more they're gonna raise their margins are going to\nAdd in lender fees they're going to try to supplement the loss of clientele so I don't want anything to do with that I don't want you guys have anything to do with that and for that reason I Want you to work with nowhere capital dial this number\nEight hundred seven hundred eight zero six said one percent mortgage professionals available at eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight\nAnd one percenters and know how to make it fast how to make it efficient they understand it's your weekend and that you don't want to spend forever on the phone they can help you in terms of a lot of the paperwork gathering using pretty sophisticated software so if that's keeping from calling let me assure you\nThey understand that your time is precious and they can make it real fast and number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight one thing a lot of folks ask about and we touched on it they're curious about at Kenny or Fifteen\nYou're just shortening the term and of course there are tremendous\nBenefits but not everyone is a great candidate a lot of the reason people call the number they want to know what their specific monthly outgo would look like the tenor of the Fifteen I personally think that's a great use for the number\nMaybe it's something you could afford because the rate break can be pretty steep so who's listening should be thinking about possibly going down to maybe a twentieth Fifteen or a tent\nI'd say somebody that likes paying less interest I happen to be one of those guys like\nYou know when you showed me the numbers I was on one of the articles that you found that the difference between eighth thirty or fix any Fifteen year fix was sixty five percent difference on interest alone so that's alarming to me that got me like\nThat was like the stamp of approval with major easily you sold me hardcore on that I'm also I'm a control freak with my mortgage I Wonder when I make a payment I Wanna see principal reduction I Want to see noticeable results I Want to see that this winter something of value not interest I don't want to make it rain of interest on my lender\nLike they're not giving me Christmas cards they're not you know scratch my back they're not there in the time of need so I Want to take control and that's why I Love a shorter term loan I'm also a credit guy I Believe in not only can I help my customer\nTells me a lot but when there are thousands like chains that carries big wait a here's what Jane said by the way you can find these reviews and consumer affairs on Google and Facebook Yelp trust linked better Business Bureau [noise]\nGreat service by in and his team they were always very helpful paid attention to detail and followed up with everything and always return my calls thank you in they were also quite click with the whole procedure\nWell done and I know how much and appreciate this so thank you so much Jane and it sounds like this was a smooth swift\nProcedure I'm how fast does this typically take yeah I mean it's\nAll built around your income your credit your equity or situation I'm really how fast you want to allow this nobody can close faster than ten businesses just so you guys know the laws change\nYou know they kind of stepped in and got really made in our capital room with a parachute other companies it really didn't affect them because they're used to be thirty sixty Ninety day process I could tell you guys constantly from somebody gets to see it on the ground floor\nThere's loans that call in on a Saturday and we already have it under random we already have a process we already have it set up for signing but unfortunately we have to push it out a couple of days because of the law now is really to protect the customers to make sure that\nThey really digest the situation so you can't be too bad but you know running with the parachute does hold them back a little bit but I I'm really sold these guys because of the package deal so\nThere's different aspects that we could talk to you guys about that really makes them more of the you know the number one ranked lender on consumer affairs or what nerd wallet feels about these guys and all these accolades and reviews that they get but you know I'm really big on the complete package I like no lender fees I like fast turned times I like access\nTo amongst the lowest rates in the business people that have a ... a wonderful wonderful portfolio of products that you guys get access to so you know if you really are in a situation you do not know right now one million percent that you are in the best possible position then pick up the phones it's a casual conversation it's easy asked for some of the one percenters\nLike Travis Ramsey Chris go borrow and focused L. O. E. and then we just heard the review from so you know I think it's well worth your time I think you guys should invest maybe five minutes and really find out what position you're in right now could it be better or you over paying what angles we could play to really put you in a better position\nLet's look at maybe I'm putting some money towards the home paying off the debt fixing the credit making

question that many people ask themselves and worried reports dot com did a story on it [noise]\nUm I think it was yeah I wasn't worried she'd you rent\nOr buy I mean I had this question many times in my life and various points both when I was single and I was married when we became parents\nYou think about the school district you wonder how long you're going to be there you think about what's happening to home values and nobody has a crystal ball so what should people know right now we're thinking about buying versus renting\nYeah if you have this question you could easily called eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six they'd\nDo walk you through your specific situation but if you guys want to read all it's a little bit longer in articles I condense it down a ton I'm was going to hit you with the bullet points but go to Doug mortgage reports dot com and they even have videos that describe each different situation but here's a couple of paragraphs that they said is\nThis the decision to buy a home is not an easy one to make fortunately there are some things you can examine about your situation to help you come to a great decision now thinking of buying a home is a long term appreciating that said if you are mobile and moving every couple of years or if you are not sure where you wanted to plant your roots\nThan renting is probably your best option now if you are ready to live somewhere for five plus years and you're ready to plant roots\nThan buying is probably going to be your best option so keep in mind you can always buying rent out the property and makes sense for your area I consider buying if my job was secure or if I can find a similar job in that area that can make me similar amounts of money so\nIf you have questions about which options specifically is best for your family your situation your goals what you're looking to do\nThan all you have to do is make contact or friends over and network capital I\nLove their purchase program they really make sure that they can deliver on the closer best grow date a lot of companies need sixty Ninety Days they deliver on a purchase I've seen some of these and Fifteen twenty two days\nSo we went out on a lot of the businesses just making our priority making sure these realtors can collect collect their cash you can get there you know their their customer in that home at the date that they need so I Am really on board now we're Capitol I Believe in the rates I Believe in their customer service\nI Believe in their products so right now this week we're giving you guys have tenure fix\nThe interest rate is four percent the a P ours for point two five for customers that don't like lender fees for customers that like closing quick the number eight hundred\nSeven hundred eight zero six eight should definitely be utilized I mean already throughout the show I'm guinea notes on the numbers that you guys are are utilizing it seems like everybody's calling in to do cash out for the holidays\nSo keep in mind December is going to come quick we're going to be at Halloween before you blink\nThanksgivings come and then you've got Christmas then you've got New Years then you got you know you you got the the lovers holidays when you get into Valentine's Day and different things like that so\nYou're going to spend a lot of money here over the next couple of months so I recommend paying off these credit cards using a lot of cash you're going to be able to really leverage the home as an investment in a month off the mortgage didn't ask her refund these extra dollars or extra meat on the mortgage bone can allow you to accomplish a lot of goals so if this ... this is something the teacher interest\nHurry up and call before the market moves it's Saturday the markets froze it's not going to change you you're not pressured you can really just kind of digest the full phone call the number\nEight hundred seven hundred eight zero six said if you want to take an opportunity to save and I'm like our average customer on the mortgage radio program that's five hundred and twenty dollars a month oh you have to do is dial this number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight\nAnd what's your people know about network capital other than that you and I haven't been doing this show for two hundred and one episode\nI mean they're really good so I mean one thing they have us I mean they have taught her mortgage professionals like Travis and Chris Ramsey\nTrading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... 'cause if I go to Salt Lake I use these ... from it rather than the hall and mine around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat the poor is just a state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and there are so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we're completely satisfied with where we are then\nThen great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to cook it created a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal that we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted\nAnd that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we've still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat they classes where you see exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really taken truly a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life that drafter and just a second you can have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always liked to say and I said earlier on the shows doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\n... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have you have bags and bags loads of these these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad is people will get themselves stuck think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right 'cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing haven't had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that\nI said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole another piece of it people go on vacation Ryan right and they get raid the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nWe're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just
