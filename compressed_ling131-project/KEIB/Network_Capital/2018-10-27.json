{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "And sign up for one of our seminars or or visit with one of our advisors or watch videos listen to pod cast read articles all those kinds of things education I think is power\nAnd I want you to learn and we want to be there to be to help you learn that stuff so uh if there's a market crisis coming we want you to be ready okay so money matters dot net is the website money matters\nDot net [noise] All right we're going to take a break and when we come back we're going to talk about how to pass on the fruits of your labor to your greedy washed undeserving airs which is called estate planning so stay tuned this is money matters and I am ... define\nWho runs to the moon\nHave slashing flunk ...\nWho runs the father\nThe country is Andre ... than\nWe are wallowing in champagne this is money matters with Kenmore rape and of course I Am your host Kendall\nRay [noise]\nThank you Jack I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and we're not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states and\nThey found beyond and you know what buses right we want to help more people\nDo their retirement planning than anyone else that is our goal and uh so um because of bad we primarily work with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or who are retiring soon and if that is you then we would love to meet you and work with you\nAnd ... uh recently named the more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors now for the seven year in a row\nAnd without our clients I Would be no aware and so I put that went on them I give it to my clients well this is a part of the show where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor now this week we're actually going to talk about paying for college\nAnd the gift tax laws so if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you give anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year okay [noise] and uh so that's\nIf tax and college in many cases more than fifty thousand dollars a year I Know I have one in college right now and so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak and you play it [noise] I Know I\n\nWould say you\nKnow my saga may be am\nI Am\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite it's designed to take you from riches to rags\nAnd we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education paying for that okay so as I mentioned the gift tax exemption\nA is a Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS [laughter]\nAh almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS\nCame up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon your death then it goes to whoever a man they wanted attacks that so they created the estate tax but the IRS is a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax it all happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to get it all away first and then when they die there's no tax so we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid\nSo they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we are going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that but they also realized that if you tax every single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so we get kind of onerous than they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars per person\nThat you can give to and as a married couple you can give thirty thousand dollars to as many people as you wish to the gift tax\nExempt amount that fifty thousand is you can get that too many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax\nAnd then by the way if you exceed that fifty thousand a gift tax is the same as your state tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay gift taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then have them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have it goes through the child then that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore doesn't count\nSo my advice to you is don't give the child the money now I'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college\nI'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott\nAnd his parents were giving him the money\nTo ostensibly pay for the tuition guess what Scott was doing\nHe wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping the money and he used to come down every day and like he had this Chinese ...\nYou know what this does sat in ... and he'd come down in that and he looked like and slept all night he'd wake up in time to watch the gong show remembers that bury the was that guys they bury something who did the gong show\nHe would wake up and time to watch the show on television and then you know he'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money\nSo if you needed another reason not to get your child the tuition money it's that [laughter] anyway\nAs I mentioned we are a firm that uh we uh we special we specialize in retirement planning that's what we do so we we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon\nAnd so that is you then we want to work with you and so if you go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net is our website\nAnd when you're there

primary residence so let's talk about\nA terms so some people um you know they have no interest in shortening the term of their loan it seems too aggressive and some people are really like the thought of saving you know if you do feel from uh thirty two Fifteen year\nYou're saving sixty five percent off the cost of your house and who should be thinking about going into a shorter term well\nI think a lot of attention I Know like you're never supposed to discriminate on a lot of different things like in this business free so you have to be fair to every different style of life for one thing I pay attention to\nYou know whether it's wrong or right I looked at the age like I really mean it means a lot to me like when do you want to retire like how long do you really believe in your heart that you honestly going to stay in this property those things matter because you want to make it like a made to measure mortgages customs said I like my suits made to measure from the ground up a brown every inch me to make sure it's it's like\nYou know that they always say like you're swimming in your dad sue 'cause it's all big\nYou know I feel like that's just your general mortgage out there it might help you in some aspects of life but it's not\nThe perfect lawn for you so what I Believe in is making it from the ground up around your income your credit your equity your goals what you're looking to do how long you want to be in the home thinking big picture like we ask questions like what's up with like your appliances is there any big cash purchases you know you need to eventually make that\nIt'd be smarter to pull the cash now while you're in the lower rate era compared to where the market's moving we even talk about school like how the age of the kids\nThese things matter now when it comes to the shorter term person I was ... when I bought our property there in West Virginia I was like thirty one years old and I was thinking I don't want to be pain on his thing for the rest of my life so my goal is to do a Fifteen year fix and have it paid off and five so you know everyone has a different idea to me\nAnd like the raid break the rain difference between thirty and Fifteen year and those times was over ... percent and a half\nSo to me I'm like wait a second I could easily sling a slightly higher payment compared to what thirty year and I get the tremor hundred and eighty payments I get to see more noticeable results\nI get to increase my credit scores I'm In control and not letting the banks stretches out and milk me for every dime of interest I like building a security nest egg of equity for a rainy day\nAnd the other day when you get that mortgage bill and you see the principal reduction it's going to put a smile on your face\nYou feel like your money's going to something of value and that value as owning more that portion of your own bath called home equity there's a reason they call it a home owner Tony home or so you know start with a call

reviews aren't enough for you shine always likes to say that that isn't the back of their baseball card so what do people know the stats the numbers who are network capital on how they survived so long in the mortgage game\nWell they've actually expanded well other companies started cutting employees kind of reducing the amount of bankers and one thing about them as they knew eventually we weren't going to be in this low rate era so what they did is they were moving lender fees\nThey reduce their margins they drop their interest rates they beefed up staffing they really put a lot of attention\nInto training around their products and process so that meant a lot to me that shows that you know they're thinking big picture and not just this month so you know that that\nMeant the world to me as someone that's really versed in this business now some of the things you guys need to know is not only is the company itself incredible but they hired a lot of people that funded so many amounts of loans that they were awarded their own individual you know accolades they have a guy named Travis stick\nThe number one v a kid and all of Southern California state law to top one percenters like\nAngelo Costello Christopher go far oh I'm Ian James Ramsey Todd Travis Dick\nYou know a lot of these people have made the top one percent mortgage professionals in the entire country now another thing that I like about 'em as they were one of the number one ranked lenders on consumer affairs dot com\nThey were at the top one hundred mortgage company in mortgage executive magazine one of America's fastest growing company six years running a top thirty financial service company in the nation recently\nNamed as one of the best places to work by the best companies group one of the best mortgage lenders for two thousand at Eighteen per nerd wallet dot com over four thousand five star reviews and they've been in business over Fifteen Years oh another thing that's great is is\nThey're expanding they have an office and Brickell that's in Miami you know it's right when you come over the bridge or a ... right by the capital world there in that amazing office right there\nYou know you guys ... remind me could pull up on your yacht and just walk right and I'm also they have an Irvine office of the mortgage capital of the world all the big players in the mortgage game and a right here in Irvine they're also building in an office there you know somewhere in the Beverly Hills area for LA\nNew York's coming soon you know maybe they're even going to dip into the Pittsburgh Charlotte market you know a lot of great ideas coming out of these people they definitely care about credits they care about wiping out all your dad's\nThey want to improve your credit scores they want to do the best job that can't on your mortgage\nThe clothes so fast like you know you know all that other stuff was cool but the main thing you guys are going to remember about them is they closed bath they get these things done and as low as ten business days that's the fastest that the government will allow them they actually have to run with a parachute because the government set a lot has\nTo take ten business days if there was you know let's see if they could clip his wings and let them fly a little bit they can have\nThese things done same day like it's really that easy like if you fit into their products you know you you are going to push this thing as quickly as possible same day they might call you back and say hey when can you sign all pushing out\nSeven days and that way can funding as little as ten the no lender iffy special is wonderful people loved that but the combination of the low rate the fast turned times the no winner fees that should make you pick up the phone and dial eight hundred\nThis feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love he's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business so the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine\nAnd and he is a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go up to Salt Lake I use these bum a pair of skis from him rather than\nA hall in mine around but it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just a state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and there are so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then\nThen great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal that we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them\nThe first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down this is this something that's going to work for me am I going to be able to do this\nFolks who called the mortgage radio show at that number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight are saving an average of five hundred and twenty eight dollars a month and that isn't nice amount of cash\nBut that is just an average let's take a look at one specific example we do this every week on the show and shot and I think this is our two hundred and third show together he always bringing these fantastic results and I love this because it really helps illustrate what network capital does and how it might look in\nYour life yeah this
