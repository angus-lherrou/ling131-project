years and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas we talk about with our love it and most valued clients\nAnd we not work with over a thousand families in going beyond absolutely\nAnd we work with clients and forty three states\nAnd all the ideas we talk about on the show these are the same ideas we talked about what our beloved and most valued clients as I mentioned Forbes named our financial advisory firm money matters one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states and without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you\nAnd those if you listen to show I Hope you tune in every week at this time because we talk about stuff\nThat if you're over fifty retired or retiring soon is important and uh so we we talk about the estate planning which we're going to do here and just a moment\nBut we also talked about investments we talk about Social Security we talk about income taxes\nAre diversification for one case we talk about the whole ... a whole gamut of stuff right and I hope you benefit from it\n[noise] now this is the part of the show we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and normally we do that but this week we're going to talk about a very deserving and very washed and clean\nAir of yours and that would be your spouse [laughter] there you go and so this week I Want to talk with you about a special kind of trust it's called a Q tip trust like the thing is sticking your ear and a Q tip stands for qualified terminal interest property but do we call it a Q tip for short and is basically a trust that is designed to benefit your\nSpouse so if you're married you have a spouse or we'll have a spouse soon then you want to listen to a gay but before we do that ... can you play it I Know I\n\nWould always say\n\n\nAnd\nOf course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite design to take it from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you\nSo every week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the field of our show this week\nUm has been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters and as I mentioned a little bit ago ... we ... we not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly\nIt's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have an actual security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do so\nWe created in our firm will be called vision one hundred vision one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today [laughter] not only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical and so that's\nKind of a ties in with this segment of the show which is on his state planning and passing on to the next generations and we have a a core value that we live by which is core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserved love you give love always okay\n... if not you don't get love because you think you're going to get it back you give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you\nIf you do that I think you'll live a very happy life because then your happiness is not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that if you're if you're the giver of love then somehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but it comes back\nTo you the more love you put out into the universe the more love will come back to you and you don't have to force it you don't have to expect\nIt it will come to you to our core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us as a burn as a person in our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all the love that we have to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so estate planning which is the topic of this segment is that\nSo let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death you leave the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word trust they don't like that word but you know what\nTrust are are are not black boxes that you put money in cannot come out no in fact just the opposite accused of trust is there for your spouse to be able to have access to the ... for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many and but what it does do is to protect them\nFrom if they get divorced if they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but could happen or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip and the trust for them is is protected from all of that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of a Q tip trust okay so\nThink about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them have for the rest of their lives in the event that you diapers and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you okay something for you to think about so this show we've talked a lot about all of our core values I Hope that uh you got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show\nOur website is money matters dot net money matters dot net and you can podcast didn't

like you so stick around in the morning radio show I'm trees and stress\nThey're back with a mortgage experts John met her ... shirt like us on Facebook followers on Twitter and Instagram for the most up to date financial news and homeowners tips\nAnd speaking of news this from the mortgage reports dot com the south claims nation's fastest growing it still affordable housing markets [laughter]\nYeah I Know this was something new for me I wanted to bring it this week Theresa because we get a lot of phone calls from Dallas and Houston so\nThis article re here's more kind of tailored for them I Want to reward you guys you guys are doing an excellent job of picking up the phones and looking to try to hit the average monthly saving so I Want to give you guys kind of a game plan that are in a blueprint of how we got to this five hundred and twenty dollars a month and savings\nFor the average mortgage radio listener that picked up the phone in doubt eight hundred\nSeven hundred eight zero six eight so we ran the numbers from anyone from January first uh may fifteenth that did he cash out refinance on their primary residence that duty thirty year fix\nThat put all but let's say up to a thousand dollars of the cash out towards eliminating the debt so they definitely fix their credit they definitely got the financial monkey off their back but more importantly they average five hundred and twenty dollars a month and savings\nSix thousand three hundred and thirty six so those numbers right there and make you guys pick up the phone and doubt eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight now back to the mortgage reports\nThey said at land a Dallas and Houston are some of the fastest growing metros in the nation and according to new data they're also some of the most affordable in terms of housing\nNext on the list was Houston the woodland sugar land Texas where the average monthly mortgage payment is a thousand and Fifteen dollars Nineteen point seven percent of the median monthly income\nThe median home price in this area is two hundred and forty four thousand four hundred now Dallas Fort Worth in Arlington another major lone stars the metro ranks third homeowners paying an average of one thousand one hundred and fourteen per month for an median price home of two hundred\nSixty eight thousand two hundred now according to real turn dot coms chief economist Daniel hail\nThe taught free market share a form a few ... commonalities their spacious they don't have many physical barriers\nAnd local governments make development and permitting easier so are you looking to buy and one of these fast growing affordable markets\nTo shop around with network capital and see what mortgage rates you qualify for today it's fast it's easy and it's a great time to make your situation even more affordable so contact our friends or some of the number one\nI'm you know no one in one of the number one mortgage companies in the nation they also have a top one percent mortgage professional that seems to be available anytime that you guys call between Travis Chris Angelo Ramsey in I mean you know no matter where you're from it's well worth the calls so call our friends and now we're Capitol at eight\nHundred seven hundred eight zero six eight eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight\nAnd I just want to mention that one of the things that makes network capitals so exceptional and why they have\nOver four thousand five star reviews is just how efficient they are and how much they care about your time and one of the manifestations of that is that when you call eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight they've chosen not to have a receptionist or someone to take\nAppointments or take your information they don't have that they want it to be patient the person who picks up the phone is a mortgage banker you have questions you want to know if you qualify you want to know if you qualify for a lower rate maybe you're curious what your specific\nMortgage payment would look like if you went down to a ten year Fifteen Years twenty or what would your specific monthly outgo be if you just lower your interest rate going from a thirty year to thirty or the person who answered the phone the person who is standing by right now\nIs a license to veteran experience mortgage banker ready to help you gave you that number once again the average monthly savings for our listeners five\nHundred and twenty eight dollars a month that number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight once again eight hundred\nSeven hundred eight zero six eight and one of the reasons people are so happy with that we're Capitol perhaps as opposed to a bank they're indirect blender so how is that beneficial in terms of speed efficiency and also saving\nThey get to dominate when it comes to like accuracy of the information the turnaround times nobody wants to work with a bank that's going to take sixty Ninety a hundred and twenty days just a complete a simple refinance people want access and the cash now they don't want to make the same weight and to the new year so when you work with a direct lenders notes speed no speed bumps no hurdles\nIs not an uphill battle to get access to the cash I like the fact that they have you know amongst the lowest interest rates in the country amongst the fastest turned times which happens to be as low as ten business days and when you work with somebody that's a direct lender they don't have to charge these garbage junk lender views like processing fees underwriting fees\nThe big one you guys get to skip out on and I'm proud to say is a rejuvenation they used to go straight to the loan officer what's the point of origin nation this competitive market when you're already be in charge the rate that should be enough so if you want to get the best package deal in the business you go direct like a bank cannot compete with the direct lender they're padded interest rates\nThe smaller guidelines they lack of products they don't have a hundred percent of their attention into mortgages and that's why no one's going to go the bank route anymore\nThey're going direct lending the best lenders and the business right now or ... or their direct lenders and I believe in my heart the best package deal is clearly nowhere capital so make contact with them today he'll here's what a lot of people were calling in and say injuries or they want to know if I were to pay a hundred bucks more per month\nYou know when I did and I went with your tenure fix you know how much faster can I paid off if I cashed out a hundred grand\nBut that due to my payment I'm able to pay a hundred dollars more per month how much cash can I get in hand I hate this mortgage insurance how do I get rid of this and these are common questions a lot of people just want to know how am I really in the best possible position I hear my credit card rates are alarming compared to my mortgage rates so a lot of people were getting rid of the credit cards the car notes the personal loans no\nMore student loans people were wiping that debt sleep cleaning it feels good so you know once you guys to test the waters with that if you want to maximize your savings with some of these results you're about to hear how most of these families got the big savings as\nThey went shorter term loans they tied in the dead and they really just kind of went with the lowest rate that they can't even if it meant investing a little bit of costs to go below market on the raid so for you guys that are long term in the home I loved that strategy if you're short term in the home I'd actually like\nGoing maybe with a no cost option look at a thirty year fix ... time in the dead teach you what to do with the month off the mortgage the Oscar refund we're gonna address the home better for resale there's so many different strategy so call in with your ideas\nTell the truth my best advice to you as being a front be real like let's work together let's have a scene in common goal in mind and would fight tooth and nail to get to that finish line so if you like when I'm Talking about down his numbers are standing by eight hundred\nSeven hundred eight zero six said this week we're bringing you guys the tenure fix it still the hot offer it's four point one to five on the rate the AP ours at four point three eight

thousand dollars over the life of the loan but you mentioned they pulled out Fifteen thousand well eighty nine thousand to ... credit card debt and then Fifteen thousand\nCash to have on hand for investment opportunities filled with cash so easy to get right now what are people's spending on\nYeah a lot of people have different ideas I mean we get on the whole show just on what people are spending on but the common ones a lot of people are buying a second home like a lot of people believe rates are going up trees and they found out that wait a second\nI could leverage the home as an investment on my primary tap into better interest rates utilize this house and the equity appreciation and go by that investment home outright not have to take a padded interest rate because of the occupancy a lot of people like a backstop a business against cash flow emergencies a lot of people like to add\nTo protect your existing investments most some of the majority of them are calling to pay off credit card debt that seems to be the most popular a west coast right now they're all about completing home improvement projects that seems to be booming so really the ideas are up to you there are so many things we can talk about\nUm you know you always want to have the cash before you needed as opposed\nTo now you're back into a corner you need the cash\nYou're a little bit desperate you're just going to take whatever is out there so I don't want you guys chasing that costs carried around at that time I think the better method is\nDoing this now like you guys you just spend a ton of money on your credit cards like we're in the holiday season is spending I I can guarantee the majority of you spend the money now I mean you got to Halloween come and you got Thanksgiving before you blink we got Black Friday Cyber Monday Christmas New Years and then it comes Valentine's they spending season is now so\nNow's the time he wanted to leverage the home pay off the debt\nGets a

month throughout the year to kind of prepare for this I'm very organized I Wish a lot of you guys would do the same thing so right now I wouldn't use my month off the mortgage for Christmas it's already funded I Would use that month off the mortgage to\nMe the upgrade some things within my home knock out a little minor improvement project\nDo some landscaping like you know at the house I have an Huntington I just knocked out a bunch of palms and say goes and birds of paradise\nTons of succulent that money could have just been achieved from just a month off the mortgage or just the U.S or refund or you can really do some ... I mean we got a lot of people that we always ask me what did you do with the month off the mortgage so it's always funny to kind of hear what they're doing we get a lot of people to put it in the rams on their car or they go and buy a car for their daughter and her son so\nThere's all kinds of methods to maximize the cash on these deals so you\nKnow there's a lot of meat still left on the mortgage bone I ask what are you going to do with it what are you going to do with the monthly savings\nThink big picture tapping into this market now now is the time compared to the future so this week it is a ten year fix\nThe rates that four point one to five the a P ours at four point three eight still new network capital who's winning the money is not charging no matter what your situations like a processing fee and underwriting the no ... no Adnan let's call them no more junk feeding them we're heading fees\nThat's one of the perks of working with the best they do have all kinds of accolades

rates depend on a great deal on the expectations of investors\nGood economic news tends to be bad for interest rates because an active uh ... raises concerns about inflation now inflation causes fixed income investments like bonds to lose value in that causes their yields let's say another way of seeing interest rates to increase\nOur race or out of the customers control so what I recommend\nIs the listeners should do things that they can control and that's reaching out to network capital for benefits consultation they have a plethora of programs that should've system wide range of customers Theresa I loved the network Capitol people or benefit hunters always like to use that term because it's not always about the rate is about what the loan is doing for you\nThis company is definitely a
