cashed out and paid off fifty five thousand dollars of the credit cards\nWe cashed on and paid off the Ninety five and ... thousand dollars that was remaining on a rental property we also cash out about ten thousand dollars for home improvements\nThey really like the shorter term on because of the lower interest rate the actually invested a little bit of money to buy down the injury because they believe the market was going to go up and guess what\nHe was a hundred percent right as the market moves that Joe gets leader and sweeter and now he doesn't have a credit card debt he hasn't paid
