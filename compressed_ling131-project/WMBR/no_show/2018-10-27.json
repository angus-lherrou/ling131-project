really interesting story a it's a song I Believe the also played last season two on her all the all grown up so it's a\nIt's called an id is from their first album or you've probably heard it before but on what's interesting is there's been a lot of speculation about what that\nLike a rumor that very quickly spread and like it seems reasonable because like you know it's an ominous edgy name and it kind of see well what's the meaning behind that people are\nYeah so there's a lot of speculation and so eventually I either butler wrote the lyrics song addressed it\nAnd he said that the song was actually named after drummer billboards beard because it was point B and it looked like in ... and he couldn't think of a name for the song so he literally just name the song needed after billboards beard\nAnd he thought okay this is like pretty lame I might spice it up a little bit by adding like punctuation after each thing so then it became an acronym and I'd be and\nSomeone who I was releasing it in America started spraying the rumor that was made to the environment he actually had nothing to do that and it's literally the stupidest possible\nWay that you could imagine that they got to me so I there you go ah so we're going to play that I'm next for you as well as a little bit of metallic out right after so enjoy\nYou know [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]

here it's good you just heard medieval babes midday evil they have it has the H e\nThat stuck together in the name and this has right hand it to me in the library so I was very excited to play this usually it makes its appearance earlier in the week on mistress Laura's show back in the ... free so I'm Glad to bring it down on the program for there to the week this was the album Victoria ...\nAnd this was in the bleak mid winter the text by poet to Christina ...\nSo we have a lot more music one thing I found in the library tonight there's a theme I really liked the record library\nGiant surprised everyone I Know there is a new album won't new to us it's it's neutral everyone this isn't a voter records one of my favorite labels I'm beginning to discover Elizabeth America oh and this seems to be a retrospective of a lot of her work\nWith some new things thrown in and she has arranged some I'm Emily Dickinson poems and this tickled my brain because I remember that she that later also has\nA compilation of the of similar poems that were commission back in two thousand ten for the marsh chapel acquire across the river\nAt Boston University so I wanted to play some of the same texts and compare and contrast so I'm going to start that off with the tax for\nThe poem these are all like really nice pastoral poems that I really like and so\nThe world whereas only know does cricket spider be is what she calls her collection and it's a bit more pastoral\nSo this is the poem us either sewed at night and I think this is Fifteen considering ah we have to ... the full moon a couple of days ago\nA spider's showed at night without a light upon an arc of white\nIf rough it was of games or shroud of known himself himself inform the mortality his strategy was physiology me [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nTo\nThe movies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah yeah\n\nA man\n\nGo\n\n\nFor a long\nTime\nYou\n\n\nKnow [noise]\n\n\n\nSo that conclude to our Emily Dickinson segment of the show that kind of an array spontaneous\nSouth of music from Emily Dickinson poems one was from the Elizabeth VR VR co album butterfly effect then we also had a very no the album from\nElena roar and then we also had an interpretation\nBy Ricky in Gordon and the vocalists there were a Middle Eastern field done an amended passenger\nSo the texts we looked at were spiders soda at night and then I really love the poem be I'm expecting you\nBecause it's it's so reminiscent of spraying and now that October is almost over I think it's really important to sit and ... remember\nThe little beautiful past or all things so I wanted to bring that one back and I remember seeing that tax and seeing it on another album so I dug it out and so we that was from the both\nElizabeth America and from Ricky in garden so those were two interpretations there and then this is my letter to the world a that was butterfly effects and that was also she is so that was the get Elizabeth and Ricky on those so I really really like\nI really enjoyed that I think it was like a really interesting experiment to see which interpretations I liked better and how different composers use the texture of insurance and voices to make\nThese poems into something new and they're really lovely little poems that have their own melodic\nQuality I was asking someone I don't remember who it was about ... why people like to such a leader can since ... music and it really is because they have their own\nI was asking my friend who's a composer because we wrote deliberate out together and we're writing a little oratory oh opera things together\nAnd um I did the libretto and he's composing and so you'll hear more about that maybe several months from now but when\nWe were talking through some of the arranging I asked him so what makes a good taxed for arranging too and we talked a little bit about Emily Dickinson poem and why they're super convenient\nSo that was an adventure which I enjoyed I had another adventure this week which was a ton of fun\nI discovered that there is a really wonderful\nVocal on not vocal\nExcuse me so I think some of you remember this summer there were some really great shows on the air and one of the DJ's Emily is now taking a class that she invited me to\nAnd I got to meet this really wonderful flutes player and uh\nIs what's her name ... yes a much clearer chase this week because she was giving a concert over at Harvard\nShe is a closer and also a professor and it was really wonderful experimental flute music and really contemporary use a lot of recording looping amplification there was also multimedia or multi instruments\nMore playful composition she was featuring a lot of new work and work composed for her by composers that actually happened to be there at the concert and so one of the pieces I really liked was a to music boxes that were cranked by two performers\nOf the music boxes where amplified and so the tape ran between them and so Claire during the performance a twisted the tape and twisted the paper tape and a taped together so that created a Mobius strips of like an infinite surface that could be wound between\nThe two music boxes and so then she took a hole punch and she started hole punching and so you heard the hole punching you've heard the cranky you heard the wrestling of the paper\nAnd then you start to hear the tone is coming from the music boxes as the\nUm\nAs the piece was produced and so it was just really interesting\nPiece and I really enjoyed and that was composed by Phyllis chatting and she happened to be there so that was really cool and so I just got this really wonderful appreciation for this type of music and she is an incredible flute player and ... ah the\nProgram one of the pieces she was performing was also composed and ah was dedicated ... who I really admire wonderful composer wonderful\n[noise]\n... you have a DVD and people who\n[noise] it's\n\n\n\n\n\nNice [noise]\n\n\n\nYeah yeah [laughter] yeah\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nRight right right right well thanks I mean\nAll that I mean it's not really sure how\nI feel like I'm not too\nLong [laughter]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nOh\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nOoh\n\n\n[noise]\n\nThey give her up stars from the album of radio ads and reflection this piece commissioned by notice the collegiate local ensemble for competition by spend David censor him with ... by Amy low\nAnd before that we had those two songs by the crossing and international contemporary ensemble\nWhich Claire chase is part of the board of directors for believe um I think she found it also which is cool uh so the second time that was part of the Carolina shy\nCycle to their hands and this was listening to the displaced and the number is repeated throughout San where from the international displacement monitoring center the number of total people in the world displaced for various reasons so\nIt was and then uh the last piece we will play tonight will be\nFrom a new album by Kate sober uh it said ... and this has performed with the wedding ensemble and these are fairly lengthy pieces so I'll just play an excerpt from a poet chicks with text from Aristotle and ... is a bridge by Kate super [noise]\nSo we have a lot to look forward to going to be an exciting quarter the hour before babes the radio experience\n\nSo from two weeks ago as a reminder you what we have been reading\nThe moon rose higher overhead and he'll walk cold stiff and bruised he sat up the battle had long since ended and he was a loan\nOut of the corner of his eyes he some movement and turned to see what it was a Fox white and the moonlight had run to the top of Iraq I Know it was looking at him curiously the captain rose with difficulty the Fox remained where it was a moment longer\nThan during all the way through the rock and wild brush the captain looked around the walls of the ... and we're high too steep to climb he touched a dusty had his face it was bloody but he was surprisingly an hurt\nHe did not want to cry out in case the enemy soldiers still up on the road the Fox reappeared and looked at him intently what could have possibly want did it seem as prey or it's under the moon glued to the size and the soldier was struck with a sense of knowing end up being known\nThe fuck started away a second time and now the men staggered after it hoping it would lead him to a stream or that he would find a place along the way where he could climb a back up the road and find his way back to the sort of do but the further he wants the Wilder became until the way it was nearly impasse\nSo he saw their Fox's eyes ... on them looking at him from beneath Iraq the Fox still men for him to follow he thought but he could not possibly fit he looked up again at the pinprick stars high above the steep sides of the ravine he had no choice but to try\nPiece by piece he shut his armor and stoop down toward the Fox was an slid head first into the gap\nThe inside was dry and dark and warm the heat from the day's son still held deep in Iraq he pulled himself forward following the light pad of the Fox is paws his breath was the only other sound ragged and heavy\nThe gap grew wider and lighter until he was able to pull himself to his speech on one hand trailing the rough rock walk ahead\nSuddenly he found himself out again and the cool air under the lights of the moon which now felt much larger and much closer than I had when he had entered the caves\nBefore him was averted to waste is terraces poring over it with flowers and vines the spokes of desert palm spending overhead he heard running water and I missed rose from below it was ... he had never seen in all his patrols the mountainous region he had come from\nThe Fox again caught his eye running down the first terrorist and out of sight and that's when he first heard the first phrase of song sung by human voices high and clear and in a language he didn't recognize his speech carried him forward following the sound down into the terrorists says\nHe came to a temple was high columnist raped and fabrics and open to the air\nA crowd of people gather their their voices joined in song there was something familiar about their look they're closing the style in which they wore their hair he stood at the edge of the crowd until he was\nRealized where he had seeing these people before this was the face of the enemy\nThe song stopped and the trouble is silent the faces of the enemy we're now altered towards him he knew he should be afraid an armed un alone as he was\nA low murmur rose among them but he could not understand too stressed and armor came forward and he did not resist them when they took him by the arms and brought him into the center of the temple area he looked around\nAt the painted in ... at the library hanging spread between the columns he realized for all his travels he had never once crossed until the end of the enemy the war had always been one of defense of survival long vigils and intense idols now he was here where the Fox I let him\nBeautiful work of art that is so comprise the parts [noise] my\nSo small

I co and before that was guilty moon by Ryan Ross and Helene Erin from the moon hunter soundtrack\nSo that last on that just was played was from Phoenix right ace attorneys specifically the third game it's the theme song of my second favorite character from the whole trilogy so far he's very funny and his whole thing is that he drinks coffee\nUh that's that's his whole gimmick also he has\nA weird I visor saying oh I don't use this to see\nBecause otherwise you can't it's like Star Trek or ingesting [laughter] a guilty moon was from moon hunters which is a really really neat game it's a rogue like and\nYou finish it in about two hours except that's not actually the ending because there's so much to do in the game and you're supposed to get a bunch of different endings to find the real ending I'm not entirely sure I have found the real ending yet I don't know if they're actually is\nA real ending like a cannon ending like the one that's supposed to be right I haven't figured that out yet but I've played it a lot of times at this point it's very fun it's got excellent music\nIt\nSome reason that had I told you about super hot I feel like as definitely mentioned it before it was mainly uh delo is here it's like there's this video game that's like a fish\nIt even field is shooter game that's like a lot like call of duty like to think about think of call of duty except there's somebody made it in unity ... edition\nI'm so that's about the quality of game ploy all the guys are like little blocks so the version over even field I'm Talking about is like the the free version to like the first version um\nSo it's like impossible like there's a very poor gay mechanics the guy who made in that didn't balance things so you just like manually move slide who used to change the game from easy to Harvard or whatever and it's like a pretty great grandparents were just trying to make it into like an actual game so now there is like\nA now you can actually fly the planes without crashing and media [laughter] you know they like\nActual game playing the characters explode into chunks in that one yeah like blue chunk there's a lot of like yeah there is also a lot of like lectures revolving around like being killed in vehicles I'm so occasionally there's just like vehicles that fly two hundred feet in the air\nAnd stuff like they just like your like very entertaining physics related\nLike hey Larry from the ... the the video game on talking about is called super hot and it's a first person shooter but ... says you know how like in um\n[noise] uh in like normal efficiency to games I like you like mostly just sit there and hide behind something and then you get killed like every so often and then like occasionally you like have this really cool like spin around and move\nTo like get two people at once or something and everybody's like well persistent footage on you today 'cause it's like never happens\nUm so the premise you yeah and that is like that's like all the shots so it didn't seem like super slow motion so you have time it's like oh it's more like playing chess\nTo do I say you can like like it to like James Bond interesting like it's just bullet time all the time a ... oh yeah yeah pretty much a [laughter] that's pretty fun\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nMaybe that's too naive or maybe I could walk by\nWay more than a month maybe we would like\nCan and it'd be hard to believe\nBut maybe we would both last\nGoing to ask that she was the one thing which do you think about the times used to be on it maybe I could ask why\nOr maybe I Would simply the baby with a guy\nThat maybe I should just leave or maybe because I'm\nCause the world and just breeze make corners of his mind and whatever that I bring until it's just me and her we would form among the escalator down\nWith no ... I mean we could do this number maybe shattered their job that we could arise land in April I wake up back in our room and she'd be their mouth or right before she was going to\nA new one out there on ... where am I wrong if I get\nBack a maybe a couple of you are and\nMaybe a little a\nHead or a a ... a ... ah\nWhat they're now and maybe a ... or\nMaybe just is\nOf hand so badly and\nThe bag was drinking this will be jumping Jews may ... will go grab at me and most of them bumping him ... little dinner party going on strike that is going to be angry I enjoy\nThe bad thing though is now or on your way back nobody but but you know trying to say well why do you still have no idea what the what we thought\nThat was the banks are caught a little bit more about it and they do care at West Virginia that an hour in the act like you\nKnow the lead blogger for the driver loan\n... jobs are\nNow going to die from each other if you'd like the little one of you to be louder than we found them to come out and rent a little blanket mentally each other but I think I've got the courage to monster maybe\nBut maybe a little louder so\nI'm Wondering about the time to be\nWhile out or maybe I Would say on\nOr maybe I could stop sign of course the world that just freeze may or a road or whatever that I Breathe so let's just me and her\n[noise] um [noise] ...\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nYou [noise]\n[noise]\nYou know [noise]\nAnd\n...
