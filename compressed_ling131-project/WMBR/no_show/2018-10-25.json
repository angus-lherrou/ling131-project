[laughter] and I'm going to write a book wouldn't that [laughter] um it's never that by the way you write and may maybe about ... eventually\nBut um I think\nYeah this is one of the first time that I've kinda gotten into not just\nResearch of this you know this physical research nature but\nI'm also trying to use narrative and an audio\nBeyond just something to be transcribed and you know free I imagined in some paraphrase that I you know then I Would then writing a book to say you know instead of saying\nI spoke with Lawrence and you know he told me about this beautiful red house you know research a lot of people would just say there is a beautiful house and then just maybe credit you at the end you may be only maybe in the case scenario\nYou'd be a footnote I'm so right like is ... I'm a I Would hope to I'm hoping to try and like pull pull those voices out a finance\nAnd think about how do you use those as like your primary sources in the same way that you would use academic research and you know archival research and\nI'm maps and these other forums that we've\nWell to answer your question I I definitely ended up asking\nAbout twenty times more questions are starting to think about twenty times more questions when I went in with right and you always go in thinking\nMy question is perfect and people are going to give me perfect and then there's I on and then you know the beautiful product I have thought about will be imagined that are paying emerged everything is cut and dry and obviously that's how it happens nope\nUm it was great 'cause there was also just I think also got the people that I was talking to thinking about it um they hope in a way that I continue to talk to them that they will say oh yeah I I kinda thought about what you said and you know a product is for me\nAs even more of a springboard so this is just the tip of the iceberg I Will say for what I Want to do with is moving forward it may not continue with your own specifically but\nThat definitely this type of work will continue\nNice yeah well I guess it's probably a little bitter sweet or like didn't come to the full\nYou know go on a gift happy ending but it sounds like the really important stuff that's going to come in the future so the great ones hope yeah [laughter] right [laughter] I guess [laughter] um\nI just wanted to say that I really like the way that you sort of frame like pulling people out of the footnotes mhm um I don't know if I've ever heard that before but I think that's a really powerful frame\nIf you haven't heard it I Need to write it down I was going to copyright it immediately it's a long way out to eating is a little bit earlier reference [laughter] have like Morgan ... yeah um [noise]\nYou had just wonderful I got all the rest of your last one\nThey [laughter]\nUh okay I have to find a little questions for you okay I'm stuck in the last question is are there any like\nResources OR Books or ideas that you would suggest listeners ... read if they want to like\nYou know understand how you got to where you are and you're thinking you're project where like things you think everybody should just read anyways because it's really good and can be by researcher New Orleans or whatever mhm um do you ask for a second question is like in the last question just how can people find you or your work okay in the world\nUm so sources good sources um so we actually talked about this or you mentioned this author a little while ago I'm Gloria and so I'll do that and I was\nRevisiting her anthology the bridge call my back um the ... version I have the forward as by\nTony Tony came to borrow who's also a great storyteller and short story a novelist\nAnd and Barbara Smith\nUm who is Boston who's very Boston that I mean the whole book is kind of like ... has a very interesting besides Barbara Smith has a very interesting like Boston\nUndertone unilateral ... to it so but yeah servicemen was or still is at Emerson is oh wait I don't know if ... percent but definitely still around still is a guy was at Emerson when this was happening\nUm but that's a great anthology about just women of color and a lot of clear women of color just talking and I think that kids are really awesome example of um how the ...\nAnd you know um [noise] how do I how do how do you say like collective manifesto [laughter] um\nSo I think that was really inspiring to like something else reference that for me and bring that back and just kind of even though I was reading a cover to cover\nJust flipping through that um was inspiration I'm\nI'm sure there are other all the pod cast out on the world you're always\nEven if I don't like fully agree with what's going on or it's just to be in the audio world and wanting to create audio it was really helpful\nUm and just hearing the way people are doing things and the way that they chopped up something and um has just gave me inspiration to figure out okay how can this where ...\n... yeah um yeah if you're going to be worked fine\nTo me and my work so if you're I'm probably the most immediate\nExample of audio things have been doing is if you want to go listen to the show have been working on this summer the reader show which is what's a beastie and you can find that on what's at ... dot com is the full show archive so someone more recent ones you will\nSee me here me well yeah

central ...\nAnd they do call me that because I like to\nDo well on things\nDon't what I say look we are totally focused on November ...\nWe are [noise] organization that I found it next year in America is the largest grassroots organization in the United states specifically focused on people under the age of thirty five in terms of engagement and turn out\nWe believe that what happens this year in the midterms will be dispositive for what happens afterwards and we don't believe we can afford to lose\nSo everything that we're doing we are all in on November ... and we have absolutely no idea what's going to happen\n[noise] yes uh there is an election as a result of who when there is an election coming up a couple of weeks and\nUh I I think it's a very important election I think that um whether or not Congress\nA an an effect a um structural effect in Washington DC but will also\nSay something about the American public and we'll also I think give people hope since ah since the presidential election of two thousand and sixteen I think a lot of people felt despondent and have lost a bit of hope\nAnd there's a lot riding on this election coming up uh uh for the first Tuesday in November now among the things we're going to explore tonight on sound and fury\n[noise] uh is whether or not elections we can depend whether or not we can depend on elections\nI have been saying publicly for a long time that I think voting is very important but it's only one tool in our in our democracy tool box\nA but it's hard to be I find it difficult to be confident in elections because um there is a more than enough evidence to prove that elections\nAre are um\nI ... that the results of elections have been stolen it let me put it this way elections have been stolen than the results have not a\nHave not been democratic because of a actors in ... in many states in the United states\nWho control the ballot box these actors are Ninety nine point nine percent so it's a effectively all members\nYou search that that I that I couldn't site to back up\nUm that statement that Republicans steal elections and then what they do is they turn around\nAnd they project they're wrong doing on Democrats so what did what did a Trump and his followers his disciples say during the campaign and during you know during the election period and afterwards they kept\nTrying to ... they kept saying that there was all this election fraud um illegal aliens were voting a and and\nTrump actually explicitly said that he would only accept the outcome of the election if he want if if Clinton\nIf Hillary Clinton had won the election of two thousand is sixteen Trump explicitly said he would not accept that\n\nBy eroding confidence in elections through the lives that they were telling the two million illegal aliens had gone up to New Hampshire devote\nWe were distracted from what was really going on which is that Republicans secretaries of state and secretary of state in close to thirty states\nHad stolen the election by removing names registered the names of registered voters\nThat had been compiled a list called interstate cross check\n[noise] I don't I don't want to get into the uh the the ... the bones of this thing uh right now uh if\n... dot com and we'll have a little bit more to say about his work in Georgia he is suing the I Believe he's suing the secretary state\nOr in Georgia or or to find out\nWhich names in Georgia they have removed they have a illegally removed from the voting rolls the big thing about it in ... across check was that\nA a a ... a a close to thirty states more than half the states supplied the names of their registered voters\nAnd the idea was to cross check to check to make sure that uh people weren't voting and multiple states but what would they but the but but that's that's absurd and ridiculous because there's no evidence that that kind of fraud\nExists in the United states has really ever existed in the United states but they were actually doing was they were taking particular names like the name Lee\nAnd saying well there's all these people named Lee we're going to cross them all off because it it because maybe the the same person and their voting multiple times\nAre and what you wind up doing is you wind up scrubbing\nAnd suppressing scrubbing names off these lists or as some people show up to the polls and they can't vote\nWhere they're given a they're ... they're given a provisional ballot which never gets counted and Republicans wind up winning elections because primarily the people's names they scrub off the ... the voting rolls\nI'm gonna keep\nOne one eye on the CD player and a one high on the ball game again the red Sox are now a head three to two and a credit score to a lot more bit of a squander that had the bases loaded and we're only able to score one run on a on a walk\n[noise] but uh but well\nThink the team's gonna continue to be relentless and we are going to continue to be relentless

...\nFought with a drug addiction for many years but what a what a what a creative mind of course Bryan Anderson on a keyboards\nHe was a regular a collaborator with gills Scott heroin or especially in these early seventies records this one's from Nineteen Seventy four winter in America\nOr possibly Mm Mm [noise] possibly in not his most well known or a record um of course I'm the revolution will not be televised probably his most well known track\n'em but this was winter in America from Nineteen Seventy four we heard peace go with you my brother kills Scott heroin and Brian Jackson both myself and a mark stern of Sunday mornings radio with a view had a chance to actually meet kill Scott heron many years ago\nOn must have been around eighty three I met him around eighty to eighty three when I was I'm an undergraduate\nIn college and um\nHe was he was a he was a difficult a challenging person to have a conversation with a I don't think he suffered fools very very much and back then I was a bit foolish what can I say\n\nWe also heard some Isaac Hayes a single I stand accused from Nineteen Seventy\nAnd\nWillie Nelson a pretty brand new album a it's an album of covers it's called my way and we\nMy way [noise] started everything off tonight with slightly stupid and uh that track featured yellow man on vocals living in Babylon was the name of the song and everyday life everyday people in name of the\nCD\nSpeaking of everyday life everyday people we uh we will ... us us everyday folk will have an election coming up in a in a few weeks\nAnd among ... among the things will be deciding here in Massachusetts says the office of a governor we have a three\nWhat I consider important a ballot referendum questions to consider\nA locally or here in ... uh Suffolk County well Boston's in Suffolk County Cambridge is in Middlesex but in Suffolk County which includes Boston or they will be among other things voting for a district attorney\n\nA a number of uh a number of other races but I'm can we trust our election system I'd like to think\nA is our is our election system immune from uh from trickery and manipulation\nI'd like to think that here in Cambridge in Boston where mostly\nUh were mostly secure the Republican Party isn't all that strong here in Massachusetts we have a Democrat secretary of state however in ... in states around the country with Republicans in charge of the elections division that's not the case\nElections are are under threat\nAnd so as to [noise] ah either prevent or discouraged likely Democrat democratic of likely voters who would likely vote for Democrats as opposed to Republicans\nGreg sergeant has written a book he um he's a columnist with the Washington Post he writes the plum line blog at the Washington Post he's all he has also in the past written for New York magazine the New York observer and talking points memo\nThe name of the book is called an an civil war taking back our democracy and an age of Trump being disinformation and thunder dome politics and yes he's referring to the thunder dome which was a gigantic cage featured in the third\nOf the Mad Max movies where a\nCombatants fought to the death to decide everything essentially right and wrong and a government policy and they just flooded out in blood and blood battles in the in this giant or this giant cage called the thunder dome\nAnd so he's referencing that to sort of describe what are uncivil politics or like today let me read a little bit from the from the jacket of the book\nAmerican democracy is facing a crisis as fraught as we've seen in decades Donald Trump's presidency has raised the specter of or thought Terry and rule extreme polarization and the scorched earth war between the parties drags on with no end in sight\nAt the heart of this dangerous moment is a paradox it took a figure as uniquely menacing as Trump to rebut the nation's attention on the fragility of our democracy yet the causes of our dysfunction are long running they predate Trump\nIn an civil war Greg sergeant sounds an urgent alarmed about the deeper roots of our democratic backsliding and how we can begin to turn things around\n[noise] I I found the book interesting but a bit timid\nAnd a bit of a big middle of the road dish I ask him a towards the end of our conversation which will hear in a moment I Do ask him why he didn't take a while he didn't take a stronger stand\nUm uh when it comes to the the um machinations of the Republican Party but\nUltimately\nSays he is somewhat optimistic and believes that are instituting something called\nAutomatic voter registration could help our democracy and he talks about that ... about that in the book Massachusetts is getting automatic voter registration in twenty twenty the governor signed a bill or earlier this year this is a situation where\nInstead of having to opt in to register to vote as we do now you have to opt out so if you had any ah ah if you had any um business with the department of motor vehicles if you're a driver and you have to renew your license that sort of thing where you have ... you have any dealings with other state agencies such as mass health\nOr where a quite a few people get their get their health insurance who can't afford private insurance\nWhen you do business with them or you know a a arranged for benefits or get your license renewed you're automatically registered to vote and that's called automatic voter registration Massachusetts in twenty twenty will become the at this point would become the fourteenth state\nTo have this sort of opt out situation rather than rather than having to opt in anyway\nThe Washington Post his new book is called and on civil war we will start\nWith a\nUh my first question to Greg as I uh as I set up the interview\nAnd just have to push a few buttons here and make sure everything is set up correctly I Believe it is and\n\n\nThe year two thousand seemed to mark a turning point we we know a lot more now than we did back then about some of the machinations that went on um a ... in the in the presidential election especially a\nThose are extremely serious matters but you're absolutely right there's more going on and and I what I what I Hope this book does is not function I don't intend to to function as\nAn exhaustive look at all all of our problems I I Want to I wanted to sort of create a framework within which people could understand these things and potentially pursue them um inform themselves about them further so I Would strongly urge your listeners to\nCheck out websites like the Brennan Center for justice is website which documents in amazing detail all this all this stuff\nIncluding the problem is you're talking about and there are journalists out there like Greg palace than and Ari Berman than of Mother Jones who are documenting this stuff in a day to day away and you're absolutely right we need to focus on all of it\n[noise] ah ... ... one more quick question if we could squeeze in um I read recently had the pleasure of meeting one of your colleagues at the Washington Post a EJ Dionne\nWho's a ... a visiting professor at Harvard up here in Cambridge and a couple of things he talks about I like to see what you what you think are a huge eight talks a little bit about compulsory voting like they have in Australia\nThe increasing participation is ranked choice voting where you get to choose or your first choice your second choice and candidates benefit from you know if they don't have enough one number one choices they benefit from number two choices what do you think of those proposals\nI I didn't I don't endorse mandatory voting although I I really fully understand the goal of the proposal would I talk a lot about is automatic voter registration which I think as it was a reform with tremendous promise\nIt it what automatic voter registration does and we're seeing in numerous states at this point it's spreading what's surprising speed is it registers you automatically if you come in contact with a state agency like the department of motor vehicles\nAnd you can opt out but what it does is it it registers you without doing anything and so that removes the registration process and it's kind of a weapon of disenfranchisement and and brings more voters and to the process\nUm ranked choice voting is a really interesting idea of a group called fair vote dot org and I'd suggest your listeners look at that website to\nOr has been pushing for a long time and has a great explainer on how it all works the gist of it to be really overly simplistic as to say is that it it allows for more representation a it allows for better representation of all the voters in a particular district\nBy doing away with the winner take all I'm districts and instead placing putting in place ranked voting in which you choose your first second and then say third choice and a district ends up getting I'm represented by numerous um\nBy numerous representatives and so what ends up happening is the voters who are in a minority in the district have representation and that would\nTrip and so forth so so I I think that that's something\nObviously these things are lower ranked choice voting in particular is a long way off it's it's very hard to imagine that happening anytime soon but what I argue in the book is that it's a positive for us to be debating these things even if they're if they seem farfetched because\nEven that sort of gets us all thinking about the problems in our political system and what might be done about them\n... and Massachusetts earlier this year passed a automatic voter registration I think right now the ... fourteen Oh yes to a yeah Republican governor is either right or a governor Baker and he's apparently the most popular governor in the country even ... even amongst well Democrats [laughter]\nWell I'll tell you you're seeing a you're seeing some Republican support for this innovation and there's really no reason why automatic voter registration should be partisan if it's the Republicans should be able to benefit from making it easier for their voters to vote\nA Greg sergeant I see our our time is that thank you so much\nThank you\nGreg sergeant again a author of the Washington Post a plum line column\nAnd the new book in on civil war taking back our democracy in an age of Trump being disinformation and thunder dome politics the book is on the custom house imprint\nAnd you're listening to sound and fury on WNPR Cambridge that's eighty eight point one on your FM dial WNPR dot org on your\nLaptop computer or digital handheld device I'm Dave good man the central ... they call me that because I like to dwell on things and right now I'm dwelling on the fact that the red Sox are ahead forwarded to\nI misspoke earlier and said a three to ...\nAll the uh one of our starting one of the red Sox starting pitchers is now a pitching in the eighth inning as what are the manager Alex Cora calls the rover position they starting pitcher who comes into pitch one inning to bridge between the regular relief corps\nAnd the uh closer uh Craig or a ... a ... a kimbrell\nSo for the two Red Sox are are in the lead in the top of the eighth inning uh and it's one out and Nathan evolved he is throwing strikes at a hundred miles per hour [noise]\nOkay uh coming up a leader in the hour we'll hear from backyard Cambridge and I'm Talking about global climate change and how it affects the good people the good folk of Cambridge\nA global climate change how it affects the good focus Cambridge and I'm also a here's some more music here's something brand new from a poll sacks he is from New York City he has a lived his entire life in a New York city is lower east side\nAnd this is his six\nAlbum [noise]\nIt's called full Detroit and the song well here is leaving little heaven behind [noise]\nWhen I'm Bree some looser with\nMe [noise]\n... miles per

more about it in a moment but we also\nHave joy in our lives and the red Sox are now one hour away from winning game two of the two thousand and Eighteen World Series Boston's up for the two Craig kimbrell is on the mound in the top of the ninth and there are two outs so the next time you hear my voice\nUh I don't want to give Ken a horror but probably the next time you hear my voice or the red Sox will be up to nothing in this World Series I Hope I didn't just just jinx the team\nWe're going to hear now a program produced here in Cambridge called backyard Cambridge this this season their season two episodes for\nHas to do with the global climate change and the effect that that a worldwide issue will have on the good folks the good folk here in Cambridge so I Hope you'll love give this a I Hope you'll listen to this\nAnd um I Hope it's informative for you\nAnd I'm I'm just dragging things out a bit a cause I really do want to know whether or not kimbrell can close this game at how\nUm [noise] as I said again the red Sox are up for it to its two outs and it does that count as one and one\nTwo strikes away didn't do do you you know I really I don't I don't want to um\n[noise] I don't want to start anything until I Know for sure the red Sox have one and we can all well don't go to bed yet I was gonna say then we can all go to bed happy don't go to bed yet anyway what I was going to ... when I was saying before that we must have joy in our lives and for me that joy includes the local baseball team\nCraig kimbro gets to save and David Price gets the when he is now what a two and one\nIn yes he is now too and one in uh the playoffs in two thousand in Eighteen talk about a redemption story\nDavid Price but now we must now the game is over with one and we're headed to LA [noise] uh now we move on to a ... very important issues are in our in our local area and on and on our planet\nBack yard Cambridge again this was originally released as a podcast in April of this year\nBefore we start a quick point in front of us here at back at Cambridge we want to better understand who's listening to this podcast so that we can create the best and most useful content possible for you\nSo if you're listening to it as we want your help with something incredibly important and incredibly easy for you to do our listeners survey\nIt takes less than two minutes and you can find it a backyard Cambridge dot com slash survey that's too much of your time at ... dot com slash survey you can also find a link and ... now let's kick off this would show\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYeah in fact to find a changing dangerous and it is already being felt in the United states that is according to a new government report\nObtained by the way the effects of climate change are being saying on Australia's great Barrier Reef an aerial survey shows two thirds of the race has been damaged by coral bleaching we're talking\nWith us today that twenty Seventeen was the second hottest year on record since modern measurements began in Eighteen eighty the agency's findings continue a decades long trend of global warming fulfill\nMy solemn duty to protect America and its\nClimate accord [noise]\nLast June ... Trump announced that the U.S will back out of the Paris climate agreement a groundbreaking world accord that includes nearly every country on the planet what could be so important that it requires the attention of every country and that everyone has agreed is so pressing climate change\nWhen we think of climate change we tend to think of it on that global scale it seems like such a big problem one that we as individuals have little control over\nThat makes it easy to feel helpless especially in a time when the federal government announces decisions that style progress\nClimate change is of course global but the effects are local and in many cases those local effects can be devastating just look at the tragedy that was Hurricane Harvey what's more local than three feet of storm surge flooding your living room\nIt's common for people to think the preparing for climate change is out of our hands\nToday we want to challenge of that idea in fact we can to bridging are lucky enough to live in a city that's actually paving the way for what climate change progress an activism can look like on the local level will start by looking at the effects of climate change focusing on one most imminently threatened to the city of Cambridge\nThen we'll tell you what Cambridge is doing about it both in the city and various community groups finally we'll talk\nAbout how you just one person or one household can make an impact I ... in Cambridge this is your backyard\n[noise]\nOur very first episode of backyard Cambridge started with Tip O'Neill the legendary former speaker of the house of representatives who's from right here in Cambridge Tip O'Neill coined the phrase all politics is local\nToday I'm back here Cambridge with the inspiration of Tip O'Neill where explaining why even climate change is local we'll start with the part of an issue that's most intuitively local the effects of climate\nAnd it's to Cambridge of increasing temperatures increasing precipitation more extreme climate events like Superstorm Sandy and of course the level rise\nThat's John ... the city's environmental planner speaking at a climate change round table describing what we expect to happen in Cambridge he says climate it's not just an environmental problem\nBut one but also imposes risks to Cambridge is economy to our quality of life to public health and safety\nAnd besides more extreme of a ... which you know people tend to focus on those we also expect to see changes in our average Bailey climate that's going to shift as well\nWe'll get more into what the city is doing about climate change later but one of the steps of city has taken is it commissioned a climate change vulnerability assessment part two of which was released last February\nIt was conducted by a team of city officials consultants and climate experts to establish a technical foundation for a city wide plan to prepare for it and respond to climate change\nThis has been established that the two most pressing concerns for Cambridge extreme heat and flooding if we don't adequately prepare for these effects the consequences will be far reaching take the economy for example\nNow it's hard to be precise when predicting how much environments disaster could cost the city\nBut part one of the vulnerability assessment from twenty Fifteen found that if a city wide disaster like substantial flooding or a power outage resulting from extreme heat or to happen today it could cost forty three million dollars a day and lost productivity and impact almost every job in the city\nThe national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that he was the largest weather related cause of death in the U.S since it started collecting data in Nineteen eighty eight by the year twenty thirty Cambridge could face nearly triple the number of days above Ninety degrees Fahrenheit that's thirty one days a year from\nOf Cambridge was not their emissions\nYou know you get a much more of a ripple effect and more and more cities reducing emissions from what we need to alternately solve the problem then that's your action plan is one of the city has taken toward mitigation and of course there are others\nBut despite our efforts towards mitigation we still got to anticipate the impacts of climate change occurring and that's where adaptation the seat belts and air bags of climate change response comes in another way the city takes on mitigation adaptation it's through preparedness plans\nDuring a climate change round table in April the Cambridge development department presented the al ... plan there John ... the city's environments plan or we heard from earlier laid out a climate change preparedness plan for the allies neighborhood\nThis neighborhood takes top priority since it is the area and Cambridge most vulnerable to the damaging effects of climate change\nThe poor neighborhoods will be next and the city will finish with a full plan for all of Cambridge by the end of twenty Eighteen\nThen there's that third piece of climate change response restoration of course we're having to avoid a disastrous question it feels like a distant dream because we have to plant so many trees and vegetation that their photosynthesis would remove more carbon from the air than we're adding to it then we could reverse the process that's destabilizing or climate\nRight now though the opposite is happening still Clinton remains hopeful\nWe are pretty clearly committed mitigation adaptation kind of a no brainer because obviously we prepare for what I mean and what's happening so people are getting on board with that\nAnd we're still in the beginning stages of advocating for unmarried executing on on restoration but I'm ... oh no single will continue to make progress on that front\nThree of these points mitigation adaptation of restoration\nThese include the Cambridge Energy alliance that helps residential and small businesses produce energy consumption and the Dr green electric vehicle discount program as well as other initiatives focused on urban forestry waste production storm water management and our supply of safe drinking water to name a few\nSo the city's doing a lot but what's exciting is that action doesn't have to be at the city level\nCommunity organizations are playing a critical role in shaping the city's response green Cambridge who's director Steven that are we heard from earlier gets involved in city policy matters they draft policy proposals for city council and organized members to show support for climate related community marches and rallies\nBut they're more than organizers they're also implemented is leading the expansion of things like composting solar power and tree planting across Cambridge\nHere's one example of how they're taking action we mentioned the heat problem at the top of the episode remember that quick easy way to combat the heat problem preserve and plant trees green Cambridge advocates for planting new trees as well as preserving old ones\nShe even talking about their new heritage tree initiative whose main focus is to inform the public about Cambridge is trees some of which have been around for centuries and an effort to build a coalition of like minded individuals and organizations that can better support policy change that encourages a lush tree canopy\nIs a great way for people just ah [noise]\nYou know for someone to be in their neighborhoods or or just walk down the so called the tree is from ... and we do have some traditionally conservative on which is pretty pretty amazing\nGreen Cambridge is tree initiative is a fantastic example of how everyday people can get involved in responding to the effects of climate change and it's just one example the organization is engaged in other efforts like ...\nPort is a Cambridge port based group that promotes community strategies for sustainable living and heat the home energy efficiency team organizers work parties the teachers' hands on energy upgrades skills check out our show for more info on all these organizations and more and that brings us to the final part of her episode you\nWe started off by addressing climate change as a global issue then got into his local impacts then discuss what to say can do about it and what community groups could do about it and there's still room to get engaged so how can you make a difference on climate change well we asked vice marriage and Deborah and here's what she said\nI think I'm One of the reasons that I've been\nLiving as much\nTime I'm Talking about transportation issues um you know bike safety and lost her husband had a hearing last week about you know service improvements for\nOffice is [noise] because that is\nA very tangible way that people\nChange their habits and help reduce our common you know and it's not that everybody has to stop driving immediately and never again in a car again it's just not making getting in your own car driving along somewhere in the fall choice\nThat's table stakes look at your personal choices and figure out how you can make them greener but you can think even bigger than that take Clinton's under Ben who gave us that car crash analogy he's out of Cambridge city councilor but he's always been interested in nature if you're passionate about the environment and want to make a difference he's spending your spot\nIn Nineteen Ninety nine he and his wife last small condo in Boston one day when seeking out the trash he couldn't find a way to put the recycling he called the condo management company and found out that they didn't have recycling in the building\nThat was really surprised you know after all these years or sugar\nAnd back and forth with them a bit and any day for the world [noise] or [noise] [noise] [noise] for sure that all of a few brother\nHe called me and then he and his office and after almost a year of talking with the mayor's office the kind of management company and the board of trustees Clinton got his recycling bin\nHe since gone on to run to environmental nonprofits and serve on city council but it's important to remember he started as a private citizen concerned about recycling if you want to you can get involved to a few years before running for office quitting was part of a huge new policy in Cambridge\nRemember the net zero action plan he was one of the main instigators of that initiative while they had a green Cambridge Clinton was approached by my Connelly now state representative who wanted his help to fix a flaw in the city's pledged to reduce emissions\nSo we were a little bit annoyed by that dichotomy that on one hand the worst thing that you were going to take\nOff for a mission to do something about it on the other hand we're allowing building build it or not he was still at a detour overall emission will fall\nDidn't like Connelly and green Cambridge board member John picking came up with the net zero zoning petition that energy plan our sets that are still mentioned earlier\nIt required new large buildings a five thousand square feet or more to produce net zero emissions\nCity council was open to it the position was proposing but had a few issues with its structure so that ultimately decided to take no action on the petition meaning you could expire and be refiled\nOpponents re filing included even more sweeping regulations that would apply not just to new buildings larger than five thousand square feet but to existing buildings of all sizes as well\nThis time the position past remember it\nAs producers buildings Clinton ran for city council on a platform of environmental sustainability if you feel like you can't make a difference just look at when\nHe said the little things like getting those recycling bins for his condo complex showed him that he did have the power to make change\nEven as a private citizen if you want to get involved start small and that's the thought will leave us we live in a city\nThat's emerged as a leader in climate change preparedness and as citizens that creates a unique opportunity to engage with our community and push for change that can inspire others elsewhere\nThat's it for today\nTune in next time when we explore another issue facing our city until then thanks so much for joining us I'm living on late and Cambridge this is your backyard [noise]\nBack\nHere Cambridge is brought to you by backyard media this episode was reported by me it would be ... it was produced an edited by Michael ... with help from the ... only on E. and married of Sanford wins on a van with our advisor for this episode on climate change\nFull disclosure quit and provided a lot of advice about climate change policy as we reported this piece students expertise in the area\nAnd he's featured quite a bit throughout the episode\nHowever our staff made all final editorial decisions about what to include a huge thank you to Clinton for his support as we created this episode\nOr they think he's right and if you use for this episode John ... Doug brown Steve another ... and ... as well as John ... who we spoke to but weren't able to include\nThe archive audio from our intro comes from CNN\nABC News the CBC and CSPAN think he tried generous donors who support hopes of continue providing coverage of important Cambridge issues every month also think you to the ...

bowed shower thoughts do you think that [noise]\nShower thoughts about shower thoughts should really be considered shower thoughts because I mean I feel like ... our thoughts are just supposed to sort of comes to you but like in this case\nThe the whole point like the whole idea of showers was infected into my brain because I walked into the shower and therefore it's not really like freely coming to me because I'm like isolated and alone I'm just like\nIt's just I don't know it's so [noise]\nShower sauce [noise] wow [noise] oh crap I forgot to wash my hair you know what it's fine that that's

be\nOr that it's not it's spelled W E a T E R water\nFires you're the professor [noise]\nYeah it's a good point yeah\nYou know what when we walk into that lecture hall you just walk right up to that professor shot from aside and started giving a lecture as soon as soon as he sees your confidence he'll he'll be sure to let you do it\nYou know it's not a bad idea\nAll right I'm Down\nThere this is going to be a huge scene I Love it when there's a scene in lecture and makes it almost makes everything else worth it\nOr you want to you already yeah let's go [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nYeah there's no professor in fact I don't see any point in here and it's dark\nYou know the first time I've seen twenty six one hundred completely empty\nOut of this happening to class get canceled\nI dunno it's November thirtieth Nineteen sixty eight so I wouldn't actually knows a lot has been cancelled\nHuh\nWell you know this isn't the day of the final is it oh God we missed it we missed it didn't really know its November oh it's not this isn't the day of the mid term is it oh God we missed it we missed it I mean I've already missed my last six mid term just can't keep happening what that that is\nSomething that comes work anyway uh I guess we can uh I don't I don't want to you when you want to study\nStudy yeah I mean I guess that's the least we can do and then and then the next time we see the professor we can really tell them what's what\nActually now that I think about I don't know if I were ones and actual us oh ... which was kind of makes sense\nBut that at all but that might be because I missed the last six lectures\nYou know that actually you you might be right there right uh let's uh let's say that when we go back to it too hard tore them so we can study for the wow what a what a waste of time\nI should have just stayed in the shower\nHaving such good shower thoughts too\nActually now that we were talking about politics is that'd be a two seconds ago\nI asked so [noise]\nWhat what do you think about uh are you know our sense and on and on Vietnam\nVietnam Vietnam [noise]\nWow well for like Vietnam not the other Vietnam [noise]\nUh I I mean\nI usually just kind of try to keep my head down around these sorts of things in the house say anything controversial banned because you keep putting your head and keep bumping into people\nWell I mean I just had to protect myself like you know you gotta stay safe when\nDangerous topics come up in conversation so naturally I just put my head down sometimes even in the sand [noise]\nSo I heard from a from a professor or like a park that uh that America is a\nBoy you know America gets to be an isolationist country right\nYeah yeah I remember yeah well I mean I wasn't there but like I I remember ... neither was oh no I was the topic but I wasn't there when America was an isolationist country yeah yeah no there's no butter so this is a professor at least you professor debating about uh what we should do I think one of them was a\nNon not know a ... I don't see non ski\nSki ... like I tried to call them ... I mean it's like an ethnic nickname he has here uh anyway and now I Am everybody who's tight with with ...\nNon whether we should pull out or we should pull in\nSunday was uh we should pull in a in Knoxville pulling out right so yeah and Bundy was saying is like I you know we should intervene with like all these conflicts in software charms non ski or a a was a no we should should not do that\nOr another professor wanted to weigh insane how America previously was an isolationist country but uh\nBut now it's the complete opposite\nRight well actually no it's not the complete opposite it's clear opposite of the opposite of that\nOr no no no no no it's the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of that so in reality America is actually a reverse inverse backwards isolationist country\nRight and in the sense that we\nHesitate to intervene\nAnd all conflicts and then we decided okay we're going to keep to ourselves and not do anything but then in ... pressure from her consist when say no you've got to intervene and so now we're in and we'll be right that makes sense the whole uh you know rivers inverse backwards isolationism that America has yeah that makes perfect sense\nYeah of an allegory that or don't\nHuh had her home now\nOh wow sweet I barely noticed the time go by right\nWell cool I guess uh well like I got to\nKill now I'll put on a though with yes I I like having heard some music and all today so I'll just to see what they're playing\n\nNight's in groovy [noise] kind of nice feet [noise]\nLittle on the quiet side maybe you should uh kick that oh okay I mean I thought you wanted to study [noise]\nSo I'm thinking I'm like why would I started now honestly [noise] hey you guys [noise] hello [noise]\nWhat you guys do well I was just sitting here listening to music kind of building out\nUh [noise]\nYou ever heard of a [noise] from him by name of having the weary [noise] I'm Sorry you have something caught and your throat [noise]\nNow this is my hand oh yeah that makes sense sometimes sometimes my hand get stuck in my throat to anyway I I but that only happens when I get ...

I don't know but those are real head bangers right there [noise] oh I don't know the the term head bangers is used in Nineteen sixty eight\nOh yeah I basically invented that term\nMe going to the symphony head banging oh it's great [noise]\nNext thing you know you're going to tell your nuts are telling me that uh you've been a marching at these places you know a term that has an that won't exist until one of the decade at least\nI don't know I'm offering is but sometimes I go to the front of the stage where the conductor is and I just grab some random person from the audience and I started like shoving them\nPicked out but I I really just don't know what the big deal it's like people should just you know get with it [noise]\nHey ah your you beat next door and here\nWe're just listening to the pretty music sir [noise]\nIowa have you know I've been working around the race Mary I'm I've been saying why young fellows like you are you all happen to have your draft card by any chance\nOh no this is what you said I should turn into a screenwriter ah sure that's the appropriate thing that I Would say\n... or ... or ... or ... but I I started screaming they'll kick me out of the symphony again this will be the sixth time in a row I Can't have that happened I'm just curious because I've already been I think we're going to hide All right okay I'm I'm running sorry or I have to go I have to go to a stranger danger\nArab and we got we got to go to that we're going to go to the workers were home on campus killing hall whenever those go we've got to be I Can't miss a thing we're gonna hide there was another music drown ourselves in the musical just who's ... All right let's go to whatever it is let's go All right [noise]\nThat's much better much more because it is I seem like really heightened a Buckeye [noise]\nBut the people when the instruments for just like\nVery stiff\nAnd they're not they well I guess pretty relaxed to me there I mean they're definitely very coordinated and it doesn't get to blend in their origins shame it it it\nIt doesn't help that they have like actual poll tape to the back of their facts to keeping their posture screen [noise] well I mean they say good good posture and good technique cars go hand in hand in good technique makes GOOD Music All right well let's listen to us for a band and then I won't see once in a while [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis way or the\nReally sweet tea [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nBut says\n\n\n\nOkay we're back on near that was nothing can hurt you baby buy cigarettes after six\nAnd this is the light tiger with Alex and Alex and Mac I Can't believe I just called myself Alex [laughter] friday insulin maybe [laughter] well um\nUm oh what oh I remember when I was gonna do okay the ... oh yeah well it slows the ... the day I'll read it you and you can guess actually you'll never be able to guess it's called the song of wandering I is\nIs it by someone famous see if you can guess but [laughter]\nOkay\nI went out to the hazel would because the fire was in my head and cut in peeled hazel wand and hope to bury to a thread and when white mouse we're on the wing and mosque like stars were flickering out I dropped the berry in his dream and caught a little silver trapped\nWhen I had laid it on the floor I went to blow the fire flames\nBut something Russell it on the floor and someone called me by my name it had become a glimmering girl with apple blossom in her hair who call me by my name and ran and faded through their brightening hair\nThough I Am old with wandering through ... an illegal ends I Will find where she has gone and kiss her lips and take her hands and walk among long ... grass and pluck till time in times are down the silver apples of the moon the golden apples of the some\nOf this is a shot in the dark but is it like what's his name TS Eliot no ah before TS Eliot I got no idea\nI heard the tone but yeah yeah I I really like the rhythm in this home even though I was a big aids fan actually didn't find it\nThrough reading his collection or studying him it was indirectly through TV show that I heard ... TV show or the leftovers and never talk to you about those no not really it's it's my favorite TV show of all time basically\nLike I wouldn't know that it was really your favorite TV show all the time I talked a lot of other people that it just gets just don't care about what what are your favorite TV show all the time I don't think I have a favorite TV you don't live your life or if you'd be that way I Do like TV you don't like me I don't like movies at Monterrey\n\nHello okay so the reason I think this song is\nWeird or no worthy is because the whole songs about him apologizing to the mother of someone who's hardy broke\nWhich is just such a strange proposition right he seemed like he really doesn't care about miss Jackson's daughter right or I mean not necessarily well it it's all that all that is true that not necessarily but it's a weird thing to make a song out of right\nYeah and I mean it would be kinda weird if she really did cry like the Hawaiian like I didn't mean to make you cry apologize like ... a trillion times a trillion times like didn't mean to make your daughter crime oh really yeah oh okay I didn't mean and they can do to cry yeah actually that makes a lot more sense\nIt's just why is he talking to the mom after he's broken up with the girl economy right now as race it's\nDamn I'm like that's for sure uh weirder saw like apologizing to I I ... I don't\nThink so I actually don't think so because it's a common thought that you I mean do you think someone's mom is hot when you're at high school I think or it's not on it's not uncommon for for that to be written about it to be thought that wow you know this this\nGirl who's in my class in high school actually has like a very attractive mom or something you know but I think it's weird or to be apologizing to the mom of the Gulf of ex girlfriend that is just a stranger scenario I think\nYeah it\nYeah I think it might be in there too long yeah there's not much like the same I mean there I think you can't exactly say that it took a ...\nYeah yeah there's ...\nI Can't see anything in your that really substantiate so what I like my hypothesis\nYeah\nOkay think matter here we go [noise]\n\n... you know for me [noise]\n\nMy name's ... I'm just saying it's still living in Manhattan\n\nThat's okay because I had\n\nIt was this guy and that has a show and they in the ...\nOf the people\nShouldn't say when why then why bother to do that and then having a\nOr\nThe lie then bombing\n\nThat ah [noise]\nWhat draws you was such a habit become famous so but I had to tell myself now she better with my fellow with the regular job I didn't want to get involved in and it's been mentioned in an all out into my car drove from\n... to close and I remember my mental Reno shop but an iguana like when the building on the clock stop what am I usually get to kind of body that would probably get to any of 'em that went on to not meet cousin models of made a model\nThat girl going to be forgotten all in the world and we can hold him when he's another friend I Need to hold your hand TV no other man we meet the other night\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou do it in the in\nNot had not gone there\nOkay that was being batter very famous channel orange yeah I think\nAndres verse elevates the song to one of the great songs on channel which and I actually think Andres first in this song is one of the better\nI think there's two thousand twelve yeah it's still within the decorating for me my favorite\nPart of the song and still all the other stuff but also I have no idea who Andrea was a ... thousands\nA legend he\nHe's just got really really tight internal or just sense of rhythm in time and creativity his sense of flow is very different to any of the rap or if you're listening closely he's extremely inventive you really changed the game but I I think it was\nI mean it just it flows you know he's he's like I really I I think that also the line that's really funny is that\nIs that she had the kind of body that would probably intimidate any of them that were on southern not me cousin like I think that's so funny he's like I just like fat girls or something or like big girls\nUm yeah\nWhat what what are the parts of the fondue liked like\nA sort of ways he plays on like the matter like the different colors of\nMatter mhm think matter purple matter\nYeah ray matter I think there are more\nActually I just I just picked I just realized that so the bridges gray matter blue used to be my favorite color now ain't got no choice blue matter\nBeing matter and the pink\nIt's it's partly an exploration\nOh an exploration of his like of his sexuality right 'cause I mean I I always heard secondary things about Frank Ocean being bisexual Frank Ocean is just ... you know he's bisexual\nI mean I'm not I'm not entirely sure but it's like the song Forrest Gump is especially about that\nMaybe we can play that next and\nThis is this part um what do you think my brain is made for is it just to continue for the mind this great gray matter since they replied what is your woman she just to continue for the child that soft pink matter mhm yeah\nOr one of them are like on a day or so it was that low rider\nAnd love living on a little\nThe challenger clinicians alone\nThe women don't seem to do in\nThe ... the guideline that how do they\nRound going round and [noise]\nWhen you tell you about that you mean\n\nI had no reason [noise]\nThe first time when when it was only one yeah the only time we went\nThe only well what's your what is your recollection of that concert in a while ago\nRead a lot of I mean it was like a lot of older people\nVery sort of missed the almost like some sort of like\nThe Lakers behind the lighting and this guy was kind of like looking kind of homeless and\nShovels yeah for like everybody there had like real instruments like a real concert kind of that you don't see very often anymore Alexa phone stocks are like so many playing the drum but one of the real fans type thing\nGoing on you know I mean that you definitely still do especially it it's just like I don't I don't really see it\nSo much anymore [noise] yeah [noise]\nThat's that's true [noise] just remember the guy that we stood next to vaguely vaguely sort of science\nGuy not built by\n[laughter]\nHe wasn't a I mean he's a research ... yeah I did research at the Lincoln labs\nYeah that was it but I remember that\nI thought he was pretty good looking like he's kind of short [laughter]\nI think I Do remember he was like a pretty good looking but he was kind of short and use a boxer too I don't remember is so much maybe you are more into that I was yeah I kind of into and yeah ... ... you should shoot shot next time [laughter]\nI'm I'm not not the right direction but\nIt was\nIt was such a cool venue I think that's my favorite venue in Boston or there's purple lighting low ceilings cool people and GOOD Music too and they gave me this press pass sticker which was pretty awesome I had it on my notebook for he's just\nSinclair yeah it's pretty cool so I I recommend the St Clair I think it is a great venue it's not it's not too big so it can improve small yeah yeah I can ever be to ... or just\nKind of overwhelming thought the ... or at least it wasn't a Bible that concert um yeah kind of like people in their thirties standing there but then again\nWhen like when we went to see the higher brothers that was a similar size venue right\nI Would say it was like larger first of all I leave a larger yeah and also I mean it's just different\nBut the higher brothers ... I mean they would never perform at the St Clair because I don't think the Sinclair invites that kind of mean Adam's do you know what kind of artist I think it's ... it's like ... yeah that is that true other venues like I mean it's not really about the vibe that the venue 'cause like if you just did the lighting a little\nBit different and had a different crowd in there it could be fairly different I think\nYeah but I Do think the Sinclair normally have those kinds of I mean I Do think it's a little small for their uh\nYeah ... type of thing where everyone's jumping up and down yeah the higher brothers thing was also kind of funny and weird\nYeah it was interesting enough the ... most Chinese thing I think I've ever [laughter]\nI've been to in years yeah I mean I'm sure\nInto something more Chinese just like what I just can't think of it like oh like one of those like Chinese like masks which dances what China you know like they do that like there's like these Chinese ladies and dresses and then they like go behind the curtain and they suddenly switch who they are and\nI'd never seen that I mean I'm just saying that there's a lot of things like that yeah well you know what they say raptors the new religion\nAnd China oh yeah actually know nobody knows that I I just say that I I think they thought I mean right now\nSo you think in the absence of of a religion you kind of have to worship something where people do worships on [laughter] and then they just turn to know um you know that's what I'm David Foster Wallace once said really yeah well I guess we think are like\nOh yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah yeah\nYou said um everybody worship something and the only choice that we get in this world is a choice of what to worship\nBut that yeah but that's only if you're aware that you wish you have to be something but yeah I think that's kind of true yeah what do you think you worship um\nI think\nTough questions yeah\nGreat authors David Foster Wallace [laughter] I I Wish you great literature and great I don't I just think that's not it [laughter] yeah I also don't think that's it yeah I guess I Wish if I say what's it\nIt's also some things are on worship of all what do you mean by that like you might think you worship it but you don't\nUm I Am trying to think of something\nFor example I don't think you can really worship a sport for example I mean it's that you could worship the sport\nBut through like more I'm On a deeper level you worship for example like achievement or like\n... or they synonymous same thing\nI suppose it's like an extreme sense of value right like the point to where you valley something so much that it like dictates a lot of how you act and how you feel\nI mean it seems to me I have an object to swell right but can't value in like ... you value something I bet I feel like Russia has to be embodied\nKind of for example a real value you can valley being altruistic right you can't really worship being altruistic ... or whatnot because it it I mean that I don't think it'll do but\nLike you could value I mean why don't people it's because you can't really I think that like you can worship something that's not concrete\nI mean you can but it has to be\nSomething\n... like you can worship like money or power um\nAny sort of like a lot of like a large range of sort of like like maybe it has to be there there is a difference though and it's not just that one's more extreme than the other\n... Inc yeah well I think the reason you can't worship altruism is more just that I mean maybe you could maybe there's some extreme person who does right worship being altruistic yeah\n[laughter] to the point where like all they care about is like trying to do nice things what do you think you worship or value this I think they are different question so okay what do you think you value\nThan\nFriends friends that's kind of generic isn't it you could ... say specific\nFor us [laughter] it's oddly specific isn't it [laughter] yeah\nSocial social standing among people similar mindsets\nMaybe good grades [laughter] yeah\nLong I don't think you'd find a way back home but it's going to make you a person is the best thing to happen to a shelter that be that person adopt ... by the council and the shelter pet project dot org\nWNPR in Cambridge now in the air\nAs a community service of MIT W ... operated by the technology Broadcasting Corporation and it operates from studios in offices will be Milwaukee\nAnd also from transiting facilities and help to keep the building Kendall Square\nAre cold dying WMD are is they're registered service mark the technology Broadcasting Corporation\nWe broadcast to Cambridge and the greater Boston area Landon did on an assignment center frequency of eighty eight to one megahertz FM channel two oh one\nOf the nonprofit broadcast organizers and WNPR relies on this and her contributions for partial simple jackets operation\nGeorge kept deductible donation as well as your comments regarding our programming at\nWMD are three in Cambridge, Massachusetts older one and a forward to\nThat as a captain knocks board for this stuff and men are going\nTo have WMD are wishing you and most pleasant good morning Andy Swedish dumpster [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWNPR in Cambridge now returning to the air as a community service of MIT WNBA ours owned and operated by the technology Broadcasting Corporation and operates from the studios and office is located in the Walker memorial building at MIT and from transmitting facilities atop the east gate building Kendall Square Cambridge\nOur call signed WNPR is it registered service mark of the technology Broadcasting Corporation\nWe broadcast to Cambridge and the greater Boston area on that in a sinus center frequency of eighty eight point one megahertz FM channel to zero one\nHas a nonprofit broadcast organization WNPR relies on listening\nRamming efforts may be addressed to W.

C. A. CCAs stands\nFor community choice aggregation\nThat's Jessica Tovar from the local clean energy alliance I guess a less fancier where it would be like pulling like when you ... for example so people get together and act as their own company and then you can choose where to buy energy don't want dirty energy don't buy\nIt you can buy clean energy instead in a sea ca you get to choose this model has already started an Alameda County in northern California and now they did an early launched this summer and then I think a full launched this fall\nAnd so they will provide Alameda County with different levels of green energy so it's like a certain percentage all the way up to one hundred percent renewable energy here's the second ingredient locally produced so you've got the buying power now where do you find the energy what about those big\nSolar panel farms out in the desert when no one lives you\nKnow but the truth is people live in the desert there's wildlife that lives in the desert Flora and fauna there's you know so you're still destroying that ecosystem\nAnd we're trying to really emphasize you know that local is better and we need to start doing that now local is better in this case we mean locally produced\nIn the ground is so you do have to pay a small fee to use it but you're micro British autonomous and can be turned on and off without affecting the whole municipal system Wall Street for example has its own generators and during Hurricane Sandy when the power went out in New York\nWall Street stayed in business kept their lights on and that's the kind of\nResiliency that we need for our\nCommunity forget Wall Street right like if there's a disaster like that we need that kind of infrastructure here\nWe're pushing for a micro create in Chinatown for example which isn't a vaccination site for downtown but is not great resilient yet and there are a number of community health clinics elementary schools libraries that could be real community centers in the case of the climate disaster\nAnd this hyper local model could create new jobs in my mind\nImagine Alameda County or whatever county live in an imagine all the commercial building all the municipal buildings and then all the housing and multi family kind of building solar rise when you look at solar in that way that's a large project\nThat's a long term job this kind of vision is kind of model it's the first of its kind and it's because of organizing\nIt is visionary and so far the model isn't as testing phase and there are some potential issues corruption is a possibility but advocates say that that can be avoided when people get involved with their CCAs to make sure that their democratic and transparent the larger problem they say\nIs that the utility companies aren't exactly happy about CCAs are committed ... choice aggregation\nI feel like every year dealing with the the legislature there's always a bill and there's always some kind of gotten amend and sneaky language that gets thrown in\nYeah Pacific gas and electric is trying to raise the exit fee\n[noise] that's a fee you pay if you leave their system\nIf they raise enough most people can't afford to leave Pacific gas and electric in order to join us DCA but the fight isn't over humidity controlled clean energy is a growing movement all across the U.S and we'll be keeping an eye on its progress here at making contact\n[noise] you're listening to making contact to listen to any past shows the guys who are pod cast interrupted\nMore support our word radio project that or you can help us do

controversy is brewing in northern California regarding the expansion of the Phillips sixty six refinery the oldest in the bay area\nWhile the refinery has been in operation since mid fifties new concerns have been prompted by plans to bring in even more oil and crude shipments including tar sands called by some the dirtiest crude oil on the planet\nAnd neither Johnson has our report [noise]\nTwenty five miles north of San Francisco and the small town of rodeo California Google community activists gathered to protest the propose expansion of the Philip sixty six refinery\nHouston base oil giant wants to increase productivity of gas oil what concern about the impact on the environment and the community health has prompted opposition from local residents and environmental justice advocates\nFor the residents like and punch believe that the expansion will severely hurt her community well\nEvery day we live with fear of what's going on at the refinery\nThe voice and what's happening in our lives\nIn August of this year the bay area air quality management district granted permission for the facility to start processing sixty nine thousand barrels that's four thousand more than the previous year I just subtle an organizer with the Richmond based group communities for a better environment explains\nThat permit is for what they call it catalytic cracker you and\nThis is the unit and the refinery where the heat up the crude oil they infuse it with the chemicals like self your gas and hydrogen to break the molecules\nOf the crude oil that then have different weights and the siphon off those gases in order to make the various products what this does is this is part of a piecemeal expansion of the general Philip sixty six row Dale refinery operation\nOr we are making the case that they are illegally\nPiecemeal use by one application for the war one application for the cracker you one application\nFor the ... activity when in fact this should all be taken into account under one larger environmental impact report and the land use permit process through Contra Costa county\nSo by expanding the fluid catalytic cracker unit by four thousand barrels capacity\nOr what it means is they're going to be able to process more crude it's not a significant expansion but the fact that it's any expansion as opposed to reduction means they're moving in the wrong direction\nIt's still a sixty six proposal is set to more than double it shipped deliveries of crude and gas per year the potential impacts on the environment and communities near the refinery can truly catastrophic on just soda\nSabine blazing and Lisa vitamin and swim hammer Ronnie thanks for listening to making contact\n[noise] [noise] and they can see nice

watch 'em but he was just like why can't I have like\nSuper eats for voting you know like dance here with your pizza and your ballot they rented vote\n[laughter]\nThat sounds like a great way that does sound so great um but anyway so transportation with number three on the list of reasons why you don't vote so like\nIsn't it is important like there is something to be said about providing more transportation opposite in the polls you know we did talk about her I mean we've talked about should it be less job or should it be a different way to do it\nUm but um\nProblem is is it like from the place where they live to the polling station probably not right\nYeah I could be right it could be from from work or somewhere or school or somewhere else yeah I think that's hard to answer I'm not in the earth's from you know the report\nYeah 'cause like I don't like I think that would be um a better way\nOf understanding why transportation is an issue especially for young people to get to the polling station like if they're busy if\nThey don't um yeah if they're busy and they don't really uh enjoy the candidate like\nIs this also in because like they can't access the polling station uh from where they are where they're being busy where where whether that's like school or work or um\nThey're just you know spending most of the time somewhere else that is not their neighborhood mhm uh which I can totally see how much time did you spend in your neighborhood five years ago\n[laughter] so old person here [laughter]\nOr some other interesting things from the report so a transfer compared to other issues transportation just print just proportionally affects youth without college experience for thirty five percent without college experience side of that as an issue versus Nineteen that that had that had gone to college\nAnd I also just fortunately affects people of color yeah thirty eight percent of people who color side of that as an as a barrier versus twenty or twenty percent of white people so\nYeah so it's an interesting issue um [noise]\nShould be ... for some music for some music great yeah um\nWell\nFor a me some music and he has to say yes um but ah what's coming up is times are changing by Bob Dylan waiting on the world is changing my John Mayer and\nAccepted that boom you get the ball rolling\nIt was the worst day of and\nThen you better start
