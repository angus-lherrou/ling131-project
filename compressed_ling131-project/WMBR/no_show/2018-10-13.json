MIT\nThat was sound patterns composed by one of my favorite composers ... heroes and performed by the asked require directed by John McCarthy off of the album we like selling on swallows\nThis was from New world records from twenty Eighteen and this is part of the collection of music by Martin Feldman and ...\nOn verbal archipelago peace and she is a really avant garde composer her work consists of electronics drones ambient sound and so this is very on brand for her incorporating music that has\nMore improvisational environmental patterns using the brass\nTo set up these phrases that are built up and patterns and then released so this is a really interesting message to that reflects I think really well of her her overall style\nSo this is how we were starting the hour it's going to be quite an adventure there's a lot of fun stuff that I've found over the course of the week I\nWill say that I have found some really great work by various\nArtists that I haven't heard of before so pretty excited also going to play some music from\nThe lore lie ensemble I got to see to their members\nOn Sunday and that was really wonderful they were part of the ... ... is a larger concert series and it was really excited and this initial part of their program\nSo this was a performance of the little match that girl passion\nWhich was for four voices to him and two men and percussion played by the vocalist and there's also combine movement which I thought was really cool really innovative thing to do especially in a small space and this was done sort of in the round so you had for dancers moving around and\nAmong the vocalists it was really cool and I'm really glad I got to see the performance but I also got caught up catch up with Emily my passion Marco rude and\nEmily my ... part of the ... here\nSome ... has a new album out called him permanence which I Am slowly working my way through I'll let you know so one of the pieces there is a composition of Japanese haiku and square for is really complex and I started digging into it over the course of the week and\nIt is music notation I have never seen before so this is definitely going to be a learning experience for me but I'll play some that later in the hour\nBefore that we're going to go on some adventures the first being wasted you throw ... girls choir haven't played this album for

Stein it's actually a very complex poem and so\nTom says and sort of fell back on familiar modes of music to make this an accessible peace and the original cast was all black which was very unusual at the time\nAnd I've seen video clips of it on line and it looks really beautiful the set is very over done and very elaborate and this was part of this experimental\nIn your face vision of\nThe saints and moving through their lives and so this goes through\nDifferent times in different places centers around to resolve Abdullah who's actually doubled\nIn the rural who has two singers that way Thompson compose duets and she is joined also by St Ignatius and a bunch of other seemed like figures throughout the opera so this is one that I'm really interested in learning more about\nAnd I'm really excited to delve into this and delve into the collaboration between these two artists\nSo this is\nThe first song after the prelude this act one cow below one I went to play a couple of songs from the first act their\nFirst to tap blows are these very impressionistic pieces where you're setting the scene for what these characters are doing so this'll be a garden and Abdullah and then the

ever show to the things that I produce lord but\nThe UFO and somewhere oh I don't want to see that\nI can show you when we're back on her door but a first for those listening in on our last our last assignment was to basically make us animation reading thing um so what you have when you animate ... three\nOn top of that and each part of the skin is basically\nA connected to a couple of the joints so when you move the joints around\nUm the skin moves around and ... and ways that you would expect skin to deform I'm mostly nights mostly moms away yeah so I'm doing this assignment I got the joints to show up I got the bones to show up I moved the joints around in the bones don't follow the joints [noise] um\nAnd then I get the bones to follow the joints and I get the skin to show up in the skin doesn't follow the bones um\nAnd then what I Do get the skin to work as expected um it's not exactly the best um we did we aren't exactly using you know the top of the model animation techniques out here and so uh when when you bend things in a little bit too far\nAnd basically looks like those you know those um floppy two guys [laughter]\nOutside yeah car dealerships or something um [laughter] so when when you bend like a a joint too far and they just kind of look like those like\nYou know it's it's got this like really sharp edge they look like they're really inflated basically um the models behave like they're inflated so uh if you bend the knee like all the way like one eighty I'm back on it so that and um it looks very like squashed like as Erin it\nUm I got a next to go one

that does [laughter] it puts the head upside down incident chest and creates a whole or the next you\nKnow [laughter]\nOh no\nAbsolutely astonishing richer here but my laptop doesn't read it so ... that sounds so good oh my gosh\n\nI've seen at the beginning of a the opening for the second part of judges bizarre adventure part of it they used CGI right\nSo they had the CGI models and I saw what they had to do to get it to fit one of the poses because you know\nJoe Joe's bizarre adventure poses if you look them up\nYou'll see about how ridiculous they are but one character had like\nHis elbow up in a weird way and was like putting his face next to his hand and it was really strange I Can't quite do it because\nI don't think it's actually quite physically possible almost it looks like it is but it's not and just the things that it did to the model someone found it and like just turned it around so you could see the back\nAnd it was like\nPart of the shoulder had just become silly\nPotty [laughter] like flush colored silly plenty almost it was a little horrible\nAnimation it's difficult thirty mile [laughter] they're really not ethical [laughter]\nOh jeeze [noise]\nAll right we're

called language that you\nOh\nWhy oh [noise]\nSo\nLittle carried away as well um [noise]\nAnyway\nTo get as into them as other people but just like reading about them is fun you know mhm\nIt's fun to be a little over analytical and that's part of why I'm a literature major because\nA friend of mine explained this to me the other day the way she sees texts throughout the ages and\nShe had told me that she used to believe that you have to have every tax than its proper historical context but after reading an article in one of her classes\nShe thought that instead a story it's kind of like\nA story as it moves through time and as different people read it through time is kind of like a piece of yarn\nBut you've seen like the colorful yarn at Walmart and whatnot and it doesn't have to stay the same color all the way through out it's a span that it is red so that's the same way that the interpretations of attacks will change\nAnd some people get\nAbsolutely so into it and they dig into like the nitty gritty though really nitty gritty of each and every little bit and sometimes there are obvious points where someone is going too far but it's fun because you can really have your own interpretation of any text\nYeah yeah\nInteresting I kinda went off on a tangent in that discussion and that was originally about conspiracy theories [laughter]\nYeah I feel like it's like a over active pattern matching you know like mhm like humans are very good at pattern matching like you know how how do you know that all those posters on what it's like how do you know all these creatures that looked like dogs but like you know I always I mean that ... like vastly different\nLook like anything that's not a dog so [laughter]\nYeah 'cause the difference between say ... and the Russian Bear dog which is very fun to Google [laughter] they're very large in philosophy\nThe difference between like a Chihuahua and our Russian Bear dog is extreme so extreme but still instantly oh that's a
