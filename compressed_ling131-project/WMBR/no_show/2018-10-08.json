in blue median versus Bush that Guantanamo detainees held as enemy combatants have the right to file Haiti's corpus petitions in us federal courts to say on being unlawfully held but after ... end Kavanaugh on the court of appeals did his best\nTo try to neuter these habeas corpus rights that the Supreme Court has upheld in blue median in case after case and also\nKavanaugh has a at a record of dangerous difference to the president not withstanding the case of Jones versus Clinton the Paula Jones case which said that a president has to answer to at least a civil case that didn't involve a criminal case\nCabin odd doesn't think that a president should be bothered to answer to a civil or criminal case while he's in office and under us versus Nixon a unanimous Supreme Court said that Nixon had to turn over the tapes\nDuring the Watergate scandal and that led to Nixon's resignation and yet although that case us versus Nixon is this is a settled precedent Kavanaugh has said he thinks that should be reconsidered\nAnd one of the most disturbing things Janine is that in a law review article Kavanaugh wrote in twenty four teen he wrote that\nYes the take care clause of the constitution requires the president to enforce the law says that the president shall take care that the laws are faithfully executed but then cabin all went on to say yes the president has to enforce\nIsn't it can decline to follow this statute until a final court order says otherwise unquote soak Kavanaugh would create a dangerous presumption in favor of a president who refuses to follow the law that is very worrisome\nAnd it should be worrisome I should think two people of any political stripe you know allowing the president to make the law and there are references also well we're in war time but of course given that the war the war on terror it's like we're always going to be in war time so we can't really think about it as a as a temporary status\nYet that's the excuse for whatever the president wants to do oh we're fighting terrorism the war on terror the war on terror is a misnomer terrorism as a tactic it's not an enemy and yet under the guise of this so called war on terror Bush and Obama and now Trump are\nEstimating our civil liberties and Congress ah unfortunately not in every case and in some cases there's pushback\nBut largely the first to him and the court said the last resort to check and balance and out of control executive and yet with cabin on the court that checking and balancing is not going to happen\nIt seems important for the conversation to kind of\nA separate our concerns about Kevin on particular and then also this process but it's happening that's allowing him to advance in this way you know I mean there's the lack as Anita Hill pointed out in an op ed the lack of a\nProtocol for vetting charges of harassment are resulting confirmation hearings which should have been put in place before Clarence Thomas but certainly after\nThere's Jeff Flake thing\nWe're going to have an investigation by the FBI to last no longer than a week what kind of investigation decides how long it's going to last before it starts the process I think just seem so broken too\nBush is not a new thing but I don't know it's hard to see how anyone can going forward see the Supreme Court has a checker balance at this point\nI think you're absolutely right and I think when cabin on I say when because I think his confirmation is a foregone conclusion especially because\nThis so called FBI investigation which didn't even last a week this perfunctory investigation which ignored many people coming forward who had evidence including a professor at Princeton Theological Seminary who would confirm and corroborate the allegations of Deborah Ramirez\nWho said that cabinet waved his penis in her face and forcing her to touch it\nIt really is a farce but Collins and flake at least the two of them are getting political cover from this so called week long investigation uh saying there's no\nNew credible corroboration it was a thorough report whereas many many people and this is detailed in Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow is New Yorker article came forward and tried to contact the FBI saying that they had relevant information and yet the FBI did not contact them they gave it a lick and a promise\nAnd evidently you know a during his testimony Kavanaugh said oh I've been through six FBI investigations and there's never been a problem well actually during the FBI investigation for his appointment to the court of appeals\nThe American bar association reduced their very qualified rating to qualified because there were problems with his judicial temperament and we saw that on display in the hearings terrible judicial temperament I mean he was having tantrums he was aggressive he was\nActing a you know I Know you are but what am I with the senators which is just on heard of\nAnd I am proud to say that I'm One of more than a thousand ...\nShe'll temperament which is really really beyond the pale\nWell I understand that Chuck Schumer is asking for the FBI report to be made public along with the White House directive\nI imagine that many folks who see it will er would think well you know this was a sham but what does that outrage translate to you know what what can we do and is this a tipping point potentially for making actual structural changes to the court itself\nWell I don't know about structural changes I mean that's that's a tall order you see people in the streets today yesterday probably tomorrow and Saturday\nThe me too movement has really galvanized the whole issue of\nUh women and men and in some instances being afraid to come forward to report sexual assault\nBecause of feelings of humiliation or the ramifications and because of this time in history where Kavanaugh has been accused of these things in the wake of\nThe me too movement this has galvanized people all over this country and these people are not going to go away we are not going to go away we're going to continue\nTo pressure the branches of government and\nThe fact that there were two courageous women survivors of sexual assault\nIn an elevator with Jeff Flake in his face\nChallenging him is the only reason I think are certainly a primary reason that he agreed to this investigation this so called investigations so political pressure and I'm Talking about people pressure really does have an effect\nAnd we have to keep it up and people should be sitting in Collins' office and Murkowski and flake and mansion who are the swing voters and they should be around the block and they should be demanding that they vote\nYou so much Janine [noise]\nAmazon got a PR boost from its announcement that after considerable pressure it would raise workers minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour\nAfter we learned that the company would symbol tiny asleep be cutting monthly bonuses and stock options such that many warehouse employees have said they'll actually be getting less money\nThat sort of maneuver as one of the things that rubs many people wrong about Amazon now one of the country's largest employers along with responding to charges of abusive conditions by having select staffers maintain Twitter accounts in which they explain step for like how glorious it is to work there\nBut maybe most galling as the disc juncture between nickel and dime to employees some of whom report being in trash cans because bathroom breaks are recorded as time off task while Jeff Bezos is Richard ...\nAnd how is it that a company with paid employees you rely on food stamps and that demands tremendous subsidies from communities just to locate there can be held up by media as an exemplar of success\nIt matters whether we label Amazon a success without asterisks and whether we're okay with the extent of its tower\nOne with questions on that as journalists Neal demasi his latest book is
