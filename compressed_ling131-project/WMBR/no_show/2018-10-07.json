because of some scheduling conflicts I don't have everyone in here so [noise]\nI thought I'd do something kind of fun and and with some show tunes for it today in in the spirit of radio drama and radio theater I thought I put together a playlist of my favorite show tunes for the last Fifteen minutes or so\n[noise] but before I Do that I Would like to add one last comment which is that I'd love to dedicate this whole series the semester and and this particular episode um as well to to someone who I'm very close to it and that's my grandmother\nShe doesn't know this but she was actually a huge inspiration and putting us together uh I used to hear stories about how she would do radio drama I'm a as\nA young woman back in India and how she would write them and direct them and get kids in the neighborhood to come together and play all of these parts to bring stories to life and I thought it was an incredible concept and\nWas hoping to find a way to be able to do it here and luckily WNPR it was a ... outlet for that so a dedication to her and trying inspiration from from her past endeavors [noise]\nWhat's that let's move on to short Fifteen minutes segment of some fun show tunes
