at a a semi New England mid Atlantic actually they tore nationally so\nI don't know but I met their to their book lists locally so to me either a local and sample but ... all women directed by Beth wheeler\nBeautiful folk ensemble really powerful and ... a really incredible musicians that I've had the opportunity to meet an host on MBR two of their real close Margaret rude and Emily ...\nAnd ... have kept\nIn touch with them such that I just found out that they dropped a new album just last month called him permanence and it's really exciting I've just gotten a chance to give it a lesson\nSo I'm playing it from the song cycle composed by Peter Gilbert commission for the ensemble called Suki me\nWhich is the Japanese celebration of the full moon and it is also the autism lunar festival and so there's poems based on\nThis festival and this time of\nThat ... are sort of the the hike to what we call haiku now and these were originally called um originated from the poetry of the time called ...\nAnd the condensed form of ... are now known as how cool or as we call it an English haiku and so there's an anthology of the time that the composer pulled from and creates these short and brief little\nThis is a collection of those poems I've played the first three and they're really brief if you didn't notice it\nSo the first was ... no ... the second was a key cause any and the second was Suki me up and they\nAre\nPerformed in the original Japanese\nAnd ...\nHas very dense and beautiful imagery so the\nTranslations of some of these are\nAs follows\nUm ah no hata when to have been playing I look up with a wide stretched gay is over ... and over mount mi casa is the rising moon is am\nI keep costs and me in the autumn when our lingering hanging clouds in who's trailing rifts come shining through the moon's own reflected light clear and bright\nSuki meter by as I view the moon many things come into mind and to become sadness get it's not for me alone that the autumn time has come\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday\nWas a man\nWho knows [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nOn the merits interpretation of Antonio of all these four seasons from the album on all four seasons I played at three selections from the album slumber stillness and chase and these were\nPerformed by the Scottish ensemble as part\nOf the top ... um\n\nYeah I think it was the b._b._c. pop or BBC problems sorry and it was done with like\nA whole ... show and so this is a composer very interested in exploring before that we had room full of teeth from there one of their motor recent albums render seeing the song invest Prospero\nComposed by one of my favorite composers missing as Ali and before that was an instrumental peas I Know that his voice box but a branching out\nEighth blackbird ca playing still life with ... from their album meanwhile\nAnd so that was really interesting one so I thought I'd take a moment and update you on arts happenings in the Boston area this weekend and in the future one that I'm very excited\nAbout that I didn't know about was the pin drop sessions at air not brewery in Somerville or not has been building up their arts programming recently and they're really\nThey do a lot of really interesting events I've started to see in the space so\nThey do more popular vaudeville also like singer songwriter things that they are also doing high art which\nIs really exciting they've also hosted a few weird folk fest which have been a part of so it's really interesting to see how this space has evolved over the course of the last three or four years so the uh\nHangs piece a true Pearl premier but also there was an adaptation of the little magical passion which won the Pulitzer Prize\nAnd was premiered in two thousand H there was an adaptation that he wrote specifically for room full of teeth for which they did their own percussion that ...\nWas really wonderful to Calif somebody in concert had done the instruments for true Pearl and so this was a really wonderful thing to see them perform and I never actually seen it live\nSo the I got to see it live by room full of teeth and it was really beautiful and I engage with the tax no way I had it before and I've definitely played this piece on the radio or parts from this little opera on the radio before and just never really connected with it honestly\nUh knew it was good musically but had never really bonded with it and for some reason hearing it lived just really made me connect with the peace in a way hadn't before\nSo I'm going to play a little ... from that ...\nWhich it combines text from the ... the little match girl and also the passion according to St Matthew and the piece of that connected with the most was\nFrom the climax of the opera this tax which also which occurs at the time that the little match girl is freezing to death and also in the point in the gospel story where Jesus on the cross is dying and the text is called from the six hour\nFrom the six hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth our end at the ninth our she cried out Eli, Eli\nSo I'll play that for you but before I Do I'll let you know that there is another performance of the little match girl passion happening as part of the air and not pin drop sessions on Sunday at ...\nLike there's going to be a dance performance by Boston dance theater and two of the cast members are people I Know Margot rude and ... I'm Emily ... and so I'm really very excited that these artists are in Boston as part of this\nPerformance so that is coming up on Sunday evening the other thing I Will\nSay that I'm really excited about is flat earth cedars delicate particle logic which is going to be at the arsenal running now through the thirteenth and it's really an exciting play by Jennifer\nI'm black Jennifer Black more and it's about\nThe life Elise might nurse who if you don't know was part of the development and secret keeping around the atomic bomb in Germany and how it got to America and the work of\nAt least ... on these big players in the development of the nuclear age so I'm really very intrigued by this play I really love science theater so I'm really excited to see what that looks like\nSo if you're interested is running now through the thirteenth at the arsenal yes All right so I'm going to play some a room full of peace some more room full of peace starting with this song from\nThere for er no I ...
