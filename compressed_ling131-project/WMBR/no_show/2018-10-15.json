Kaur her ruled by a sorry the artist is called on corporate [laughter]\nAnd the song is called ... or ... and we'll begin here and we'll have an amazing conversation about the use of drone mapping in much who Picchu and how it's helped researchers\nUnderstand things and studied more things about the site so we're happy to have you with us please stay tuned [noise]\n\n... ... ... ... ... ... [noise]\n\n\n\nThe MIT ... in Argentina program I'd ... um I I'm originally from ... from the north and part of Chile and um I grew up pretty close to the\nCulture the Indian culture or around or Peru Bolivia and of course ...\nSo um when I um got closer to work with those countries sat through a MIT and misty a it was a great opportunity for me to go back a little bit to my own personal history\nCan we talk for just a moment about that song we just heard [noise]\nUm so it'll come to pass a a ... a it is said to be the second national anthem of through it is um song who has brush and um who has like four thousand ...\nSenior and thousand four thousand version has a in the last fifty years uh I think the most popular in the United states is version of Simon and Garfunkel in the sixties um\nI was reading that they heard the song and traveling in Latin America and they made their own version of a ... a so it is definitely by far the most popular Peruvian traditional folk song in the world\nSo um can you tell us a bit more about uh the MIT per reprogram the kind of work that the program is doing and I'm sort of significance and with regards to what we'll be talking about today\n[noise] so they might deeper firms that didn't thousand fourteen um the the started ... of the national going field for science technology of the country\nIndustry of economy and ... they're drilling conceal the science and technology\nIn two thousand fourteen they sign or we signed MIT sign an agreement through misty with the ... to a fund three ... a year for three years between a fourteen Seventeen\nAnd today we'll be talking about one specific ... or ... project who was awarded in two thousand sixteen and it is there much be to um ... heritage project\nKnow I I've seen pictures I it looks nice but I don't know that much about it started like I think\nIt would be great to hear more about the history\nYeah yeah sure so I saw I saw another you attribute you is is part of a day in ... empire that's it one of the two most important thing really stations in in the Americas\nNow they're well three actually will stick us in my us and Mexico and the increasing through so it for the south for the south for us for that ...\nIs very important because it's a source of of a culture and identity and because they used to be a thoughts that went through all the old south of the Americas South America\nAnd including ... so so they they in a culture has a strong influence in all of American countries\nAnd so much a picture with me is in around the Fifteen hundred it's kind of a late\nCp ... dink empire was a far more more and more than that and it was discovered kind of discovered by a eat I'm being him in Nineteen eleven\nSo in Nineteen eleven much richer becomes relevant in the in the western world and because of the discoveries of you know I mean Tom and and the studies that he did in jail and I always pronounced dive that\nFeel yellow fever for us [laughter] he wasn't he was never injected uh-huh in our jail versus yard [laughter]\nI'm sitting hundred and fifty people be a long time and let you get your means all of them on time or it could be interpreted as being on thing too so you have to plan it until two thousand and five hundred meters heightened ways to get there\nSo yeah that's kind of a history of much of each other with\nYour uh well I I just want to also I'm like highlight how important the ... not only for the Peruvian culture\nMuch between us also a very relevant um uh it is very relevant for the Peruvian economy ... is one of the sources of a\nForeign I'm a ... one of his economic sources of ah the whole area of course but also for ... um I I just like you have friends that are have told you about how much will be two and a macho Picchu attracts a hundreds of thousands of tourists\nAll right and so if you go there today what will you see\nOh ... you will see the most amazing place [laughter] in a gym writer and I asked them I said at the much will be to a house or you you you can see and get things from ... from different perspectives so architecturally it is an amazing place but also has these\nHistorical and spiritual importance for the people and for the anti union cultures\nUm when you go there you can uh approach much be to us a U.S up to east this nation\nOr take pictures gets healthy and post everything to a social media oil and yet they there and meditate and think and actually try to absorb that leads to be the ... a\nReligious important of the play\nSo you're in here about the actual work that you did their research that you did there I'm going to talk a little bit about the origins of that project and um why it was something about the Peruvian government or thought would be very important\nWell so I Am in my group at MIT\nAnd directed by the professors that you're going to regret we do at the top heavy touch it which means that we document a importance ... world class sites around the world\nAnd to defend up to ... and to document them register them in and do [noise] and\nAlso I'm not I'm not I say the content et cetera so ... so far in his lobbies they have done it before I arrived ... they need it they ... they get picked her up on ... any fun\nSo I thought it would be a great contribution to have as some sites in America and then of course ed ... is is our neighbors [laughter] so so I saw the case so this is this is a relative on for for the world it to the\nEdge and in that sense it became important it came to me the idea that we should work day and try to connect with their own government as you mentioned\nIn with the European ... institutions like on a universities as it is other mentioned that the ... work\nAnd and yeah so that's how we started it started it I proposed to them I was like\nOh it was all you [laughter] so how is\nDrone mapping work I mean how's that working what can you do about that you can't get from normal let's say satellite imagery or other forms of mapping\nTwist to soften and five hundred meters height and are also other side's interests in surrounding meant to be too if we use drones that are lighter weight it it allows us to get to the ... and document them\nIn a very precise way so that's one of the advantages of of drone mapping\nA another advantage is that a\n... ... is is based on for the country so it's basically emerges and emerges and record the [noise] the current state of the site\nMeaning that if it's sunny they're there for the government you will have a record of that and because of the ... of the of their mothers and we can show\nAnd their their hobbies and how the time affect this type of of sites yeah so\nIn ... when the time of day or the time of season yeah\nThe general day of the time of the soon but also like the reconstruction and say for example immature be too has been restored some area so much of which has been restored twice and where it was possible for us to to document the top of that\nAnd and this is important in in a good logical and word PSAs heritage sites because depending on the approach that they can't they the country that is in charge of that site\nAnd the restoration it changes the restoration approach changes like for example for Asian cultures and also like let I Would say Latin American cultures it is a it is okay to restore the ... the the ruins\nEh but it's different in Europe in other places et cetera so so in that sense which is ... we can we can have\nThe drawings and and and not everything every detail and we'd we day read pictures but also ground pictures\nAnd and then we process these images through through a specific software that allows us to to get it three they mentioned my mother's\nAnd ah what did you do what are the final project a product actually look like when you do that\nSo they find that ... well we have a our ... our website they say MIT these dissent hate that's where you can go\nOver all of a work that oh great [laughter] that what is the what's the euro I let me let me get it okay well we'll have a back will come back to music or I can only do yeah\nAnd yeah yeah but that's really one of those look a highly realistic they are you they are they for the gravity mothers I Am\nI often use for at least to reality and for a moment it reality applications because of the of the level of detail that he's able that we're able to get through these in these tools\nAll right let's take a quick musical break we're going to hear something from Jorge ... in order to who's Jorge ... a ...\nHe is a composer and singer from or why um he has a\nHe's a medical doctor he started singing um like a U.S a and I'm about to end up as a Nineteen eighty nine in who why then he spotted a ... to achieve started like are playing in composing professionally for other\nSeniors and he finally by the police are first album us in early two thousand and\nThe Peruvian government start like sued the\nSites that that didn't already know about was there anything that came up in the research you were doing\nWell there are some theories and that that's kind of a tough because there are there different in theory about image to be to itself\nIs so much of it too was found eh when it was found in started to be documented I become eh\nNot in most of the abusing feeding her roof\nSo so\nIt was assumed that is some of the buildings were huts slots move or in some of them had a ... like ... they are going to a roof so they say it's regulation or that it recently National Geographic Vita a reconstruction of of how the roofs\nWhere I Am where but then following that the evidence of that conversation to ... ... that has to be much richer\nAnd but then these type of studies also show that at\nSome of the the conclusions that people have been thinking about\nIt different buildings et may may not be ... I don't know I mean the truth or we don't know\nSo for example they say it's the sci fi base where the shadows of the of the windows of some windows and keep the the ... ... if if you grow up in the floor and giving some shaped\nAnd they they they said they believe that this would seem like something\nSpecific something religious but then if they if these buildings will have a roof and that wouldn't have been possible\nSo so ... or ...\nDifferent things and ... but this is like I don't know this is highly controversial because al ... and and\nEnter apologies and and different type of experts around the world also have a a an approach and theories\nYeah so I asked us for us in the idea is to do to understand the academic troll approach or in understand in more um\n[noise] more uh I I I wouldn't say like saint saint ... maybe like rush 'em out like from the point of view a freshman holiday like functionality of the of the of the rooms of the buildings of they'd be serious you know off the site\nAnd yeah so speaking of functionality when you know if you were to go there today and sort of walk around you know what exactly do you see I mean and how what does it compare to walking around a town like uh in in\nThe sort of the modern world is that like all the schools over there you know there's an office over the ... you know this is where people live this is where people shop this is the marketplace\nWell so we have some some mother said you can do that almost that we'd be are\nOh yeah really okay yeah you're going to end that's on the website yeah yeah okay [laughter] yeah you can\nWeed vi and you can you can take a some sort of a muted food\nAnd it to be it is for people to get up like best because before I think that there's a lot of the like these and you had to you had to walk I like about two hours\nOr so you can walk two hours from or the or the from the time\nThere's a lot of them but used to be like the only way to get there for a while because of the storm rings in certain seasons the only way to get there wasn't by taking a walk in the country and that was how I did it\nBut that's how the Incas we're traveling for centuries the\nAdults who wants to [laughter] know yeah they were drawn their son [laughter] ... ... and strong [laughter] it's like they would always faster than MIT [laughter]\nThe question also it's important to consider that up is is very likely than metro ... was a ceremonial ... a ... century\nSo did type of the buildings and the type of ... do you find there um it was a descendants stopped around that idea of being a ceremony site so\n... if you find something to grow into an after school or or a write in modern concepts are probably they have certain equivalent they're\nConstrained by day do you have the ... century CD or they're like also um I I still am I said before they are so many theories around these coming from different\nUm the siblings and there's not like a strong agreement about what what's the use of the much beat you sort of got city if was a hundred percent ceremonial it was an income residents for the for the for the income so they ain't got is the head of the sky by here [noise]\nUm so it is a it is sealed part of the debate and certainly these type of studies will contribute\nTo cry fire or to a more arguments to these discussions\nAnd in in terms of the ... culture um what\nKnow we talked a lot about it the spiritual significance of the sites [noise] um and the fact that I might have been a sanctuary so what we're\nAnd ... and let the American Native American elites in ah the ah been rated the sun is one of the eighties or the mother um the the earth and Mother Earth less than important to eighty so I Would ... the the\nThe Native American or religious beliefs where around the sun and my Mother Earth\nAnd um that it is something that was also part of the ink a religious belief view of the world\nUm and that's why I'm there are certain significance of around the pool which are much would be to one of the theories is that much to a\nCD see ... constructing the shape of a U.S a certain ... and ... which was the capital I'm thinking part is shaping it in the tip of a ... so\nThese animals were strongly related to certain beliefs about ah the dates up the the the son and my mother\nAnd later with they are beginning plants in Hispanic conquerors um these beliefs as in many other countries in Latin America has been blended\nAre you still can find all these traditional Native American beliefs mixed with the ...

Australian\nOh that that's because we're not [laughter]\nReally yeah the uh it it started off as a as a joke all year ago are are are labeled lunch wakes you asked for a press release and they uh\nWe spent as a joke thinking that dinner right back this over the top claim that were from Melbourne but then they just posted it on the Internet just decided to have its way with that yeah because it's way more interesting yeah it's much much thing to being in Texas\nI still yeah and I thought you guys were originally from Austin when I played some of your older stuff that's what it used to say and I used to say that but now you know everything's on band camp and it says Melbourne and I'm I'm kinda fixated on Melbourne, Australia anyway so so\nWe can keep say we can we can live to you if you want\nWell but you got to work the accent so and and ...\n... ... we only know lines from Mad Max movies\nOkay great and and I don't know how we're going to be discussing the the the vibrant scene in Melbourne right now since you're not from Melbourne but anyway\nWe can talk you know death wish\n[laughter] so where are you right now I Know you're on tour\nOf ... where in Detroit rocks day that's

war to non it's the first one that I ever played from you guys I'm kind of late to the party\nAnd it has as our listeners will see in the listeners who've been listening to me play the new record\nThe new one has a different sound so so explain or if you will that that a transition that you've made new record is is it's not a departure is much just sounds a lot cleaner and different what were you thinking about\n... ... is a good ... yeah [laughter]\nUm do you want to talk about the Melbourne punk scene again [laughter]\nUm yeah I think we just figure that people might actually listen to this one so we decided to try and hunt\n[laughter] ... what do you have a defining producer or anything like that\nAbout to say we we recorded with the same exact same studio re did worry wart and I'm getting run bill could spray paint and yeah we we kind of we had a couple new tactics for this one like playing the vocal through PA instead of just straight into the mix\nAnd then putting a microphone away from the ... yeah Trump decides that I take a it was just like ... like production wise it was more of just like songwriting maybe changing and then\nWe have new um sarcasm you at ... and that's about the ... that's going to take different I think he had also had like there's like a couple of years in between according to the end just got a lot yeah it was like about two and a half years in between those recordings so I think and got a lot of uh a lot more equipment maybe\nOkay for the quick but I'm not really sure I don't think we really know even people that we used to play with in ah Austin I mean no boy a would say that like that like\nI got older I just looked up\nBut he liked you stopped at like they just start like that what you're talking about earlier than that I don't know okay\nWell let's see if we can um uh illustrate for their perceived shift I'm going to play a song and actually we played a lead tracks from a prayer for war which is your new will be\nOn

free press and with most federal Saudi Arabia runs a healing justice in the conversation project import those people call to step up\nYou're talking about the importance of these conversations and then there is the matter of creating and maintaining the space in which to have those conversations and there's where the technology can come in you know so I wanted to ask you about these portable network kits that you also work with\nRate so part of the project and my understanding of both community technology as well as the just transition for for the call means that our communities also need to have access to the infrastructure\nI think it's one thing to say you know we're going to push the FCC and the telecoms to do the right thing\nThat's another whole other projects to validate people's self determination by the ownership and governance of their infrastructure and so in a ... situation these things are very very difficult and so the conversations that I've been having with people there is like what technology is available that can support a lot of these\nFor the popped up I think there's maybe eleven or twelve of them that popped up\nImmediately after the storms to do everything from feeding people to health services acupuncture I mean you name it they've been doing that work and they continue to do that work one year past hurricanes so in my conversation with some of these folks it seems like they were looking for a technology that could be\nMaintained and governed by communities have local usage than what I mean by that is\nThat an Internet fails this technology the portable network we started using here in New York City through there was some way the project which is the project I was mentioning before where we have five communities that are building their own local networks so we produce these portable network cats and they were initially just to be used as a repair kit for our\nNetworks that are here but we realized that they had to use an emergency situations are portable because they have some additional security measures\nThey're affordable a small one could be a little three hundred dollars and they have different kinds of resiliency teachers including you came power them through a solar panels and battery packs so there's just a variety of ways in which there they don't really really useful so we did the training with one of the cams and some doors that weeks ago\nCalled old and you get all they're doing ... said again a variety of things from feeding people to self defense classes to Italy is he planning and so they invited us down with myself and some colleagues meaning technologist\nColleagues from the point which is one of the community organizations that's building the network in the ... section of the Bronx they came with their digital stewards a digital stores is the name that we use for a community residents were trained in building maintaining\nI'm running the networks are doing is sharing again local governance and control\nUntil we built a small\nLocal network there in ...\nCan work with the Internet so it can help to share the Internet to different sites but it also can function as local network without the ... pass\nSomething called island mode to people can continue to communicate with each other and a local space and fun file each other videos\nPhotos just communicate basically [laughter] you know when everything goes down and so this is a really important tool that she'll come for the call are interested in using and so we've been working folks there for excited about that work and\nAlso trying to support the ongoing work of the mutual aid centers throughout the island\nWell the power of course of these very local and sort of direct people to people communications goes well beyond the fact that they can\nContinue to function even in times of environmental catastrophe it's also what they get to say we saw a spate of stories after Maria about what you call this mutual aid we heard about communities working together to clear the roads and to fix houses in the absence of\nSupport from the state\nBut it's very evocative to think about applying that mutual aid ethic to communications you know there's a sense as a media critic you always get the sense that you're supposed to win the media you know that social justice organization stopped when the media and that's the way to speak to the people in order to change things\nBut this is a way of\nWorking around and without\nElite media in order to tell stories that need to be told\nExactly it's like focus on central as technologies which is you know movement out across the world this is not a new thing but it's a movement to really support\nSelf governance and a place like ... colonialism is the rule and a very brutal form of colonialism manual liberalism that is impacting our people even after hurricane now they're trying to put all sorts of awful privatization\nRelationship writes it was really trying to shift that narrative away from that to wind of\nAgain self governance community control again not things that are new but really trying to utilize existing technologies that are affordable as a way to support that very basic human right towards self determination\nWell I I wanted to ask about that in particular the relationship between the U.S government Puerto Rico wasn't reflected of course only an agency foot dragging and the the curtain was pulled off a the the new year of it you know the arrogance of that relationship with that image of Donald Trump tossing\nFreaking paper towels to people at an aid distribution center if there were any mystery to it I think it should be removed but all of which is just to say that taking control of the narrative and being able to subvert imagery that's pervasive that means particular things for Puerto Ricans\nDefinitely absolutely certainly the narrative of dependency the narrative that the federal government was putting forward that somehow we are to blame for the mystery that colonialism causes\nThat are people they locked gratitude for the work that was being done\nWhen actually things we're not getting that we bring getting food we've aren't even getting tarts most of the tarps ended up on the island\nCame because people ... sent them there so there was a huge failure on the local and federal government level and if you write it absolutely did reveal that the mask of colonialism the brutality of it unfortunately I seems that a lot of the media has not learned that lesson and so\nContinues to promote a narrative of dependency of paternal Islam and doesn't recognize the amazing work that\nPeople are doing to help each other to support each other and that's what I saw when I was in ... you know community is very impacted\nAlso by poverty ongoing poverty\nHave been supporting and doing what they can to help each other out throughout but I think at this moment because of hurricane there's an opportunity to shift that narrative there's an opportunity to shift resources to shift\nUnderstandings of what the relationship is between for the call and the United states and for the rest of the world and so I'm hopeful and also incredibly inspired by the people that I met that I spoke with who share their stories who are\nWorking in their localities to promote these ideas are off off the termination because the process of the conversation is a long process but it's one that has to be at the forefront of any conversation whether it's communications food sovereignty whatever it is that's at the root of the issue\nWe've been speaking with today's ... director of resilience just technologies thank you so much for joining us this week on the counter spend\nThank you so much for having me [noise]\nSecond Monday of October has passed and listeners may have noticed that there was last in fourteen hundred and Ninety to Columbus sale the ocean blue than they might remember from the past\nMore and more cities states in colleges have officially changed the day's name to indigenous people's day and acknowledgement that Columbus his legacy of mass murder rape invasion and enslavement is nothing to celebrate\nChallenging the glorification of someone who did such horrific harm is welcome but changing the name of the holiday might give some the impression that that harm which is ongoing has been addressed and that would be just on true but unhelpful our next guest is among those\nStay a completed intervention\nAm Russ alone is a writer educator and community builder she's a doctoral candidate
