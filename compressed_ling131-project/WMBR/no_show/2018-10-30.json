get together and share a big country dinner\nI'll Try for it I Will stay on our food and when I play\nI was a happy kid\nFeeling isolated\nOur parents were good to me and the expensively surrounding land consistently kept my explorer tendencies busy [noise]\nAs I stated we lived off a single lane road\nBehind our ranch style house where the cornfield\nRows and rows of stocks that reached out and touch the horizon\nOften worried about getting lost in the Korean labyrinth whenever I had to go fetch dad for suffered a tight stocks towering over\nIn front of the house with a vast stretch a flat

of colors and human form [noise] I Do for my back [noise]\nSolutions of bravery shattered in an instant\nNow Doug myself deep into the covers [noise]\nAnd feeling like I had just seen something I wasn't supposed to [noise]\nThe next day the house was gone again part of me was a little glass\nBecause it gave my young mind time\nItself around what it has seen\nI kept replaying it over and over again my imagination giving the human shape the blurred details and features but whatever images that conjured sooner race by the reality of my memory\nAnd that reality was\nI had no clue what I had seen I my breakfast in the kitchen\nListening to my parents talked about the day's plans my ears perked up when my mom told me we were having to Harvey is over for supper I Would finally be able to tell Trevor about everything\nAnd a couple of by my father said he didn't need my help today and so after I helped mom with the dishes sprinted out the front door towards the wood but the house gone [noise]\nLike just another wonderful summer day bursting with early morning possibility\nShould I be able to afford maybe launch Trevor got here we could play Lewis and Clark\nWhooping and hollering my feet took me across the grassy fields towards the tree lined\nUp past the spot where the mysterious greenhouse headset\nWondered what would happen if it's suddenly appears with me running over by\nOr would I be flying high into the sky as it came rocketing out of\nFeeling suddenly nervous I put on an extra bit of speed and passed over where it had arrested\nToday passed in a blur\nAnd summer heat\nI spent most of it's splashing around one of those strains\nRocks and pretending I was fighting Indian [noise]\nIt was one of those days that shapes how I look\nEverything seemed ...\nDe make believe fan and venture [noise]\nLast myself and whatever fiction I was an acting\nThoughts as a house faded further\nAway and the growing cheap\nSon climbed into a blistering climax than began to slow to send dipping towards the horizon\nOut in a pool of color\nMelting popsicle\nNot realizing how late it had gotten\nNow somehow hungry I was a through the last\nThe parents had shown up yet [noise]\nI looked up and to this guy\nTrying to gauge what time it was all the way my stomach was rumbling had better be time to eat [noise]\nI'm broke through the tree line and was about to sprint the rest of the way when to stop\nThe house was back except something was different [noise] the house was facing me\nI felt unease creep across the ground and climb up my legs [noise] this one is that right [noise] it was supposed to be facing my house why was it like this now\nSwallowed hard my own house now blocked from site to watch the windows dark and empty looking for signs of life\nLooking for signs of the thing in the storm\nIt was motionless\nI began to make my way around it in a wide circle keeping my\nEyes on the front door as I Walk I kept expecting it to burst open and some creature come charging at me but it didn't nothing move getting halfway around I made a break from my front porch my legs kicked through the knee high grass\nShoes dating into the soft or says I wrecked my eyes away and focused on my destination [noise] painting that climbed up the steps sucking in lung fools of evening air\nI turned around and almost fell over the house was\nBacked facing mine [noise] there for a moment\nSucking air\nWaited for something to happen in my mind\nThe house with a lot of some kind of living beasts that launched me\nDangerous turning away I went inside I was greeted with a savory aroma gentle heat filling the air with mouth watering smells\nHer commotion in the kitchen along with the rolling laughter\nOf conversation\nI walked into the dining room and was greeted from the stove by my lover\nWho informed me had caps Trevor waiting\nI said my mother pillows to traverse parents whose smiled and return migrating before returning to the conversation with my parents had interrupted\nI went to the bathroom to wash up\nFollowed by Trevor who was excited they telling me about a forty had been building in the woods by his house\nI shared with him my adventures of the day and together we began to make plans to sleep over at each other's homes with hopes that tonight would be one of those not as I dragged my hands\nAsked him if he noticed anything on his way to my house she looked confused\nAnd so I let him down the hall to the front door\nI opened it and pointed to the green house with the yellow shutters\nAsked him if he could see\nHe chuckle and slapped me on the back saying of course he could\nReally washed over me and closing the door behind us stepping out onto the porch I began to share with him a strange experiences with the house in the field\nHis ads grew why the smile split his face and a half\nThe longer I talked to more I saw his eyes light up\nHe asked me if I had explored it yet more poked around the outside to see if I could get inside\nI shook my head violently expressing the feeling of fear it admitted\nBeen watching me in the storm\nList only egg him on\nSparking his enthusiasm to explore\nAs I tried to talk him out of it\nI heard my father call me set the table\nTrevor helped me so the water glasses and soon we were sitting around a table so steaming food [noise]\nI didn't care about the banquet in front of me\nIt was just an obstacle to Trevor\nDisregarding the hardware that went into the preparation\nDug in with a vengeance after my father said grace\nAnother shot meal agree to add a proceeded to stuff my face pounding the food down with mouthful water\nAcross the table and saw Trevor was at the same mindset\nI waited the appropriate amount of time\nAs soon as the thought crossed my mind\nI didn't want to be thinking about that when it was this dark and everything was so silent [noise]\nSomething was drawing me to the window though I could almost feel physical pool tourists that Golding me to go to it [noise] I resisted at first but knew I wasn't going to be able to fall back asleep until I had done so\nSlipped out of bed\nBeing careful not to step on Travers hadn't I tip toe towards my window\nAnd felt dress begin to rise\nMind repeatedly begged me to go back to my covers\nOver and over the thought ripple through my mind\nDon't look don't look don't look I reached the window\nMy heart was awhile drumbeat in my chest and I felt myself for sick with got slamming fear\nTo this day thinking about what I saw that night fills me with over\nEnding where it all in the\nAnd silent but

listening to WNPR in Cambridge\nOoh this is exist engine I'm Noah Muskie welcome to the show\nAnd smell the league or the medal of folks were in the middle the midst of an epic proportion Mary event in humankind is the middle of a semester or my world is on fire how 'bout yours it's the way I like it I never get bored so you're listening to music tonight\nOr get ready and simultaneously feel like this semester is going at a at a peace approaching a light speed but I also feel like I Can't get done with sooner it's a weird or it's a weird mix for the fact that it's October\nThirtieth or know blows my mind is like people\nThat make them interacting with the whole semester that on one side of feel like I just kinda met any other like they know me so well in this weird ducks religion I'm Still trying to get over\nBut anyway\nIn terms of getting to know people something I've been thinking about race\nIt is to know about a person and that and I think that would seem to make sense like you've experienced more things in life you've had more time to ponder over ideas and develop some sort of like complex personality\nWhich would mean that as time goes on like one unit of time\nIs like a a in an increasingly inefficient a ways to get to know someone that is to say it is harder to get to understand someone you know\nAll everything else equal ... or the\nLonger that you live ... would you agree with that\nI think that it's definitely easier as a child to make friends are and like when I knew ... people but I wouldn't necessarily say that that's something that those who are illiterate half your life I have a hard time doing um\nWhat's what's your reasoning necessarily for why someone who's been around longer can have more difficulty understanding you know the person\nIt's not that it's harder to understand someone but just that it takes more time to understand you know\nSome fix proportion about them I C\nWhich is like a very like mathematical and like quantified way of approaching something which is incredibly on quantifiable yeah like what does it mean to understand a person you know can you can actually be measured to any Nick valuable degree\nIt's quite possible the answer is no [laughter] [laughter] and and that this is a completely worthless no mental exercise\nI don't think that's necessarily the case I was hoping you know [laughter] that's because uh I'm old and old people understand people because they've been around long enough\nUm which is a thing or [laughter] I Would say that you have more experience in the field of people ... and you can relate to a wider audience\n\nMy are completely worthless example here is that a lot of politicians happened to be pretty old real people and uh and the politicians have to go on with a lot of people so I think about that I think without food for thought\nI Would agree with that however I Would counter that by saying the older you get\nThe more and more of an earlier in the more entrenched you tend to be in your beliefs that is true which would suggest to me that well yes you are kind of better at navigating the world of people\nYou are less well equipped to be changed by people ... perhaps being able to understand them better\n[noise] I see this kind of sad actually\nYeah I I think it's an interesting trick a trade off\nYeah [laughter] so\nDo you just like to have more reasons that like people [laughter] that is like oh boy I I've lived long enough to do that people terrible terrible I in\nMy in my long in many Twenty years I have come to the inevitable conclusion that does not worth knowing people\nPeople conflict though right why do people know that conflicting doesn't always lead to me OK so on one side and we all as we all know like raising concerns about the actions of a person can stop them from being an evil actor in whatever situation and then there for like ... that's good [laughter]\n[laughter] but like why does or why is there a modern concepts\nOh it's because you're redistributing things into more equitable way why McLean of political theory hum\nBut things are becoming more equitable as a result of conflict like does it mean that were destined to like have conflict until things equitable and who decides who decides what's equitable I don't know the answer to that but I like music\nAs do I and if you're still listening we hope you do to [laughter] it's a nerd\nOur job\nTo stage ... that's a quote from my early childhood [noise]\n\n\n\n\nOn both sides have or advise and the governments and had these like large conversation you had these ... large conversations about their effect on the outcome of the conflict um like which experts you trust which experts have good opinions\nI think that'll come across some interesting points I outline here on my laptop and I are talking about how um\nIndividuals themselves didn't always pressure media or government to question itself on matters of foreign policy\nBecause of lack of knowledge on the subject the media and government or not those who were forced to fight these wars in the middle east and the U.S have a large dependence on so called in self determined experts\nMhm [noise]\nAnd I just kind of feel like okay like y'all got to have more checks and balances balances internal yourself 'cause like who said that like kind of something silly to say but who watches the government like who is in charge of the government like who makes sure the government's doing anything\nRight and if you're doing urban planning you're going to be part of the public sector probably\nAh yeah at least I'll be interacting with\nIt in some form of factor mhm uh and so how do you know as like a zoning officer that what you're doing the right thing how do you know\nHow you know you're just about to this place like hundreds of people and ruin lives how you know that that child who's going to live and grow up and then they bred is not going to go and go somewhere else that's you know can be bad for them\nYou know\n... that's why we have experts right and people who say these sorts of things are ... those are a lot of questions\nYeah yeah well when you talked about looking at the government has reminded of or when the first or when the current um\nA state house or a sir at city hall was built in New York City or a number of media agencies like the original building for the New York times was built right across the street for them in this big towering bills and that kind of looked over government you know and and the just the designing and building communicated this ... it's like\nBullock philosophy of like the media are being responsible for you\nKnow the ongoing of government was literally built into the various kinds of the of the city\nI should have had like two big eyes [laughter] on the top of the building and it's like a luxury apartment or something now of course oh how the times change ... let's go out there who have a lot of money you know yeah I I was just reading about Vancouver like [noise]\nLike now you say they go with the ... what why you mentioned Vancouver for the average listener who will not aware honestly like a a friend just lounge or should I should be an article about like the influx of money a foreign money into Vancouver which I had no idea simply what foreign money a specific Chinese my\n[laughter] like over the last ten years or so a Vancouver as in incredible increases in a housing prices are private\nProperty development ah for example that there is some ridiculous like things that like for\nLike like the median income for ... for students is like zero because people don't have jobs yeah but nevertheless they are owning multimillion dollar properties because their parents are buying like luxury condos and apartments and yep\nLike\nAre so many people in that city who does live there and they don't work like that like there is like\nA complete lack of jobs for regular people in that city yep because so much of the housing is for people of absurd well\nWhat does that mean for the future of the city it's out of control I mean it's ... it can't go on forever and the candidates like making attempts to to limit the influx of foreign money and they're cracking down on money laundering they're working at\nOr is going to be really hard to come back you know and and to protect homes from losing value that quickly to protect the city from aggressive disinvestment it's it's going to be very dangerous\nIt's kinda weird 'cause like the people who have been brought to spy on themselves because too many people wanted it right that's the problem as far as I Know\nYeah and and similar things are happening in a lot of American cities particularly New York San Francisco Los Angeles\nYeah which I can say like oh these big cultural hubs and so all these like foreign investors are like oh I Need like a condo in the city and then when everyone has when it's like oh wait just ruined the city [laughter]\nKind of like popped it up like a big building and then like when everyone tried to jump in it popped and so housing markets gone but everyone who is considered the cultural part of the city's stopping lap because they can't live there anymore you know if this is kind of like husk ... Vancouver\nYeah I'm I'm scared what's gonna happen a but\nIn well well it kind of like [laughter] that's the only way I'm old people who have tried to jump in and buy it by these big big expensive homes are the kind of like wasting their money is ... ... where's that money going it's going to like\nMiddle class property owners it's going to like real estate developers right ... ... which are also probably rich people\nAlso wealthy people I mean it's it's an investment in in Vancouver least it's not a very worthwhile investment\nYeah I'm dying over here is ... ... [laughter] I think music music would give the man when he was a [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThe\n\n\nThe\nHe\n\n...\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nMore\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] you know [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhat do you call a crab when their show\nI don't know\nCaught a slug oh either going to say like ... or ... one of those like really bad puns [laughter]\nI bet you beat me there [laughter] it was pretty good shell shocked plus ... that's got to get really a moral support to get through this homework\nOh man I'm disappointed with myself now disappointing why it was a good one it was good\nActually you know I I Do really love plans there there's a great book called the sun also rises uh I forget the officers' names will look it up mhm\nUh he won\nThe ah John potluck\nJohn pollock a number of years ago he won like the national like pine championships which is like an annual event in Minnesota somewhere what'd you have to like party line by yes it's it's just incredible\nYou know you know shoot out of these dueling pun puns through a broad is who you know in seconds flat pull out you know their full arsenal of of plans and I I imagine it must be just fantastic to watch\nI Would hope so\nYeah it is the key details how no puns have had their\nThis is the intellectual form of humor as they once were\nIntellectual form of humor yeah what does that mean\nPuns used to be shown as they used to be a form of wet you know if if you could create a clever upon you know these are things that were exchanged in colonial coffee shops and no primordial Boston\nYou know you would go go down to the local cafe ... and you know have these like battles of wet and you know puns where these ways to show just how like linguistically talented you were and know how many how diversity a vocabulary in your education was\nA and they weren't no these shield jokes it was for the upper ... rate you know ... you know ... it was kinda like the rap battles of\nThomas Jefferson and in in company\nI see the rap battles of the time ... and company T. M.\nIncorporated exactly exactly\nYeah and uh I Know I I think it'd be kinda nice to have that oh I I Would love to walk into a local cafe in ... myself beside someone who's just waiting to just through their their best at me\nFor best pardon yeah [laughter]\nI was just talking off the record about how I Wish there was a sort of weird working bistro setting somewhere nearby that was open like a ... set of ours like two am today um\nAnd it would have a very surreal is atmosphere and it would have a very bright lights and very strong coffee near the goal of just kind of be like fight your skating with them\nMhm I Know it was weird idea\nI I've always been convinced in in ...\nPizza joint near campus it would make a killing\nEach other because the food and the caffeine options at this time of the night and on worried when people are still working are quite limited constructed to like one place I think we both know yeah it is and if I had another option I I can tell you I Would I Would take it\nYeah I think the people who control the only option control because they're going to do first of all it was like a system in place that have employees into our but [laughter] uh in one way or not\nThey kind of like assume that role ... and ... they probably are some very much as as soon as it was kinda forced thrust upon them but you know what I'm saying I think helps at least\nYeah Boston and Cambridge are strange though I Know that there is such a lack of nightlife ... which is larger than friendly 'cause of city codes I holding it was just doesn't line up with I don't like the\nWhat is what does city cutters code in the ... are they like C. plus plus cutters\nTechnology has gone too far [laughter] has going to do for almost a\nYear who knows what Wendy let me will be robots rating the seafood [noise] there's actually already a AI attorneys in a sense like I I think someone at Stanford maybe a wrote a bought to review it\nA very standard like traffic court cases ... and it ended up being the surprisingly effective that's kinda scary but it but it's I I think in those sorts of situations is actually kind of incredible how you can train something to advocate for for people yeah I mean like\nI shall intelligence ... correspondence between themselves and they have a court\nThat's kind of weird like\nI Would assume that all matters of legal like all legal matters are completely in the control of individuals in human beings\nBut the fact that someone can like off the outsourced they're they're intellect to like artificial intelligence to go and write the emails to like or county clerk and be like you know I don't deserve this time I was only parking there 'cause my wife was like ... in the hospital next door and we're having our first child\nAnd all that jazz um\nYeah but still I feel like the the individuals should be the only person you can explore that corresponds ...\n[laughter] it's kinda weird I don't know how I feel about that [laughter]\nAnd I and\nI'm I'm just imagining a a day where you have like a a fender bender between your in someone else's autonomy his car and then your economist cars you know settle it in a ... times\nAnd I was like ... it's the it's the negligent parties are not humans then you know perhaps it ought to be the case that the the judge jury\nAre also non human you understand it was so you sound right though [laughter] I\nI'm a say in this way so much intentionally or\n... if you'd like to rock them sock 'em robots like fight over like a road rage cave that that's I think all my life will be complete like hope hope program you are on the up and out after it was when that happens [noise] big breakthrough for all the fish when you're like a\nCompletely absurd but I mean there are things that we do on a daily basis today that you know seem farfetched and Cy Cy like [laughter] even\nIt's like every other day I think about this and the reading frame of\nTo cell phones like I'll find myself holding my cell phone every now and then like intentionally kind of like a child like hold on to like their parents finger and like I'm so reliant on this device if I just talked to him to

so my uh my wife and kids know me and the although they're going to be as book too\nYou wouldn't want me to call you Donald though you could you know I got the buck hat on but it's also in that case yeah you ... ... [laughter] it's so dangerous that were on the street\nYeah I'm not accusing you of anything in particular that I assure you if I'm\nRather a rather broad minded when it comes to politics\nNo good for you it's good you know you once said in print that your name or not the given name originally but you're a pseudonym was a pain in the ass but you were the only one out of blue ice\nIt's not really a pain that's just sort of inconvenient you wind up putting both names down anyway and you know it's a little confusing sometimes if you're ... 'cause like you go to the should I call you a buck or should I call you\nOn which I just did a ride with you so is it in total is it Donald buck Dharma Rosen is that burrows arose or sorry do you write that down for names in a row\nNo oh when I'm Out ...\nOh okay okay sorry to a stress that we can move on now [laughter] yeah [laughter] and all that I think we've covered that a few weeks ago I interviewed Neal's Lofgren who played accordion are starting at age five he played it for ten years and I did read that you play the accordion too as a youth\nI did I get my dad's suggested that 'cause I was always a little fellow I'm short stature I'm no he thought that way probably couldn't afford a piano but he thought that\nI should learn an instrument at some point when I was nine years old I played according\nMhm that's rather an unusual instrument why do I keep coming into a onto rock stars who [laughter] go that route string I\nThink you know first for people of a certain age and historical period the accordion was sort of popular\nOh and why would that be do you think\nUm because they were recording artist the political party and the accordion were electrified around the time of the late fifties sixties so they were allowed enough to be in a in a band and\nYou know it wasn't really looked down upon the sole rock really took over\n... until the entire ... chicken charges killed accordion in soon but claimed accordion\nOf course in and the other instruments took over for you as well right\nRight yeah Billy Joel was recorded styles he was a lot of people don't\nSpeaking of that you were in a couple of bands in high school right\nI was in a surf banned it in high school yeah name of the monitor raised ... after the merger after the automobile oh sure I mean we only played about five shows were really happening commercial entity\nDo I have to ask you if you were at all influenced by the Beatles\nA totally yeah build on it so much you talk to just about anybody who has done music in the last fifty years from the loss it it's almost universal\nThat's why I said you have to ask you because a lot of my talk a lot of you rockers who of course words kind of a um landmark her touchstone for everybody but were there were other bands that you were particularly fond of the time\nI think the thing with the Beatles is you know I mean I looked at all of us personally when I was a kitten and I and I never thought that I could be up especially when I saw the Beatles I said you know I think I could do is\nEspecially when you've got three other people around you for support Elvis didn't ... right right right uh jokes good point yeah\nYeah well he did have Scotty more in other musicians there with them but uh that's that's not how we appear to others seem like just you know the God and yes\nYes as a as a total mess right Johnny Was unique and the low\n\n\nWay I mean\nWith\n\n\n\n\nWell you also oh both of them the lyrical matter of the early materials some a little bit later as well\nCertainly the like the underbelly I'm cool\nFrom a totally other access was was a complement to\nWho's lyrics are these I took it from an early software underbelly song and you do know of course that your early Electra material from areas up on YouTube I Hope you do\nUm yeah I guess so you know we thought those recordings are gone but then ... came out with him about some time in the nineties I think yeah I thought the tapes are bound up in a landfill somewhere but I'm Glad that they exist\nWell that's the stock forest group that's that's the material that rhino handmade put out but I'm Talking about even earlier stuff from South wait until\nThe last ... stuff\nUh yeah a real psychedelic and here's like here's some early lyrics you vomit slime my arm pits rhyme like artichoke hearts not our own hearts I mean who is that which one of those guys who they're you know that's\nYeah that's a song called bark and the sun goes up on the one that's Richard ... of course anyone right stuff like\nThat you can find that on line as well yeah well that's good I'm Glad it's all up to the Internet's wonderful\nIt is and will we ever see that released are probably not the quality isn't the best\nYeah it's probably a it's probably be a double up but I don't even know who's putting their stuff up\nRight right right well let's get to the early lives of software underbelly and stopped forest group as far as this\nWeird ruler ... for the new law [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThe early lives of software underbelly and stock forest group as far as this weird roller coaster time in which you were courting a couple of labels electric in Colombia and I never quite red such a\nSuch a strange up and down experience with labels at the beginning to remember how it worked out there or how it started and then what happened\nWell yeah because Sandy you know I had this this uh last or with a record company she could get them all the time um companies studios we did a demo from mercury it did I auditioned for a lecture and then did a a a demo out of that before we got signed and also\nColombia at that time and why did we we didn't get sound at that time in Columbia but the electorate eventually did science and with less Bernstein has vocalist because they\nThought they saw in and Wes sort of an east coaster mind I thought that lesson some kind of a or about it\nAnd when I listen to the original a soft underbelly tapes I didn't think he had the greatest voice live but must have been his appearance\nBut yeah I mean he had this dramatic sense that uh was was effective in live performance\nPlus there was a friend of ... is the brother Peter yellow and he had gotten a one of the songs that he had written recorded by Peter Paul Mary so so less already thought of himself as a professional in that regard\nMore so than the rest of you but we would never done it\nSo why did ah Columbia eventually and probably not long after you hooked up with them why did they drop your shelves your album\nWasn't Columbia oh was elected as\nYeah um I think the label had a falling out with it at some point\nThey had signed us and then we made a record with less and less left the ban without satisfactory recording vocals you know and we've kind of cast around we got Iraq as a singer and then they they you know Eric what's not last and\nThey went for another round up recording we drop out to California and did the second round up recordings with the Eric sent eight and a at some point they just you know decided really just too much of a pain in the accident that called the plug\nThere were two versions of the stock for some material on the rhino handmade release one from Seventy and one from a bit later and are there different vocal listening I didn't hear a large difference between the two\nIf you hear it you know it's you know it sounds like in your last you know what he said it was like I mean it's not it's not going to mistake\nYeah and I'm I'm not even sure if the tapes on your rhino records were the best versions of getting because obviously we couldn't carry that stuff ourselves we we have no idea where any of that stuff was it a lecture I'd been in Salt twice\nOn the physical or assets of the tapes themselves we didn't know where they were ... you know if anybody's looked at him with a year's so\nRight you happy I'm Glad\nYeah I'm I'm Glad that some of it exists even if it wasn't the best stuff the stuff that we attend it\nSold out of course now [laughter] that particular released\nYeah otherwise it's at this point in my music consumption personally I I don't even have a CD player\nSo I I ... yeah I mean I have to put a CD and my uh in my DVD player if I Want to hear it right so I Try to go to my car [laughter] even my even my laptop does not uh the uh the disc drive anymore some cars don't me STD now after like what\nThey did anyway that's a whole long story and which to me I still have about\nTwelve feet is oh geez I got about ... thousand days that are in boxes of moved twice without even an actor\nThat hurts [laughter] yeah\nNo I mean I'd I'd rather just go to the big bucks in the cloud and say\nWell I think a buck was a little confused on the two versions of the stock force group\nRecordings that came out and rhino handmade they both are the same book list I'm assuming that's Eric Bloom and not less Bronx the Bronx dean not sure\nSo you know very confusing at that time anyway let's hear something from the original version actually they uh no this is well I get confused myself I think they were called ... for a very brief time when they recorded\nThis version of a fact about sneakers\nSaying\nA\n\n\nNah\nI heard you called different things I think I'm just curious about your opinion of some someone mentioned your son being heavy harm like queen although I don't think you're quite the trickle biker boogie right among said the steely Dan of hard rock does any of this makes sense you\nKnow there's just I just got a book or probably more like ... it's\nReally if that means\nIt will it it does I Know the arcade fire sound\nAnd but I mean just the way that they would do any you know if it's something to get into their head they would do it\nOh I see yeah I'm not a ... [laughter]\nYeah I mean we we were never really self conscious about the way we approached arrangements are right here if we liked it we'd been\nPre magazine love you guys from the beginning yeah\nI think there was a little biased on the part of the critics out there just because the Indian and Richard where or one of them you know mhm we probably got a break but uh other than that yeah I mean it was good stuff\nRight and uh they were Detroit magazine and you know MC five very close to them but I just I mentioned this with them in a few weeks back uh yeah I Am the fibers signed with electric thanks I Know that's right right right but they hated it so I could tell you [laughter] you ... yeah right\nYeah Well Jerry Garcia is one of my biggest some you know like like quick so we're like a like airplane you know like all those parents\nI Do too and were you at what was called the dead hat or although that wasn't quite a a thing in the sixties yet\nWell we like the records you know but uh we we weren't following them around because we were doing\n[noise] um\n[noise] I'm\nAnd\nAnd now\nGuardian or\nMan in line with\nThen\nThere\nAre people\n\n\n\n\nUm\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of that actually what was your first tour once you kind of made a little name for yourself\nWell the first thing we did after the the lowest your coat record was released it certainly was was a beautiful dog Seventy two was\nWinter chore of New England in college or the purge headlined was the birds with the white boys and then and then ...\nYeah I Would be a way to end it because they were so loud darn\nYeah and there were very good to know they were and the birds are out on the college kids did not understand\nOr just jaw dropping like good every night and\nThen we had to follow him and then the birds getting on\nAnd it was the burns in their country a country yeah yeah thing but\nSome of the hits but that was a lot of the country's doctor\nWell they were about to be um removed from the public eye by bands like you [laughter] I think they are actually\nYou know we were at that point we we didn't have a goal records about Seventy four Seventy five oh yeah it was\nFour years for a real slog while we were creating the three job of our first three records you know which are you know well regarded to the state oh I think they're great and\nBut they weren't huge commercials successors ... federally more incremental am and to Columbia Records credit you know they didn't drop us after the first year when we sold a hundred thousand copies I Know they they opted for another record the attorney that's all two hundred thousand against the country's top three hundred thousand\nYou know in the in the year that's released in our school record which are on your feet are on these elaborate\nOh yes right God they hand today for some reason and it's just barely yeah I don't know why this\nIs a version of last man just killed\nSo you you're going to be very happy because I was going over the whole record you know I I reviewed meetings and I'm playing not from that record and I know that you're somewhere you know yeah\nThat's the only cut on that record that was it was mixed by Jack Douglass a guy who did a cheap trick and house and eat and get a really good job on that so that's part of the reason why that's so good [noise]\n\n\nAnd garlic I like\nI don't I Try I Try to provide them but I'm not sure I Know that they're going\nTo go on and I'm just trying to you know there are different than go for\nA long time\nTo\nPair of other things [laughter]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nAt two minutes after one o'clock [noise]\nYou've got a team to W. M. B. art in Cambridge back to the but Dharma interview\nYou say that those three albums by the way they called the black and white tree or\nBy ... by\nOh somebody somebody's met started this I guess because the word had black and white cover art on the front of the purse or you\nJust read it in there too [laughter] oh the newspaper tree like what little\nThere you go [laughter] um would you\nCall these three albums stylistically similar\n[noise] yes and what was that those dial\n[noise] you're asking me to explain it to where we were at um it was a fairly compressed time period because we were very busy Tory ... recording\nAnd it started out with the ... ... ... there was a pretty steady flow of struck me on the line from Sandy in rich\nOr you know personal development and all that stuff so by the time we got the age that was the O. J. ... up to ... ... ... ... ...\nWhat was the meaning of that to you\nIt just everybody bought either she or trucks were orders would admit to an old without the ... everybody could further arrange their material before which brought you the rest of the brain so there so long you know got\nA little war further down the road for the ...\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nAnd and it's All right all\nRight [laughter] and and\nAnd now\nAnd you know I'm not an animal\n[laughter] [laughter] [noise]\nI I don't I don't know [laughter]\n[laughter]\n\n[noise] [laughter]\nAnd they're\nAvailable\nAnd they may know why\n[laughter] [laughter]\nAnd and\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I Know they're delightful arrangement to a poem by a person a\nBand called [noise] ah ... new album\nOut didn't catch the name of the bomb that tracked typing buster dot com for likely listing from WNPR\nDuring the time span of the first three albums were did you eventually headlined your own tour\nAnd then we we always supported larger so we started going ... feel\nAny particular show that stands out for you that's probably comment question but I'm not gonna\nLet you know we can look\n[laughter]\nNothing amongst all of those I mean even pass the three albums throughout your career is there something that stands out as being maybe\nSpecial\nMom when we started headline every as it was it was pretty good you know as we ... a a show at the Capitol center and land though from Marilyn in the building even exist now but uh it was great the lasers were great period laser shows\nMhm which we got after a dumpster rip it was a hit\nThat was a whole greater\nCause the government and they just stopped doing that\nEverybody should have been a OSHA followed us around for about six the occupational safety hazard administration followed us around for about six weeks on tour\nUm I mean I don't know how you get there obviously if I did I did it but\n[laughter]\nYou know I mean I have to entertain myself that's that's my criteria I have to like my own plane so that's what drives me do quite a way I Do so\nWhen you look back at your albums do you think you were a successfully showcased an eight year playing a is what it should be a lot of people a lot of professional musicians look back and think about all the mistakes that they made\nYou know I'm OK with in six one of my favorite cuts is the Beatles twist and shout where there's a good ... third round and every time I hear a twist and shout I'd just waiting for that mistake [laughter] just ...\nIt really characterizes a bad I mean it allows the band to sound human and unfortunately today's commercial music sounds anything but human\nAh you'd make a good point I think one of the reasons why today's pop as\nWe used to me it's just kind of a void of a real ... says everything is ironed out on that it's all equal temperament pitch rhythms are all straightened out there's nothing added to you know it sounds really good\nWell I certainly know what you're saying but my fourteen year old would never know and she you know she's growing up with this stuff I Wish she understood\nAnd I wish she listened to some of the stuff I Can't I Can't even push it on her [laughter] it's really ... you know it's I managed to do with my first born I gave her the foundation but for some reason it's gotten so far more difficult to turn teenagers heads around I think but anyway\nYeah well we found that the sort of astonishing longevity adultery is because it's like it's not it doesn't sound stuff\nBut the kids are going to hear it on soundtracks and all that thank goodness\nYeah but they they seem to relate to it you know the way people am I yeah I you know I I think that's great\nYeah the younger ones they can say well I Know that song but they're not as excited about it is I Wish they would be ... ... ...\n[noise]\n\nThey don't see the ring with\n... we can be like the\n\n\nNa na na na na\nNa\nThe low meal or young\n... by the way\nAnd\n\n\nAnd\nHe he\n\n\nI'm\nMy\n\nUm which also curious about a boy circle is that you fellas had multiple songwriters and multiple leads vocalist\nAnd I'm Wondering if there were problems with that in much the same way that Crosby stills and Nash and young kind of fought over who was going to get a song on the album\nYeah we all think we all road and you know that probably made marketing imagery a little more difficult than somebody with a strong identifiable traced\nMhm but that's just the way it was sure that we all we all want to do it so we do it and it was\nSort of like just sort of a cooperative you know loose conglomerate desperate influences account\nThere's also like yeah like you know after the reports are still looking for a good show well\nNumber yeah yeah she was she was definitely there you know and the engine\nCarol was a friend of ours as well and explain to a gym Carol is for those who don't you wrote a book called the basketball diaries about his time in his twenties like admitted to a movie\nAnd uh he was an artist also recording artist mhm and um\nHe also wrote lyrics for us for water is what it is an ex\nBonnet just up on the subject of Patty I'm a shooting shark was alert that I found out years later in the eighties and wrote that song with Patti lyrics that was after Patty you know and it split up because she married a Fred sonic Smith from the MC five\nYup there's the MC five boys Tacoma and action again [laughter] yeah and\nShe had sort of retired from performing at that time I guess it was just raising your kids whatever\nOh yes and she came back after quite a period of time you know people have the power she came back with in fact you Carol how to a song that was almost a hit I don't know if it was just on FM radio but people who died that was him right yeah\nOh yeah that's an awesome so\nYeah it certainly is makes me want to play it for your special but I don't know it's time for that your songs are too long [laughter] have to get to as many of them as possible and then Michael Moore cock is the other name from outside that contribute him some below sea to\nBloom had had corresponded with Michael and Michael working at ... I guess are already in a so Eric and Michael ... songs for ... or B that really stands out and black late too yeah\n[noise] and he did much more for hock window I Believe and Robert ... I'm ... ... from that been but I just\nI just did a song called Howell lands on a new Michael Moore track record that's just coming out\nYeah that is cool for those who don't know by the way hawk when let me kill meister motor head\nFor those who don't know right right right so secret treaties and why am I going back to seek a treaty that's actually the third album report where it is it may be your best album what do you got to be one I got to be ... cording to melody maker\nIn the u._k. which is very influential weekly music a rag secret treaties was the top rock album of all time all the time and this was in Nineteen Seventy five so they were looking ahead to all the time that's pretty good [laughter]\nThat that is pretty amazing and that was ... reaper came out which was the Asian Asian fortune oh yeah that's\nThat's before disco inferno by the train it's getting\nThere you are [laughter] which would have been the best right of all time I'd love that song [laughter] I'd ever get tired [laughter]\n[laughter] I Would never have expected that to come out of your mouth but enough [laughter]\nOh but you know what I like I've heard and I was a real fan of Asperger's I bought all their albums are in the two thousands I guess it was oh I think there were tremendous because I'm a huge airport convention fan and they had the sound of that band I'm pat almost yeah\nLet's see if we have quite a few times why the Fillmore east you know way back when\nAre you are so lucky yeah uh-huh but I'd give to go back [laughter] 'cause I thought well\nMaybe maybe they'll get time travel we got\nHome maybe but in the meantime there's always Richard Thompson who I've seen about forty times so they are never see oh you haven't oh green alive show even those who can't stand is albums go to a show and they say wow so it's worth checking out there I brought up ... because flaming\nOr did you like that cover of that so I\nI Can't really count it because I don't\nKnow well there's another one I recommend you go to once you're through with your catalog they might want to move in a couple of God but I just\nI just wish somebody would have some pets somebody's covers I Wish I Wonder why yeah it's been a lot of coverage that don't you know so they\nAre you talking because uh financially the financial and\nYeah you know and also it's another six seats with your soul you know that's another recommendation for it so much as a piece of work absolutely you\nDon't like kissing consciousness make [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nThey can gather their banks have been a little\n... and then there are better at learning things fell down yeah da\nDa da da da da\nDa da da\nDa da\nDa\nDa\n\n\nDa\n\n\nDa da da\nDa da da\n\n\n\n\nDa da\nDa da da da\nDa da da da da da da\nDa da\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd that was one of two Patti Smith\nTend tunes that was The Revenge of Vera Gemini off as agents of fortune Nineteen Seventy six and we heard career of evil\nFrom secret treaties Nineteen Seventy four yeah Patty girlfriend a balance ... near of the band and a wrote a few songs with them we also heard from\nWhich album Specter's from Seventy seven one of their heads Godzilla and before that another huge\nHit the don't fear the reaper album originally to be found an agent so fortune but we heard the demo which is a bonus track on the release of ages hope fortune in Nineteen Seventy six\nSo I thought you might get a kick out of that particular version and it's really fun really nice actually I like it and it's a demo form\nI Hope you did too I Know you were expecting the big blown out official version sorry okay let's continue on here with buck Dharma of blue oyster cult\nOn WNPR melt true was um booted from your band at one point and it was a very a kind of a risk gay reason suggested out there that he was messing with your mom at your wedding any truth to that\nThat didn't really have anything to do with his participation Richard it's sort of anti social in a way that you know that even exams or their own family but uh\nOh great well I intend to go so thank you so much once again a mate Donald rose or [laughter] or buck die as the case may be okay take care of a good afternoon sir yeah you too Bye bye now and uh\nThere's tougher vice friday Alex McNeil on Monday march ... and on Tuesday\nIt's me again and I'm about I'm gonna run to the other studio now and do a phone or what do we ... which will be airing next week and special\nAnd I guess uh that's about all you need to know right now so we're going to go on to listen to Ken Field of the new age you're listening to W.

I think I should say I'm along with ... and um\nThat project is called the one hundred dollar guitar project is it's got its start when a Chuck found a a ... a guitar for sale and Japanese I think you are for sale for a hundred dollars on line purchased it centered around to a wide number of guitarist and some non guitarists in fact\nAnd ask them to record attract with it and the result and to C. D. set was released on bridge records called the one hundred dollar guitar project there's some very a great music on here from some wonderful musicians\nHum I won't list them uh but I'll mention a couple of names or research Adam are indeed deny into a new Nick at the ... Tom ... a Henry Kaiser Fred Fred with\nI'm Roger Miller and the list goes on and on um I actually contributed a track even though I'm not a guitarist and uh we'll play the track by truck on Mira it's a short one it's called until it all went terribly arrive\nAnd after that from a solo CD that chuckle mirror released under the name cw protests like called Fifteen demonic devices will listen to a two things one morning comes and clouds began together\n\n\n\nYeah\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nNo [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMm\n\n\n\n\n\nUm\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nWho will\n[noise]\nAlthough I\n\n... ... ... ...\n\nCan\n\nAsk\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] gosh\n\n\n\n\nSorts\nAnd over\n[laughter]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] and from the CD unsettled scores a compilation C D we listen to a forever Einstein's rendition of the true we'll be followed by cocoa Pataki in\nIn a a kind of a um\nHe just seemed to be protests ...

MBR in Cambridge and we're I'm pleased to have on the telephone with us\n[noise] uh Dmitri it's a Moscow and are are you there yeah perfect uh it all works\nAnd did I say the name right yeah close enough okay\nClose enough ah and you're calling from uh where a Princeton New Jersey somewhere in there\nI live in Philadelphia actually so I commute to Princeton where I work\nOkay um and so you're calling from Philly I Want to give a little introduction ah and I'll just talk about you and you correct me if I say anything incorrectly um so you were born uh in Massachusetts in Northampton uh and uh\nWell I have to stop you there I was actually born in Cambridge well wait\nJust a minute [laughter] I didn't get very far you know [laughter] right\nRight here in Cambridge well that's a that's great and I let me give you a heads up that you're with a ... page is incorrect\nOh my gosh okay yeah those were born in North Hampton\nUh uh you uh studied at Harvard uh studied composition music theory philosophy a did work in philosophy a and you got a PHD in composition from a UC Berkeley\nAnd the red cliff Institute for advanced study\nAnd ah you've released a what three four CDs now I think is that right\nThat's right ah and we have ... I I was only able to find one of them in our library I Know I'd seen the Rube Goldberg variations are in the past but I couldn't find it in library now we have music from crock pot him no I came out of a number of years ago but a will play a couple of trucks from that\nAnd um you know probably of interest to our listeners also is your ah your work on the theory of music uh and I'm not sure if you're a a looking forward to talking about that at all or if you're willing to talk about that I find it fascinating I haven't had the opportunity to read the book a geometry of music\nUm book that came out when in a [noise]\nI think two thousand eleven I'm happy to talk about anything you want to talk about\nOh that's great [laughter] I like to talk so and if you like to talk we're going to have a great time here uh and once again to remind folks that we're talking to composer and music theorist I guess that would be safe to say a Dimitri to Moscow and um\n[noise] uh you know let's start out with the book came out in two thousand eleven a geometry of music I'm I'm going to read from the wicked PT page it says to Moscow proposes a general framework for thinking about tonality arguing that there are five basic features that jointly contribute to the sense of analogy um [noise]\n... ... ... how do you start when you talk to people maybe you haven't read the book and who are ... ... talk about this uh this works that you've done on the theory of music of the theory of a finality um can you can you give us a little introduction I guess\nSure there are two ways to think about it one way is or is it more personal way and I'm the generation of composers who grew up\nDick and there's a natural tendency for young people to rebel against old people so a lot of people in my generation than younger than me we're thinking about musical ideas that had been discarded as irrelevant ah ideas about how to put\n'em notes together in a tunnel way about that that wasn't just ripping off Brahms or nineteenth century music thinking about I'm just thinking about music in in a different way being interested in jazz improvisation in those kinds of things [noise]\nUm the that led me to thinking about what makes music tonal what what makes music agreeable to you know the generic listener who doesn't have\nSpecial training 'em and because I had a philosophy background and a bit of a math background and because\nI was fortunate to have older colleagues who were sort of thinking about these same questions uh it led to a kind of um geometrical representation of music where you could sort of\nLook at music instead of seeing notes on the score you could look at it in terms of these a powerful an abstract models where chords were points higher dimensional space and composers like Chopin or Beethoven\nEffectively were\nManeuvering around these conceptual spaces of musical possibility and exploiting their intrinsic geometry and then um\nA lot of the work I've been doing since then has just thinking about how different tonal languages exploit these not obvious features of the spaces of musical possibility and and using mathematical models to um to get another\nWhat sounds I use the word in in quotes good what sounds yeah and and is is some of this work or not I assume some of this work is uh analytical or you know in terms of looking back at music that has been\nComposed 'em and seeing how it fits in or or maybe constructing this framework based on an analysis is it also and correct me if I'm wrong about that but is it also ah the framework for music synthesis for composing\nYeah what I Would say is there is no such thing as a as a recipe for writing really GOOD Music there is no cookbook or short cut 'em\nBut what I Would say is that understanding how music works at this sort of deeper conceptual level can lead you to new ideas about how to put notes together one thing is you know you can look at what other composers have done\nAnd instead of sort of stealing the notes themselves you know borrow a cord from Wagner borrow some scales from Debbie see or something like that\nYou can sort of look at the deeper principles and then ask yourself well\nWhat are they doing at this deep level and then maybe apply those same procedures in in New sonic environments with new harmonies and something like that [laughter]\nThe other the other thing I Would say that's maybe more personal is um I ended up with something a little bit like a Noam Chomsky theory about\nLanguage so Noam Chomsky thinks all the different human languages are kind of variations on a single\nFunctional structure and I don't know if I'd go as far as him but I Would say lots of different total styles specially western style\nSlightly different ways with slightly different collections of harmonies and ideas about how they um\nHow they relate and so in my own music this has led me or reinforced maybe a natural inclination to want to put those things together and ask if I can make\n\n[noise] and it was music or by my ... my guest to ... and ah it was so compelling I couldn't bring myself to fade down there to meet tree\nI'm really grateful I was worried about when you were going to stop\nYeah no I did there was no there was no reason or place for a a wonderful a work\nAnd that piece was a a titled this picture seems to be the first movement a and called a Turing machine the performance by the time or nay string quartet I was looking for the uh in the booklets you're on it's a bridge recordings abridge records a\nRelease him
