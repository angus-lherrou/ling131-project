MBR Cambridge my name is Amy filling in for Linda and this is what's left\nGiven the intensity and horrors going on on a day to day basis [noise]\nFrom the media\nTo ah the unrelenting\nTales of Kavanaugh and his uh [noise] exploits will just say\nWe thought it would be a good idea to take a moment today and do some recharging of our batteries [noise]\nSo what's left will be dedicated to\nActivists music not coincidentally because as Dave told us earlier during the news show [noise]\nThis weekend is the now world famous honk festival a celebration of activist street band and so [noise]\nA great excuse to play activist songs or songs that make you get up and you know either\nThat you'd like to hear that would fit this category of things that are Ari proverbial shot of adrenaline in your army musical shot of adrenalin if you will please let us know at six one step into five three eighty eight ten\n[noise] we are going to start with an old classic from Latin America that was really vital odds and made into us gum version by the Spanish band ... and uh\nThis is a song that that I return to again and again in many different forms um\nBecause it's just so powerful and infectious and this particular version is even better [laughter] so here you go there'll be NPR\nGiving you sound to keep you in the struggle\n[noise]\nDa da\nJust to say I'm\nInto trade on\nOn learning for\n\nAnd now\n[noise] ah there is a lantern parade\nIn fact people have been at the lantern making workshop earlier tonight uh they'll entered parade leaves from Hodgkin's park around David square and and they're sort of a D I why kind of lighting enjoy the darkness little ah kid friendly event um\nAnd then the official honk kickoff party is going to happen at the boom market which if you've not check that out that is in Union Square in Somerville and uh it starts at eight PM\nSome of the stuff they play it's it's all designed to be very interactive and very much a a community participation kind of experience um but ah that's still didn't really answer what is hawk\nSo I just thought I'd go back and try and tell you I'm\nBasically we know that street bans have ah been performing all over the world for a good long time says nothing new but but uh there's been a sort of interesting\nMovement to to infuse it with a lot of of activism and ah so these kinds of St bands are reclaiming public space like ah like Dave was mentioning earlier on on a show\nOn the local addition um [noise]\nAnd ah there as I was trying to put together in my own words about what it is as they say very lovely a very well three lovely [laughter]\nOn their own information um they're not just playing for the people they play among the people and they invite you to be a part of it and that's part of what makes a the festival just so much fun um\nIf you haven't had the opportunity to experience it this weekend\nMight be a great opportunity to check it out because unlike previous honk festival weekends it's supposed to be good weather the whole time so I find that encouraging\nTo say the least um [noise] the the bands themselves will be performing all day in Somerville Davis Square starting around noon and going until at least nine o'clock\nUm tomorrow\nAnd uh there will also be a sort of interactive art slash\nActivism segment on elm street where you can participate there um tomorrow afternoon from one PM to five PM and you know you could you could ah urge people too\nUm or just make some sort of goofy picture that expresses how you're feeling in the moment there's all kinds of possibilities there\nAnd then Sunday the hunk parade itself happens\nUm and that starts at noon as well and they go from David square in Somerville all the way to Harvard Square in Cambridge next door and uh again that's all of these different bands and it's not just local bands on started locally but now it's expanded and there'll be bands\nFrom Rhode Island and elsewhere in New England and there'll be coming in from Seattle I think and uh as far south as Brazil\nUm and they end that parade in Harvard Square and then they perform a big\nBeautiful stage set up right smack in the middle of Harvard Square it's it's something to behold let me tell you a little bit about what you have been listening to here briefly um we've been trying to get you a few selections here and there of some of the stuff that ah\nOne kid here if one were out in the street the next couple of days we caught a doom Maro do from the second line social aid and pleasure society brass band they are one of the originals here in the Boston area\nAnd we heard before them\nThe mad squirrel march from emperor Norton stationary marching band which delightful if you spell out those letters you get the acronym ensemble\nThey are also a from Somerville actually I'm pretty sure a local\nIf not from Somerville then somewhere in the greater Boston area and we started off with a decidedly not local group um the bond of basalt the out of Spain doing their version Scott if I'd of employment\nThe band the co chick\nBand or one of many that performs at hawk and ah although I was not able to find one of their cuts uh immediately I thought of something else that sort of a similar\nStyle I think um so we're going to do this next and then uh I Will uh see if we can't throw in some coach a band after that as well so this is I'm thought annoy her\nAnd they are a doing this amazing a bilingual Spanish and Russian song called ... being though we are the wind\nHere you go you can call six one seven to
