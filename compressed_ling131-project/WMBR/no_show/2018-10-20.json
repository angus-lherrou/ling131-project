of talking teens I Am Aden and I'm ... and this week because our friend that Talia from voice boxes out we will actually be here with you for eight to ... hours\nOf lovely programming or so we're going to start with the first hour which will be our regular deal today our topic is the wonderful Eric Clapton one of the world's greatest rock instrumental is I think it's fair to say and we're going to uh talk about different songs that spent his entire career he's\nWorked with many different people have been in many different bands and I think it's pretty interesting to listen to his career like\nChronologically because you can kind of hear the progression not only of his personal work but rock music in general so we're going to start you off with his very first band called the art birds or with a song called hurtful so\n[noise]\n[noise] oh\n[noise]\nYou know me well or\nMaybe you know\nMan oh\nLeft it to do our\nMe and I know\nYou have made by a ... or whatever but I Know\nA model oh\nJeez the\n[noise] [noise] [noise] and I know\nIt's yeah and well yeah well we're liquor that\nAlthough oh\nJeez you know\nOr longer than a man a bed and you will mean no or about\nAnd and the ... when she don't\nMe a\nAbout my ... and so are\nMe and I know\nYou're loaded yeah man by where there were never very good\nAbout oh blushing\nEighty eighty\nAnd again that was heart full of soul and uh we're taking a pause here because we're gonna know play some songs from uh some confidence other bands and also mentioned something interesting about the yard birds are they were a really famous British rock band way back in the day pioneers of\nPsychedelic rock as people like to call it but probably the most interesting thing about them is they actually started the careers of not only are often but Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page as well so three of the most important guitars of all time\nAre you actually joined the our birds when he's Eighteen uh it seems like most of the people who got the rise to fame start up young impressive\nYeah that's true for for for him to do something that high profile and here I Am Nineteen and [laughter] you know what am I done with my life right [laughter] makes you think anyways we're going to move on to uh the first man he joined after the yard birds or\nThe blues breakers and then after that get into some of perhaps more familiar stuff with cream [laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nBird or a new one\nNow\nAnd\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nI don't know where where\nAre you know\nI'm\n\nThing when you're\nThings in the same age and indeed and indeed [laughter]\nIt's all been waiting a little\nReally when I\nGo where they do [laughter] well I don't go away [laughter] and\nSaw that all of 'em\n[laughter] I Know ...\nOr ...\nOr a ...\nHave a ... or\nBut they're ...\n\n...\n\nAnd elderly no\n[noise] [noise]\n\nIt was fair and\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nThat are a\nWhole\nAnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nA little\nRight ah there\nAre a\n\nSo you just heard from China below like cream followed by a to cry today by blind date uh again that was the band that are often mood on to a kind of tried to for me too\nDespite all their challenge is was very short lived only lasted about a year and by the next year Nineteen Seventy he's already with a new band Derek in the dominos and a interesting story about how they got their name was that uh it was actually a contraction of sorts between a\nNo\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nA\n\n\nLast he taught those last two songs were key to the highway and Layla by Eric and the domino so as you may know if you are a a bus or the war a classic rock as we are I\nThose last few songs ... in particular were actually written about a woman named Patty boys who are eventually became cops in white but very interestingly before she was his wife was married to another extremely famous musician George Harrison\nWho was like basically a best friend ... ... and uh\nSo you may be wondering how does this happen that they that a\nBoy that ends up with with COPD in well I he basically like coached her away from George and um it it's probably the craziest part of the story is that George like steel\nThey also do who would do that but that friendship is very strong what a girl boroughs [laughter] anyways\nYeah so I stopped in a marriage and fortunately didn't last too much longer because Scott then became a serial alcoholic and something's gone downhill but\nAlso a did very serious drugs I'm In August of Nineteen Seventy one uh because of his heroin use he passed out during the concert in Bangladesh was then resuscitated him and finish the concert\nIn Spanish almost gone as we say\nOh by the way uh we've been publishing the songs that were playing on track blaster so if you missed the

who would ever say it's nothing serious it's just heart disease but you do hear those words about people living with another serious illness it's called depression\nAnd it threatens the lives of more than Fifteen million Americans\nLike heart disease symptoms can be misleading\nLike diabetes it's biologically based and like cancer it can be female [noise] so what we should say is what doctors and

our actual show because they don't really fit the the overall theme of our show very well\nSeveral different shows will be transitioning in between them as the hour goes on and it should keep you on your toes as a listener and so\nYeah if you guys have ever watched ... and seen one of the inner dimensional cable episodes I think that you'll find that this is somewhat analogous and is basically

I. S. andme located at fourteen eighty on the AM dial it was a top forty station actually had a a\nNumbered survey for their top thirty songs and then they had a few other songs below that in no\nParticular order and they didn't give that group of the survey and name or anything like that so that's what we've been sampling for the first part of the show\nWe started things off and Stevie Wonder I don't know why not one of his big it's just made the top forty here in the U.S picking a number thirty nine did a little better on billboards sold chart where it got up the number sixteen the Rolling Stones did a version of it in Nineteen Seventy five and had actually been recorded earlier but it came out in Nineteen Seventy five\nAfter Stevie Wonder where the IVs British group with maybe tomorrow that one only made it to number sixty seven on billboards national charts\nA few months later the group changed their name to bad finger and had considerable success but that was that when they were known as the IVs and they recorded on the apple label\nOne that was founded by the Beatles a year or so earlier after the ... the crying shame with first trained to California did not shark nationally to cry and James were from the Chicago area so stands to reason that they'd be fairly popular in Madison which is not too far away from Chicago\n[noise] and the last Sunday you heard was called a broken man by group called the Malibu\nSupplemental list and nothing more was heard from them about what it was unfortunately just kind of song you could imagine being recorded at Motown\nIn my opinion anyway right so we've got eight more of the uh numbered songs below the top dirty let's get right into it he was Aretha Franklin covering the bans the weight\n\nI'm a little band and are now being an by passing\nAnd you need to play the game that\nDay and then my bottom\n\n\n\nMan [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\n[noise]\n\nA very nice [laughter]\n[laughter]\nAnd then they said that you're there\n\n[laughter] na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nNa na na\n\nNa na na walk\nLeft and we made in the eye on\nThe on the wrong\nAnd [noise] first\n\nKnow there were nine oh\nOh yeah man\nWhile\nSome of them the wrong [noise] like day to buy the wine bars\nThem from the\nI\nTo the game is nearly [noise] come\n\n\nWell\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nEvery Saturday on eighty eight ... we choose your local radio station sometime in the past ... down their kids from radio station may lead from the U.S\nCanada Great Britain\n\nAustralia last week maybe from the fifties [noise]\nSixties [noise] seventies\nOr eighties [noise]\nEighty eight ... every Saturday for six to eight am right here on WNPR Cambridge the Jew and\nUnofficial good morning to you from all of us here at WNPR in Cambridge ... rerun for Saturday morning October twentieth\nAnd today we're counting down his from the week in February twenty second Nineteen sixty nine almost fifty years ago about forty nine and two Thirty years ago local radio station is from Madison, Wisconsin it's W.

the way up to number two on billboards hot hundred\nClassics for featuring Dennis used by the way they had several slight name changes during their three or four years of a puppet success when they first came on the scene in Nineteen sixty six they were simply the classics\nAnd then I think they changed their name because there's been other groups called the classic so they became the classics for when spooky came out\nEven though it was a quintet they call themselves the classics for and then by Nineteen sixty eight or so they had become the classic sport featuring Dennis Yost which is what they were at this time if it were sixty nine and then a few months later they changed your name once again a revised it to Dennis Yost end the classics for\n[noise] so you're taking notes on all
