Facebook communicate or be part of the conversation ... eighty one here on WNPR in Cambridge keep the rubber ... now\nYou say your vehicle has airbags high impact bumpers and you always wear your seatbelt so far so good but if you should cut in front of an Eighteen wheeler on the highway and make that truck jam on his breaks all of your high tech safety features just might sound like this [noise]\nIt can take a truck twice as long to stop as a car for your own safety give those big rigs a lot of rural remember tangle with a truck and you lose a public service message from the federal motor carrier Safety Administration\nHello out their welcome to collaborate on air I\nWarrants it is Wednesday eight PM and we're going to get started with some music so hope here\nAnd\nUm\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter]\nAnd um\n[noise] oh no\nNo and then the new\nIn and on\nThat in common and [laughter]\n\nAnd I'm\n[laughter]\n\n\nAnd\nBigger than\nThen in Haiti\nAnd\n\nGuys\nThat just came\nAnd so\nAnd [laughter]\n\nAnd oh by\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[laughter]\n\n\n[laughter]\nI don't\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah you have to pay it they they they in fact you may be like\nGod\nBless make bad as plain as you know just\nSo that's kind of what what I've been thinking about\nWhat do you have some uh some ideas or doesn't have examples like okay I Do\n[noise]\nClear [laughter] ... [laughter]\nUm and usually that's to your point like a pretty affirming space yeah it's like oh yeah great I don't have to worry about being heterosexual here and have to like hide any parts of myself\nSo I thought why not to hide parts of myself that in most parts of my life like have to hide 'em but what I found\nI think this is probably fine ...\nI'm not going to go with that example if we go with a different example same can be really okay [laughter] like I Want one in the community sat on the line death so many examples definitely\nUm [noise] so there's this like division or there's um a way that people present\nA which\nBreaks down or divides along the line of masculine versus feminine yeah and so you know some people exist along the dinner spectrum but in\nI'll say especially like homosexual male community or like the clear male community there is like in the rest of society a real this taste or\nDisdain for people who come off as feminine or a feminine or ... um and it sort of shows up on a dating apps where like a particular type of man who tends to be like pretty macho pretty masculine and often they like\nShow a lot of machismo are like no fan of fans [laughter] and you know on a dating app in theory or like connecting with people who would be of interest to you um and so you're sort of ...\nAnd so for there to be this like no fans\nWill you be in ... states levels to this is like levels to this [laughter]\nSo that's the one um and someone who you know I definitely have identified for most of my life is more masculine but as I'm getting older and as I feel like I'm getting a little freer I'm just like yeah my hips way when I was [laughter]\nIt feels good [laughter]\nBecause I'm Free\nYeah 'cause I'm pretty like don't don't put me in a little box yeah like just 'cause I'm trying to feel good doesn't mean you get attacked me anyway so as I'm like becoming more in relationship to my side I'm like seeing those\nConversations are those like things in the world as increasingly problematic there were always problematic but I'm getting to see them as problematic when other example um you know I Would say in my Christian Community growing up there was also sorry if you are listening actually I'm not sorry\n[laughter] I've talked to him mostly all about this also hey mom [laughter]\nI forgot I was supposed to give 'em a shot at every episode [laughter] um [noise] yeah and some of my old Christian community there were just like a lot of racism yeah but\nYou know in theory we were all Christian like we were all there because we love Jesus or because we wanted to do right by the people in our community to people around us and\nYet even though we shared this one identity we really are not aligned on some of the subdivisions within our community\nYeah so those are two examples that I've experienced I probably have like\nFive to one thousand more but I Will leave it there\nYep yep I think um I never really\nThought about this the divisions within the\nAnd that's when you're like wait but they're not even really men here [laughter] so why am I feeling like this you know like what happened yeah um and I ... yeah the same thing I think I'm\nI think something I'm hearing what you're saying and something that I'm reflecting on as well as you know it's one thing when there is that\nOppressive force is president and it's one thing when in some ways they are pushed the side and you think like oh my God say space and then you realize you know the more oppressive part is that they're ingrained in all of us if you know it's in the\nFiles are you [laughter] know during the computer has started you know [laughter] it always comes back to [laughter] but actually yeah I hear you but yeah the impression the minds of your oppressors\nOr in us yeah yeah so um [noise] yeah so the and the ways that ease and\nMembers of subjugated groups subjugate others um it's pretty sad it sucks but it yeah and it's um\nSometimes I think for a lot of people sometimes hard to like recognize when that's happening what do you mean for a more I guess\nI'm\nI think a lot of the time especially with words we just say ... really and we're not thinking about I'm trying to think of the more it's more explicit example that I can bring but um\n[noise]\nI'll I'll think of one I'm sure I have some but [laughter] but I mean even in kind of like what you were saying about the\nThe community queer women's community as well you know I mean like I think um\nAs much as we're like we're doing you know where the free ones were doing whatever we want to do for a month you know whatever you know I think there's the same amount of\nYeah but it seems like we are still really sticking to this like someone's the girl and someone's guy thing and it's not only do the exhibit that in our relationship but then in the way we talk about other relationships are people that may not fully described to that have like ...\nI was like oh my God there's such a weird couple\nEnds [laughter] when you're just like way I thought we were in this because it's women [laughter] yeah\nWhy does it matter or why do we have to hold ourselves to the old ...\nYeah and I and I think I think a lot of times it's not people like explicitly holding themselves knew him but then they're like realizing or not even realize they're acting in your acting it out and saying whoa yeah who was a um\n\nOkay so do several things one just on the example about words\nUm this\nIs a conversation I have like on a regular basis or not I mean thing several times today several times yesterday I probably have a couple of times on friday\nI'm a\nWho are really like I don't like many pastors but this one I like his name is Eugene Peterson is the first to say this but I like the way he says he says we cannot be too careful about the words we use we started out using them and they ended up using a ... and I think that\nFor the most part like people did not come up with the category of black [laughter] it was like something that was described to us right particularly for financial gain of non black people right it was like an economic system um\nAnd now\nIt is a category that people used to unite ourselves like the great black\nPower black a black everything was a kind of us like everything you know we pay fiasco or did they ask you pay 'em and like excellence\nLike ex yeah as a highly nominated [laughter] highly\nValidated lives in their lives and not ... but I'm gonna let it slide [laughter] um\nYou know and so now there's like this identity that is that was created by someone else that black people are now using ... and you know this isn't to say that this is it to like put judgment on that particular practice but we didn't make\nThat up [laughter] I didn't come from us [laughter] um yeah so that's a thing that I think about often it's like okay so just to be clear with ourselves like somebody else made this thing up and now we are now we're using it\nYeah yep do we do we haven't thought about that [laughter]\nYeah in a bright but\nHaving experience to other forms of western society\nIt's you know same thing today sanctioning yeah\nUm yeah for self reflection\nHe sure\nAnd the others community reflection or like community accountability [noise] and sometimes that looks like you have people\nWho feel\nTo like a dear friend\nThat was messed up or I think some other things like\nArt to be someone who can check in with the community around you at some sort of regular basis where there was one on one or in group settings um a friend of mine is a part of a men's group the meeting for a couple of years and I think one of the ... I don't think one of the things they do is because they meet\nEither weekly or bi weekly and they're meeting for years now it's like they see each other in places outside of this like their meetings\nAnd so they have the ability to they have the ability and time and space to like surface issues with each other in a community of people who can then hold\nAn environment they can hold space for dealing with whatever someone saw or heard or felt so I think you know that's another thing like can I go to my community and ask them to give me feedback\nWhich is different than them just giving me the time because they feel like it's a good thing to do this and I think connected to that is also like having regular process sees that are just a part of your life\nWhereby you get feedback um something that I've done basically every place I've ever worked\nIs like implement like pushed to implement like an evaluation structure mhm like suffer valuation supervisor evaluation and ideally and it's happened in a couple of places\nLike multi directional evaluation like my co workers should evaluate me my supervisors should evaluate me people who I managed to evaluate me and people who are like beyond\nThe scope of our you know quote unquote organization like people who aren't paid by us should have the ability to like get in and help me reflect\nOn a regular basis like if they know that I'm the person who's doing that thing they also have some opinion it might not carry the same weight as my supervisor or people I supervised but those opinions are still valid and like I think having a\nHaving as many points information as possible only makes your ability to reflect better mhm so yeah I just I was a long way of saying I agree suffer function community reflection or like ways\nTo deal with it when it shows up in your house\nYeah and I think a little bit of a possible tangible connection between in what we're talking about now and I'm going back to ... in the Pentagon is\nWhen we have these reflective moments and when we have these uh our community calling us out I was kind of our community um\nTV to take care of one another to ... be aware of what's what's going on in the background that you know it wasn't just using this it was\nThe miserable hand it was you know it was the oppressor and your mind you know it was all these things I'm so as much as I Want to you know talk to you about this I also need to talk with those things in mind\nYeah like the aware that there are made whole levels of the action that are happening right you know I really like are there multiple what's the word scales which all of\nThese sites are contributing yeah\nYeah right there's a structure often your call before levels of oppression Mm I think it is just as much the level of change and um\nCultural an institutional\nI think the last two are reversed generally in order a cultural is the biggest one institutional is like inside of it got it but anyways it was like four levels for scales at which all of these things show up and so you know to your point it's like yes I can talk to you about this thing\nBut if we were like in a family\nThat has been raised for a couple of generations with this particular trend yeah that's the thing we have to be in conversation with as well as you know if we all go to the same church or hundreds of people are being taught this\nAnd they live in a society where like all the presidents have been a particular way mhm we like have to be engaging with all the levels of this thing\nAnd we have to be care I mean I think what you were saying is we have to take care with each other and knowing that it's an individual as well as a level of\nInterest in that oh there's a lot of work hard and sometimes we get tired sometimes just tired [laughter] ... yeah yeah\nWell I'm curious\nAs some songs that are very relevant to this conversation I think what do you have any sons that are relevant to this conversation\nI mean I Would just love to hear hear yours I mean\nI'll be one okay and then yeah I really want to hear I mean I don't know if you as long as you listen to this er which would want to put the music on the air\n\nYou start check our all up and fly okay well let's see if I could find this particular track here again where are they listening to the U.S\nEverywhere and\nAll the way her left on the radio if

sound and fury\nWhere unconventional wisdom mates dramatic radio\nI'm Dave Goodman AKA the central ... they call me that because I like to dwell on things\nThat we can't allow\nThe more time for new smears to damage judge Kavanaugh his family his reputation the reputation of the court and of course the reputation of the country we cannot allow more time for ... cents on the left to try to be judged capital into submission\nWe can for a long this process knowing that\nWhich shouldn't for a long and it's what I'm saying so without knowing that\nFrankly we've reached the point where it's time to end the circus it's time to show some dignity around here it's time to vote uh people can make they're closing statements that can vote whatever way they want to uh nobody's telling them what to do\nAnd frankly we've had enough time on this to the to choke a horse and I just have to say let's be fair but this\nThey must have tiny horses in Utah it occurs to me there wasn't enough fairness during the Kavanaugh hearings to choke a ferret speaking of ferrets after using the litter box they will rubbed their bottoms on your carpet\nIt's a way of marking territory and telling other ferrets I was here while listening to judge K. and the senators of the Judiciary Committee do you imagine there's a lot of soiled carpet in DC\nFolks it's probably going to get a lot worse before it gets better Senator Orrin hatch summed up the new political reality in Washington when he was confronted by several women why tend to find themselves that sexual abuse survivors and he told them\n\n\nThe point is these women broke the rules they told US Senator what to do and where to go\nThat's just not done to these people\nAnd as masters of the universe super rich or super powerful often both they believe they are CEO of the planet\nAnd you and I and everyone not a member of this exclusive club is a nuisance to be contained like asset a picnic and\nColumnist Charles Blow writing in the New York times says it is for them it's not simply a game about political passion and political principles and this is a game of power pure and simple and it's about whether the people who have long held that power will be able to retain for them\nAnd Trump is just a useful idiots and a temporary anomaly\nThey are thinking generationally not in terms of the next election cycle but in terms of the next epic\nBlow offers a device liberals have to look beyond emotions he writes beyond reactionary electoral enthusiasm\nBeyond needing to fall in love with the candidates in order to vote for them and\nBeyond the coming election and toward becoming showdown [noise]\nAnd he adds this warning about conservative calls for originalism on the Supreme Court\nWhen I think of originalism I think this many of the founders owned slaves\nIn the constitution they viewed black people is less than fully human they didn't want women or poor white men to vote the founders a bunch of rich powerful white men didn't want true democracy in this country and in fact we're dreadfully afraid of it now\nA bunch of rich powerful white men want to return us to this sensibility wrapped in a populist follow the constitution rallying cry and disguised as the ultimate form of patriotism we have\nTo learn to see everything around us all that is happening on the ...\nA bridge to dramatically slashed legal immigration are all about\nEfforts by Republicans in fact to demonize the visa lottery system blow writes is an effort to preserve America's white majority against the statistical eventuality for as long as possible [noise]\n\nYou know in some ways\nIt feels like Alice in wonderland around\nIt's unbelievable where we are today it's it's almost surreal\nWhere an urban and they very weak\nYear\nOr the Southern Poverty Law Center the S L peace or as TLC\nIs a decades old organization that exists for the purpose of monitoring and working against hate groups are so visit their site\nLearn about them and again see what there is that you can do to support them\nUh and of course Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood not immediately recognizable as a quote unquote um political organization they're they're a health care provider but they are very much under attack right now and deserve our support\nAnd our effort into a these this overall effort that we want to make um how do we do that well we volunteer our time that's easy to do\nThere's plenty of ways to do it you want to voluntarily gone for your time as much and as often as you can you can work a phone bank\nOr a text bank a Frank is on the call he does both I'm Frank those virtual phone bank work virtual text bank work\nUm he can do that from home or you can go into a group setting so that the you've got that good morale boost that you get from working within a larger group um but there's lots of opportunity out there to be on the phone or sending text or sending emails\nI'm supporting either a candidate\nOr a I'm a physician or whatever it happens to be uh there's there's plenty of opportunity there\nOr you can also a contact the DNC\nUm the DNC certainly will be able to put you in touch with your uh your local candidates and their uh their campaigns um there are unpaid positions paid positions I'm\nPatty who was on the Cole I'm recently took a job it's a paid position registering people to vote 'em I mean those jobs are out there and they're out there right now it's you know we're coming into an election\nUm the campaigns have money to spend hiring people to work on their campaigns so if you need the money or you're willing to volunteer both types of opportunities exist\nCan also get involved through indivisible [noise] um if you click on this link and I'll go ahead and click on that and open it up\nAfter your local group and if you look at the map you'll see but the number of jobs that are about to hear how many chapters there are\nOperational right now throughout the United states so uh there's many many local opportunities to get directly involved\nGet started today literally as soon as this presentations if you've got some time go on line get on the phone start making contacts with people who you can coordinate with\nAs I said get either a paid or volunteer gig\nYou know doing something like registering folks to vote or you can organize transportation on election day to help get people to the polls critically critically important function\nI'm if you've got a mini van or an SUV and you can transport some people you know go someplace where people typically have trouble being mobile a nursing home\nOr or the inner city or wherever it happens to be um and find out how you can help get people to the polls especially people who are going to vote blue\n[noise] you know go out and helping neighborhoods most prone to have voter registration voter id and voter transportation issues um be aware of where I'm these recent attacks on the voter rolls and voter registration\nYou know known as a voter purges you want to be aware of where that's been going on and you want to be involved in helping people make sure they they are registered to vote\nThey're registered to vote with apple time in advance of the election um you don't want people to show up on election day and realized that their registration has been purged that they're in eligible to vote for any reason they need to be where weeks in advance whether they're\n\n[noise] and then finally there's active participation in the resistance and that is getting out there in the street and rallying and marching and protesting and also standing up\nTo the opposition with counter route counter rallies counter marches and counter protests um there's gonna be I'm\nA very unfortunate event in Portland, Oregon today\nUm to white supremacist groups are going to be ... holding a rally in downtown Portland um they're doing it or to generate publicity for themselves but also to instigate um\nContact ah they hope violent contact with with um local antifa um\nOver or other types of resistance groups and people need to turn out in mass in overwhelming numbers to counter rallies like that and counter them peacefully um you know nobody wants riots in the street nobody wants you know open warfare or in the middle of a city\nOr the best way to counter these cowardly groups which typically are relatively small you know a couple of hundred people\nIs to make sure that our site shows up with thousands of people\n[noise] so you need to get comfortable walking shoes you need to make a sign and you need to have a good breakfast and then get out in the street\nYou need to get out there you need to be involved you need to show up and the reason is is because the president he watches TV we want to make sure that the crowds that he sees protesting him and his regime\nAre as loud as large as determined\nBy a motivated involved populace people have gotten involved they've turned out in massive numbers and they've been able to over through all sorts of violent evil extremist\nStrongman type regimes throughout our history this is no different so get out there whenever you can\nNow this is really important um the opposition wants to intimidate you and they're intimidation methods and tactics are very very well developed but you can easily defeat those methods and tactics you simply have to be smart about exposing your identity\nAnd we all interact on Facebook\nI see how many of you\nDisplay yourselves display or identities on Facebook and you're just plain information that exposes you\nTo harassment\nYou want to make yourself what's known as doc scene resistance and for those who don't know what doc scene is doc scene is when your personal identity is uncovered typically on line by the opposition and then it is used as a means to harass you and your family\nDoc seen though is easy to avoid all you need to do is not expose your identity online\nAfter the presentation I Want everybody to go and take a look at my social media identity my Facebook page and you're going to notice the following key items the first is I Do not use my actual name you can\nGo and search my Facebook name on the Web and you will not find me and the reason is it's not my name I've altered it a little bit so maybe sounds a little bit like my name and people who I Know\nOr anywhere else somebody cannot than take that name or other information about me go online and find out a my home address be my family members see where I work\nWe want to keep all of that information as private as humanly possible and here's the best ways to do that\nI Do not use my real name I recommend you do not either Facebook let you change your name I think once every Ninety Days or sixty days\nUm I Would definitely go in there and I would alter your name to something that is not just connect herbal tea your real name\nThe next my profile photo and my cover photo they do not show my face they certainly do not show the faces of my family so last thing I Want for public consumption or something you know what I look like or even worse what my loved ones look like\nYou know they're going to be different medium that you can use newspapers TV radio websites books even movies absorb them all so following his list of some recommendations newspapers and websites the Washington Post of course\nThe New York times of course Mother Jones ProPublica and any others that you are aware of read them for racially yeah whenever you've got free time you know in the bathroom in jail in bed at night before you go to sleep you know on the train during lunch\nGet online read absorb you've got to be knowledgeable\n\nAh also for TV and radio uh I'm sure most of you watch MSNBC um if you don't start you you really want to uh expose yourself to their eight pm to their midnight line up I'm\nChris Hayes Rachel Maddow I'm Lawrence O'Donnell um that these are great journalist but more important than that they've got very very powerful research teams behind them and their ...\nThat's such a valuable outlet is they're going to be the first place you're going to hear about a lot of things that will be in tomorrow's news\n[noise] also on YouTube there's a a YouTube channel for the young Turks um give that a shot see if that's your cup of tea of course listen to NPR listen to the Pacific a network great sources of\nA news reporting but also um you know deep digging investigative journalism\n[noise] ah I've got some links here to ah some books that I think you should also be reading a resistance guide ah also similar to that the indivisible resistance guide\nOr and then a book that is available on Amazon called this is an uprising which is written by one of the authors of the resistance guide you know download those those books and\nYou know learn them live there's so much useful information there I'm a thousand times the information that we are covering today\nAnd then finally there mode of movies that can motivate you can inspire you um there's two you know classic resistance films um to help inspire you into what a resistance looks like and the sacrifices that are made\nThe first is answer Boyd as upwards a true story um it's uh it's about the check\nA resistance during World War two against the Nazis or the second is fantasy it's V. for vendetta but it's a it's a great story and it will motivate you will inspire you so it's definitely worth watching and they're both good weekend film so\nWatching this weekend if you're if you're looking for something to spend some time with\n[noise] and now we're going to start to wrap up and and talk about something that uh is very\nYou can do to push past that limit you know you're going to reach limits and and those are limits of time or limits of effort or limits of money or limits of energy [noise] um and you have to be ready to identify those limits and do what you can to energize yourself to push past\n[noise] you also may at some point reaching limit regarding confrontation or this is a delicate subject\nIt's essentially how far you were willing to confront the opposition or even the authorities only you know where those limits are now that confrontation it can be something\nI'm as small as\nConfronting someone who UC wearing some sort of a Republican message on their vehicle or on their clothing or their hat and\nAnd um you feel that you need to confront them on it only you know how to do that went to do it where to do it um war confronting a bigger threat [noise] um\nYou know so before pushing past those particular limits the limits of hey I'm going to get out in the street and I'm going to put on you know an antifa garb and\nYou know a black then down over my face and the gas mask and you know pick up a roadblock or whatever it is um I cannot tell you to do that I cannot tell you not to do that\nIt's important that you consult with your family your own conscience and your own abilities and see how far you want to take your personal confrontational levels um that's going to be completely up to you or you're going to have to be ready to end\nIn the face are kicking the ribs or a night in jail I mean if you really take your resistance to that level those those are the hazards I'm sure you're shy away from that only you know I'm sure to participate only you know\nBut be careful about those decisions [noise]\n[noise] you know I Know where my own limits are um uh my my limits are based on you know my experience and in my life story and my own abilities and you know my level of anger\nAnd you know I'm not going to necessarily talk about what those limits are but you know I'm well aware of where they are and I'm ready to go right up to that lie\nChili Palmer and a weapon or on resistance and activism that was recorded in August of this year\nThanks to Chile for giving us permission to share that information take whatever you need out of it and apply\nApply that information that is the only a call to action that uh I Will give you this evening that I'm allowed to give you this evening\nTake whatever information you glean from this program over the years going forward and apply that information in ways that make sense to you\nIs this sound and fury I'm Dave Goodman your central ... and they call me that because I like to dwell on things if you would like to help me dwell on things you can contact the program while we're here at the station or you can always leave a message when we're not\nSo if you try to text me when I'm not here not on the air let's say uh I probably won't get the message but if you call and speak to one of our lovely receptionists\nOr D jays or a management personnel they will take a message they ... they will be glad to take a message six one seven to five three eight eight one zero and what I'm not speaking on the microphone to you directly you can call and I'll speak to you on the phone or\nIf you prefer to let your fingers do the talking\nSix when seven to five three eight eight one zero for our tax line as well\n[noise] to do something a bit more permanent in terms of the Internet you can always send us an email\nEmails have gotten a bad reputation in the last few years primarily because of the former presidential candidate and secretary of state\nAnd also a newly minted Supreme Court justice Who Lied and I'm not making this stuff off this was ... this was in the real news uh lied about his\nActivities involved involving stolen emails emails stolen from a senator's Democratic senators party members of the Democratic party who were working on strategies to a oppose\nCertain um certain judges chosen for the federal bench federal judge positions by the Bush administration and kind of like the ... the Watergate plumbers they stole this information from a Democratic senators and a\nJudge Kavanaugh it has now been revealed as as a result of the people researching this stuff um that he lied about his\nIllegally stolen um but he didn't know that he didn't know he did know and he was involved in crafting a response to the Democratic strategy using information that was supposed to be private\n\nBut hypocrisy and duplicitous ... seems to be a calling card of people some people have the ruling people in Washington these days so it's not surprising\nAnd\n\nCan\nOn alert on me\nMade the ...\nThe email and\nMoney yeah\nDe\nLa ...\nOn to\nPhone\nCall me like a long\nGame\n\n\n\nOn and [laughter]\n\nWell speaking Bremer [noise]\nSo you you are seeing the world be\nAway early on when\n\n\nKnow\nI\nDown\n\nThat\nI\nKnow\nAnd I am a na na\nNa na\n...\nEvery day\nOf African\nBall\nWe ran with tears\nI ever bought a free one\nAnd being a basically what that what that what that does is\nIt shields corporations are from a from a law suits and and and and legal cases are where they would otherwise be liable for their actions\nIt also protects I'm ... oh soak ah groups that are due so called political advocacy five oh one C. four groups which have become known as super PACs\nThat can basically say anything they want and pump any sort of money a into a fomenting\nMissed truths and untruths as a way of supporting a particular ah a policy or political position\nSo a yes vote would form a committee to consider whether or not or Massachusetts should take a specific stand on Citizens United in and at a and and and say that it's you know and look at whether or not it's a good idea to give corporations those sorts of human rights\nOr the other day I had an opportunity to meet the director of a new film that explores these issues of\nMoney in politics the film is called dark money and the director and producer his name is Kimberly read\nShe happens to be a transgendered women uh she was in town Jews in Cambridge recently for a film her film was being shown at Harvard University\nAnd uh the film is it it's called dark money it's supposed to be very good I haven't seen it yet but it's supposed to be very interesting is actually a free\nAnd is showing it off of their website um and uh but if you if you are you go to a if if you if you go to whatever uh a search engine you use and plug in dark money the film you'll get a link to how to see that film for free\nOr this entire month of October I think it's a I think it's very fair and um\n[noise] judicious of the folks behind dark money too or allow the soon to be in the public domain at least for the time being and then I think it will be shown on a on a that are on a public broadcasting\nSo there's so there's that and then the third question probably the most ah controversy all of the three is whether or not hospitals should be forced to maintain strict ah\nAh whether or not hospitals should be limited to a a ... whether or not nurses in hospitals should be limited to a certain number of patients I think is that that that is the basic wording on on on that question\nUh nurses have been saying for a long time that they can't give\nA the proper amount of care and attention to patients when they're overwhelmed with with with patients in hospitals they say stack so many patients on onto um nurses workload a and don't hire more nurses or as a wave of saving money\nAnd so a yes vote on that question on the nursing question ah would put limits on how many patients each nurse can see it any one time can be dealing with it any and serving any any particular time now the hospitals\nWhich are pumping a huge amounts of of money into a negative adverse\nBasically scaring people in it too into believing that I'm folks are going to die in hospitals if ah if\nThere are limits on the number of patients each nurse can can can ah can serve now on on the surface that doesn't seem to make that doesn't seem to make sense although that was a ... a report recently ah that said that the cost\nTo ah to hospitals are would be in the ... I think the nine hundred million dollar range whereas the Massachusetts nurses association\nOr the main union representing nurses throughout the state is saying was because the cost would be closer to more than a a more to three hundred million dollars of course they're arguing that\nProtecting nurses\nProtecting nurses from burn out his ah is ultimately very important and uh giving nurses putting limits on the amount of patience allows nurses to serve patients that they that they do have\nA more a more efficient land appropriately\nHospitals like other corporations want to have a flexibility\nThink is the business term uh to uh increased workload has as much or as little as they want they don't want any restrictions they don't want any regulations I mean we've seen\nWe've seen the death of ... of of of the regulatory protocols in this country maybe not the death but the the slow death of regulatory protocols in this country as a result of the pro business\nA approach that the federal government and many state governments have been taking in the aftermath of the Trump election or the or hospitals\nNurses or organization the ah\nThe national or the or the nurses association of America something like that a group now I've been covering as a reporter some of this for a while I'd never heard of this group I'm not saying I Know for sure that it's a front group that was created for this purpose\nThis other union that's against the uh the nursing limits a I'd had just never heard of a beforehand Massachusetts nurses association which does support this question and does support limits on the numbers of patients um\n[noise] uh is the main nursing union in in in the state of Massachusetts now will will there be consequences absolutely now the nurses are helping the hospitals will hire more nurses hospitals don't want to do that\nOr because they have to maintain their their margins and their CEOs have to continue to um profit\nThat's a whole other question which I'm not going to get into tonight about uh health and a profit\nWill save that for a a for another program but those are the questions we'll have more to say maybe we'll have some guests on the program to talk about uh uh some of the questions [noise] question that came up at\nDinner tonight a while I was a while I was at home or eating was eating with a few of my neighbors is uh the question of whether or not\nWe are beyond the point at which we can save the planet from a from us and I thought I Would read an article from my uh progressive a magazine called toward freedom it's a progressive\nPerspective on world events since Nineteen fifty two toward freedom dot org and\n... the gay titled our choices matter more than ever before the race to limit climate change it is written\nThe release of a groundbreaking report as left the international community reeling over very real intensified impacts of climate change which will hit home sooner rather than later so what now\nThe inter governmental panel on climate change I PCC has revealed that the international community is severely off track to limit climate change\nAnd that we will see the world warm over one and a half degrees Celsius by twenty thirty if no urgent action is taken\nIt is quite discouraging to be told how little time we have Amnesty International policy advisor chi Ira look gory told I.

[laughter]\nComing in from elsewhere but uh it was interesting vibe I liked it reminded me of the area actually my home town there's this really hip street called ... and be on some of the road\nAnd we had a\nBoss and be like weather's cold music and where there were all the like\nYoung people hang out but I mean it wasn't it wasn't as cool as ... but it had a similar vibe but he was the first act he wanders this woman who was\nKind of pretty big and had like a\nLike a manly voice and was okayed singing and that was fine and she had her song eat eat to diagnose obey it'd be a dinosaur eat the people you're talking about that for a weird yeah she was just this whole song talking about how delicious people looked at as you want to eat\nThem [laughter]\nThat I thought that was kinda funny actually now does not bad but then the next act were\nJust so bizarre there was this woman is short woman must have been five foot two or something or was in this jumpsuit and she was\nDad like key key player\nThey they had a nice little instrumental like jazz kind of like repetitive thing going on but then she started like yelling and she had tons of distortion she uses sound effect the major voice sound all like four\nAnd everything [noise] she was like yelling at the same time\nUm so it was like muffled yells\nAnd then but then she made everything like really sexual so she was like dancing super sexually and like we'd go up to people in the audience and like and at one point you got this guy and she like forced them onto his like knees and hands and sort of like riding him\nAnd I was like whoa [laughter] and and she did this like every other song and then at one point Nick Nick and I were like okay we don't we don't want that to us but then we'll was in the front and then make like looked over me like we'll watch\nThis [laughter] this is your enough the woman came over and like pulled will and I have photos of this I have a video of this she pulled him over and then\nShe started like she started like riding on his leg and then she likes quieted down as like arriving on him and then and he came back and we're like dude [laughter]\nAnd he's like yeah that was really uncomfortable for me and I couldn't I couldn't tell if you if you really want to like it or not but I\nI I like to believe that he didn't like it but my first impression is that he he definitely he wanted that when that show a faction of the weirdest thing was that she was just so like so crazy into like\nKind of wild eyed like cross side she was on something I think why gave that impression strongly she was like using the microphone the the venues microphones like pleasure herself on the stage that was that was bizarre\nAnd interesting at least yeah better than boring and mad at you know it was at least just interesting in bed yeah yeah\nAnyway is that and I was like I'm going to get out of here and I waited for Pussy Riot to come on and they were okay and I was like I Need to get to sleep so we can leave early for the White Mountains to me yeah so\nYeah that was kinda funny um okay so now should we knew we can read the article for lead in the west one leader later\nI was a leader maybe its way to I guess it doesn't say your name during the ... set up to worry about it\nWell and titles OK guys this is late in the ... on\nA sudden blow the great wings beating still above the staggering girl her thighs harassed by the dark Web her nap cot in his bill he holds her helpless pressed upon his breast\nHow can those terrified vague fingers push the feather glory from her listening thighs and how can body laid in that white rash but\nFeel the strange heart beating where it lies\nA shutter in the ... engenders there the broken ball the burning Ruth Ann tower and asking them non dead being so caught up so mastered by the brute blood of the air\nDid she put on his knowledge with his power before the in different beak could let her drop\nYou put on her knowledge before his power did she put on his knowledge is power she put on his what does that well that's the one line that I don't quite understand I mean it's like talking about the ... right in the form of the salon mhm so I mean obviously he's like a very important figure mhm\nMm and so like my sort of there\nBefore he just like let her go without carrying at all\nDid she managed to get anything from I don't know if it's meant to be like Monday like manipulative or like ...\nUm\nMm Mm\nJust aligned like indicating his sort of status what's your favorite line from the whole um I like the description of\nHow can those terrified of vague fingers touch yeah\nYeah quite like by loosening five yeah\nI told you that I just quit like this pump because I read it and I think a few let my senior year no one would say yeah and so my um teacher gave us all this home and she was like now you guys have to spend ten minutes I think about it like just yourself and you can't talk to anybody\n\nMm Mm\nNo Florida you know never\nYou know sort of a deal but I remember I Know\nThe the no ... no\nNo not guilty but I Would never know\nI'm ...

Rob ... y has God made you so beautiful\nAnd then the um on job and I like the thing all the time I placate my beloved and then in brackets in different ways\n[laughter] yeah that's for sure Bollywood song yeah and\nThen when she is nearby warms me when she goes away the heart burns with which fire has got to meet her\nI kinda like that\nPoetic yeah maybe that's in translation yeah I don't know like I mean it's probably more poetic anything that uh I don't know I think it's probably less poetic really ... yeah it's usually more poetic before the translation well if it's a\nI I feel like if it's a if it's a song coming from like another\nI I feel like if it's a popular song is probably I don't know it totally could be totally could be actually okay so in the last line is so that she doesn't feel the heat of the hot moonlight all night I sprayed do over her with how many pains has a God made her\nWhat the hell\nIs weird all night I sprained do over [laughter] that is one [laughter] I've ever heard [laughter] I mean how does that [laughter]\nEverybody's going to run away when you are okay so this this whole just one line\nLike the ... and Jonathan line reminded me a lot of\nThe tide all aside song that but I really don't know how like the ... and I'm going to show you the part\n\nOver and over to our [noise]\nCaught a ball on how they ... they are they going to be\nThey are they they have a lot of them as well right about that but I Do love that they ... they will be a lot of ... ... oh ...\n\nOh okay there we go so\nWell if you like to order up a lot of it by the thing like ... sounds just like the this part I played um\n\nNo no\nNo no\nNo\nNo you know\nOh my God\nDo you feel that there's like a similar rhythm it's like perhaps but I mean it's sort of like the guy and us it seems like an obscure um\nConnection right like it's like vaguely similarly\nDon't think that's the you don't think that's positive you don't hear that\nIt's also a ... maybe but it definitely reminded me of this one yeah OK okay you don't buy that that that's an convictions okay uh\nYeah it was just I don't want to hear what you think of it\nSmall I\nKnow the man\nReally\nRange in a very brazen\nReally know I\nDo you ... do you do get that ... I\nBrewed you buddy bridges you need to get that John does he mean God oh\nBut you do you do that\nYou get that don't do them and you know\nBoth the\nA long\n[noise]\nHave been ...\nNa na\nI could

clearly not as good as you agree that clearly but definitely not as good at actually wait wait like you say not clearly but\nIt's it's hard to get a a clearly sense but also you listen to the other one many times and the only ones\nYeah but I mean you only need a year once I think I mean do you like you re read if you've read up a book five times and you eat and you read another book do you have to re read that book five times to to compare them\nNo but when I listened to my discover weekly I'll listen to it twice to see if they stick Mm\nWell if they really were sticky solves the first time would be enough not always true sometimes you're like doing homework or sometimes like it's just not as good the first time yeah\nBut um yeah I think kind of gives me like two thousands ... like yeah Paul vibe like kinda like John Legend oh my yeah or or not only catch Skeeter Hillary Duff for\nLike also kind of the sound very like senior hard yeah\nAlthough the instrumental is a pretty rough\nOn this if you if you didn't notice it was kind of choppy and I mean the made up an intentional um\nNo it's I'm pretty sure it's not he's like a Santa Claus [laughter] yeah I mean the scene\nWas really nice is a very yeah good sitting beautiful but it was clear that those were like synthetic instruments and then it was like him making this probably in my garage bad or some of you I think\nThat was yeah like not very polished 'em yeah OK so next we're gonna play nothing burns like the cold by snow ah like Russia do it\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nMain [noise]

I Want to\nDo would you rather would you do you like the cautious place on a lot\nYou can put anything else have you have it\nOkay also what what I did you first come across the song I really like it the song like that just played I think I think it was a discover weekly song and I think it is a discovery weekly type so 'cause it's like not that it does it does scare\nIt at I mean I'd never heard of it but I Know Vince Staples but he's not the main artist yeah that's true I've never heard of a lake or snow or rain or liquor\nMe in the the L my doo doo\nLa Hi Pat\nThe last ... ... how many have

knowing how to come back for being with somebody but not really feeling like you're there kind of thing right gosh yeah\nIt's like the I guess it's kind of like a modern fear though you know it's like if it's like distance it's it's I mean I I just probably always been around but\nIt tends to come out more we have less to worry about yeah but it is definitely I mean it's a real thing that all the isolation the sense of isolation from people around you even if they're people like physically close did you feel like that in France do you think\nI mean they just weren't people who were physically close yeah but you ... did you know the audience I mean no like last but definitely distant like everybody was far away\nYeah this is such a sad line you held me but you couldn't let you go to change me you held me in the east or mine still I feel lost I feel lost I feel lost I feel lost yeah yeah along for the night and I still feel lost you think the longing for the night is like suicide not necessarily\nRight maybe I don't\nKnow I I'll never forget for it and I couldn't take care of myself\nI don't know\nHow the first thing I think of ...\nVery much the song I listen to a lot when I was
