New York\nWas the era of the beat generation you know I met my\nAnd there were the beatnik coffee houses where Ginsburg and ... and others gave poetry readings which we attended so then I began to

beach Allen Ginsberg Gregory Corso\nWilliam boroughs when he started publishing books jak care or of course was interesting to me so but also the New York poets like Frank O'Hara and John Ashbury\nSo I began a school of New York city learning all the ins and outs\nI myself to the paper on a Frank O'Hara in college I remember\nYeah so O'Hara was of friends you know I knew him and I published some of his poetry in my memory a graph magazines and uh she was a friend so\nI quickly uh asserted myself and became friends with some of the people that I've viewed as my heroes such as Alan Ginsberg and\nThe poet Charles Olson from Gloucester I approached him and he accepted me as a young guy from the Midwest\nAs a friend because I was interested in some of the same classical themes as he was so anyway I\nJust followed the line in the opening line of Allen Ginsberg how I saw the best minds of my generation and I look to interact with those I thought were the best minds of my generation\nSaw the best minds of my generation destroyed by men\nLooking for an angry six angel headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo and the machinery of night\nWho

mining hundred diabetes message from the American diabetes and continuation\nAnother show that you are a part of actually with the floods was bill grams first concert production the benefit he put on for the mind to be managed yeah\nRight sixty five or whenever it was October sixty five and\nThat brings to mind that you played with the Jefferson Airplane and the murders of invention and you're often linked in people's minds with mothers Frank's opposite band was there a connection there between the the bugs and the and the mother's\nYeah we're we're always we're friends Frank Zappa and I met [noise] hung up on the figure that they played a Greenwich Village whenever Nineteen sixty seven they play one theater and we were folks were playing at another nearby and after\nThe show's would sometimes get together and So Frank was er during those years was first\nIt's been sixty five when we did a gig we did a Bill Graham first benefit you put together [noise] so I don't know we stayed you know the folks stayed with in LA with a member of the sap is ban anyway we were close for a few years\nHe were equally outrageous too and it came to um sexual or mansions and sociological or expression I don't know and you're all ugly Harry hippies I think you were the worst of the worst according to [laughter] some observers at the time\nYeah well you we started wearing necklaces when I grew up in the mid west as a close cut\nGood Missouri boy I Would never thought I Would ever were necklace but in the sixties I let my hair grow along and I grew war Annapolis and people were wearing a\nAfghan vest curve toed shoes and flowing robes and we thought people would wear a primary colors for the next six hundred years you know there was a drop off of the standard beatnik a tire of dark quarter Roy and\nYou know are raised and bongo drums and a\nTire so sandals for hippie attire that happen to ride around Nineteen sixty seven you know all of a sudden\nBeat attire was out you know racist sheriffs in the south would stop calling civil rights people you know dirty beat nicks and started calling him dirty hippy ... right so\nIt was all merchandise to the la yeah just taken up and and made palatable to the masses I guess\nYou know on television shows were\nBut there was there are cultural\nSituations that provide secret information to young viewers and they get storylines some information from something that's supposed to be an actress who but then there's like a subversive twist to it so\nYou can't put down popular culture totally because there are secret messages inside it for both ways you know secret right wing messages but also secret liberals ... even democratic socialist messages\nBut in some ways it's a co op patient and it doesn't that they might be a few messages in there but they're pretty diffuse I Would think after the uh the makers of merchandise or all over it\nYeah that's true you know there's a the almighty dollar lurking ups of head almost everything yes there is that\nJimmy ... let me give me\nGive me\nYour name and [noise]\n\n\n\n\nThere and you're and Ben\nAnd Ben's on the back row\n[laughter]\nMe me me in the ground\n[noise]\n\nOur LA studio and the producer was Richard older son and he had a four track\nLike the Beatles were by then recording in four track they they didn't go to this eight track till later on but in sixty six we were we had the technology that the beetles were using it for track and we were able to over the up and we did a fairly sophisticated album our second album [noise]\nThen by the next album which was put out by\nReprise records the third and fourth albums tenderness junction and\nAnd ah it crawled into my hand on us they were produced by all this and at his studio and we use wonderful musicians such as a Bob door oh\nWho arranged a bunch of you know he was a marvelous singer and musician then producer and he produced some of our best music on\nOn those albums we had a drummer Bernard party we use the Harry Belafonte singers to do backups singing on some of our song so I decided to a balance the quality up against what people expected the Fox kind of\nMulti layered set of songs so we did it that way and it turned out pretty well so the songs ten and the on tenderness junction and it crawled into my hand on us reflect this drive toward a sophistication\nI Want to mention a couple of things that I didn't a couple of songs we played because they came from the two albums that it was just talking about\nWe of course that long medley thing I was just speaking of ... we'll call it divine toe part why didn't grope need part one et cetera and as I said some of that came from the crowd into my hand on his sixty eight\nAnother one from that album marijuana we heard so religious in town\nAnd turn on tune in drop out from tenderness junction earlier in Nineteen sixty eight and that was panned by not just at Sanders but Timothy Leary All right here's a just one of my favorites off tenderness junction this is called the garden is open\n\n\n\nNa na\n\nI'm Glad they do it on a\n\n[noise] and then we for a final album on reprise Lubell that any way we we return to more\nRock and roll based sound so I don't know there was a good runner albums and you know stand by them\nI Would think you would you know I spoke to wink Kramer the MC five a week and a half ago I think and it was interesting to to talk to who I thought was your counterpart in Detroit because he was a minister and the white panther party Europe founding yuppie\nAnd you guys play together I Know what the Grande Bob right yes we did did you find common ground did you get to talk\n[noise] where we would hang out because John Sinclair was their manager and he was a good friend of mine and he and I went way back to the early sixties where we corresponded ...\nYou know we hung out a little bit and party so you know they always say if you can remember them you weren't high enough and that's one of the tropes of the sixties I guess yeah those who are who had arrived at [laughter] All right\nSanders truck stop I used Linder Ron stats band you know she ... Linda came and played town hall and I saw these\nMarvelous musicians like John where on drums and [noise] and I used to also David\nBrown bird and the other other musicians and then we did this album Sanders truck stop [noise] so I didn't quite give up\nBut I did I did a one of my ... was in an interview as Sanders truck stop was released I came up with the word punk rock\nAnd I was the first one that I said my album with something like punk rock and a that caught on so how did I Know I I never got royalties from Johnny Rotten but in\nTucson some I think that the sons were original proto punk rock yeah\nThere is that there's that a possibility is you know I don't know any way I put out of a mock country and western album called Sanders truck stop I listen to a bunch of Hank Williams and\nDave deadly trucker albums and Porter Wagner and Dolly Parton albums and came up with the sequence of songs that were in\nA mock country and western mode and put it out this album and we did we did a a photo shoot album shoot at a at a truck stop outside Bakersfield\nSo we're in the midst of the ed Sanders interview about twenty minutes left is that and wanted to mention the last couple of songs you heard were from the last album\nAnd back about Fifteen Years later eighty four I think and began to Second Life but we won't be getting into that on this show\nNow we're going to do a song from each of at Sanders solo albums Sanders truck stop ... from Nineteen sixty nine to start and then beer cans on the moon which is from Seventy two the interested in a couple of interesting things about these are both political of course\nThe first one is called the A.

listener saying uh I'd say\nIs a lot better than what you played last week but the truth is I only listen to half a song last week [laughter] if it's true I expected that from from some of you [laughter] uh yeah if you didn't tune in last week where we played was um\n[noise] some what I think are decent songs or some of them actually good from bands that you all hate 'em so if you go back\nTo go back real quick replacement spin doctors are holding the blow fish a gym blossoms\nThe Google dolls\nYou know you got you got the idea of what we did last week but it was a tremendous dive into the nineties upper some of you it was a\nBeat the as the inducing a dive but uh today we are um\nAre taking things back to the ... the nineties or when grants came around I've done a grudge show in the past so it didn't feel like it was a as immediately necessary um\nIn what I think is a we're looking at is what happened after ... popular uh because uh here in college radio\nAnd more on indie rock um or what was to become indie rock um you're John burned hearts of the world started signing up at that point and ah the this kind of grants allowed aggressive alternative rock\nA music kind of was left to the to the higher frequencies on dial 'em\nYou know I I it's it's still GOOD Music and that's why I'm examining\nSo right there in the first time we went through the big for a big for his uh at least in my mind there's two genres that come up when you say big for the first one is a trash fresh metal a with a big for being Metallica Macbeth\nSlayer and anthrax or that's the most common agreement and then the big for a kind of like advertisement or was used for the the big for Seattle bands that were coming through\nIncluding a Nirvana Pearl Jam Alison chains and sound garden pushes ah exactly what we listen to in that first set\nAnd the funny enough\nOr I don't know funny enough\nOther to banks that broke biggest were Nirvana Pearl Jam and they both reacting in a similar manner they both hated it and they both wanted to do something completely different first dog we started off there was radio friendly unit ship there was of course is\nA a kind of like a sarcastic title for a song or\nFrom there in utero album and are Nirvana has a lot more feedback a lot more noise than they usually happened there's long a name purposely\nOr try to sound as a as\nOff putting as possible a\nJam the way they reacted with the the became they adopted a lot more\nWith uh the first of all them ten and a was both versus and uh my tall gee I told you be in the ... album that we played a day they really started going off the ban 'em there's what they were doing a savings bad because I found that we listen to their um a lot more just an cords and\nArrangements\nOr sign garden on the other hand they hadn't really broken and yet so super no one was a huge of him and uh from Barry played she likes the prices they really experimented with a lot of things on that album or from the drumming um and that the phone I'm\nVery different from the um or other not terribly different still grounded in ... but it there's a lot of stuff that\nUh is different than\nWhat the grown son was originally were originally was that's what today's show is a grudge music a question mark things that fit or don't fit\nInto what we think of brunch anymore I'm laughing at us that was from Allison chains they took um I don't know if if expected approach or by the Mets song they went a lot more southern um and they had a lot more ... going on\nAnd yeah just making their ... sounded a lot bigger but Alison chains are definitely always was grounded in grants\nOr never they never lost respect with their fans I'm a big influence actually I'm a lot of parents to come\nSo we're going to go to the next set and these are bands that are\nTruly actually that come out after brunch broke or some of them just because it just missed the starting line as some of them because of the\nThey were recruited not long after it or the one that I think it serves the most merit is most ah frequently overlook\nWelcome to stark solid albums and a response from their second one purple other closer called kitchen where I
