things cannot and will not occur\nBut unless we act about that and make the connections I Know that it's not necessarily a moment where some people are up for or capable of making those connections\nBut I Hope that when time moves forward a bit we can make connections that's why I ... for about the shooting in\nCharleston South Carolina I'm Will Hoge about guns and Charlie King about

relation to a mass of starving and terrified Honduran folks fleeing mess\nWho are seeking asylum we are are responsible and must engage in our own ways\nYou're listening to radio interview on WNPR in Cambridge my name is mark stern the views and opinions expressed on this program represent those the participants they do not necessarily reflect those of the staff the management of WNPR the technology Broadcasting Corporation or am I\nShe says they a brief piece from Juan Cole a that was from common dreams of this past Wednesday\n\n... the pieces is fairly direct and to say the least the disclaimer applies to this I have a nationalist\nDonald Trump apes Mussolini and drive to destroy America that's the title [laughter] October twenty fourth is the date Trump proudly says he is a nationalist he is of course saying this to shore up support among white nationalist\nThe Nazi sites on the Web we're all having what dreams in the aftermath from the Nineteen nineties polling has found that about ten percent of Americans support far right militias\nThese are the white nationalist Trump came to power by mobilizing their ten percent combining with Republicans and independents\nIt is not an ask an accident that Benita Mussolini called his party\nNationalist fascism the two go together Trump performs the fascist part of this two part term every time he does a rally so he doesn't have to say I am a nationalist fascist I eat a Mussolini us but\nDebates and this is an aside on my part\nUh we've been talking about Trump and Mussolini on this show for the past two years a long before the election and will continue to do that and that's where this is coming from anyway back to the article\nSomehow the needle Mussolini is not often brought up dumped in contemporary American political debates his army slaughtered three hundred thirty thousand allied troops during World War two including large numbers of Americans two of my uncles fought in World War two and the European Theater and I'm not willing to let Mussolini skate\nA forty five thousand Italian Jews eight thousand were delivered to Nazi death camps in a similar number were forced to free of lot abroad some one billion dollars was stolen from them as a community\n\nI'm not sure how Trump's rescued and Steve Bannon got away with praising this mass murder and then being invited to major cultural and political gatherings in the west and wants to get another aside a Trump himself used\nThe language of Mussolini and a defended it later on now back\nThe air menial funds on a two thousand sixteen article explains that the big industrialists in Italy formed a nationalist association in Nineteen ten their policies and actions in the subsequent decade helped undermine deliberately Italian state Fonda rights that they were anti liberal\nClerical opposed to any improvement for the lower social classes and favorite expansion ism at any cost most American industrialist today cannot be characterized this way but a fraction of the business class here holds these very values and Trump is their example are the only\nMussolini forged links with elements of the nationalist association during World War one when he broke with the socialists over their insistence on neutrality\nAnd alerts to the far right of militarism his new fascist party received a good deal of money from the unsolved do arms manufacturing company just as Trump's increase for military spending it's intended to attract campaign moneys from us armaments firms\nWhen he turned against socialism which upheld the welfare of the working class Mussolini substituted nationalism and he said the nation is a history of sentiments traditions language culture and race\nConcerns of welfare for the workers and the poor he thought only arise among people that has not integrated itself into its proper linguistic and racial confines\nRace language national identity exhausting and imagined people and it's a glorious history contrasting with hatred others this was the heady brew Mussolini substituted\nFor attempts of workers to unionize or to limit their work hours were abolished child labor was of course a cruel illusion that the nation was undifferentiated and unified by race\nAre about\nChange the room who\n...\nA new\nLakers and\n[laughter] I'm\nNa I'm a one man a man and a white man's world\nWhite

one first on your app him darn\n\n[noise] [noise] Hi my name is Lucy and I am one broke me ah my name is Ryan and I'm the other broke me and we are the two broke means and you're listening to eighty eight point one WNPR Cambridge\n\nYup you're still listening to eighty eight point went W\nToday his name is ... yeah Wilson Syrian how're you doing\nI'm doing well first time on the radio so I guess this is my uh big debut\nYeah oh my goodness so how you feel and how was your week\nI was pretty good um midterms at MIT this week for a lot of students so that was pretty rough but you know the weekend comes get some rest and ready to start the next week\nYeah so what kind of stuff are you interested in or what do you want to study\nYes I Am planning on studying computer science I just like everyone else at MIT I guess [laughter] but I also have a really strong interest in in political science or it's more of an interest in something I plan on studying though\n\nOh yeah yeah yeah that's really nice yeah or points for safety [noise] number one [noise]\n\nMy name is Ken Field and [noise] [noise] yeah so I Wonder what that was kind of confused yeah so\nI'm a computer science major too so I can totally relate uh-huh what kind of classes are you taking the semester\nOr some in some pretty introductory classes a physics multi variable calculus or and then also uh somewhere that I'm just interested in like a American foreign policy and then a computer program in class and uh another computer programming class\nYeah and what's your favorite part of MIT so far\nI I feel like this is pretty typical answer but the people are pretty amazing oh it's just really interesting to see everyone has their own passion in getting to see everyone pursue that is pretty fascinating so I think there's just a lot of benefit from being able to see or other people will pursue something they're interested in and learn from them\nYeah so Wilson and I both live on ... to ... which is our living community\nI think\nA couple of months ago and it's a it's a it's a suitable replacement for home I think there's a there's a lot of great people there and it's it's nice to have a living community that you fit into and I think you might do does a really good job of making sure that you you find one to fit into\nSo yeah that's really true I guess like I found someone like my best friends on counter to yeah infer encounter um but yeah anyways it's been a really good two years I feel like I've learned a lot here I don't know if you learn to live here maybe yeah\nStarting but I didn't already feel it uh I guess it's called the fire hose so fire hose of information always learning so\nYeah I'm so right and I well my co host Ryan and I we've been out and about looking for some interesting stories and I guess just interesting stuff to learn about and I'm an issue that's really caught our attention this week\nHas been the lawsuits against Harvard concerning affirmative action\nUm so yeah we've been just like talking to a lot of people and just like learning a lot about issues in our community\nAnd so we you've stumbled upon two very interesting people and like two rather different people um so this is Wilson and Wilson has something to say about affirmative action if you'd like to say some\nSure [noise] so I think the Harvard law suit is is pretty interesting it's a one of the ... like most renewed uh attacks against affirmative action and I think it's interesting because it takes place in a very different context and then pass lawsuits ah\nLike the lawsuit against a University of Michigan or a lawsuit in ah Texas this is because there's a specifically concerning discrimination against Asian Americans and so I think that\nOf course of affirmative action is to to try and ensure a diversity in the student body\nAnd so it gives colleges leverage or to use race in order to ensure that diversity however I I just [noise] what we've seen with Harvard using affirmative action I just think shows that are affirmative action has failed to to meet its own objectives and that it's a\nBenefit effectively been used to discriminate against a minority group in college admissions and also it doesn't seem like Harvard truly has a commitment to diversity in their student body because they have legacy admissions are about twenty five to thirty percent of their income in class is legacy admissions\n[noise] and and then you know a lot of stuff happens for a trial and it's all the background the lawyers get paid a lot of money to do very boring things are and and then the the fireworks happen at trial so the trial started a on Monday October Fifteen I'm a little less than two weeks ago\nAnd it was scheduled to last about three weeks and uh you know\nIt's always hard to tell if you'll be exactly on schedule so um\n[noise] but it is shaping up to to uh be about that time frame\nYeah it's interesting um so you mentioned Fisher versus Texas yeah I'm and I'm also that buffer in these cases surfaced out around the same time yeah I'm Still way is like the main distinction between Fisher versus Texas and the current case against Harvard\nLegally I'm so well first of all Texas is a public institution and Harvard private um so that a lawsuit against Texas proceeds under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment\nI'm and because harbors private or this lawsuit a proceeds under a title six of the Nineteen sixty four civil rights act a so title six um is a contract obligation it says that if you take federal money\nYou can't discriminate on the basis of a B and C and among those things is a race\nExactly the same there's maybe a little wiggle room but there is actually saying\nI'm In this case a\n... in both cases actually brought more or less by the same guy or end bloom is a conservative or an activist as a fair word and I'm In both cases he organized the fund raise he made it happen\nAnd he wants an end to race conscious affirmative action or re admissions policies\nThat was the relief or the that he'd requested in both cases\nI'm I'm not super familiar with the Fisher case um I ... I Know that once the Supreme Court twice actually oh wow I'm the first time Supreme Court said you base your decision on the wrong test or standard and they sent it back to the Fifth Circuit and said you know use this analysis like\nAsking these questions\nAnd then the Fifth Circuit re decided and then the Supreme Court to get back up and they ultimately ruled against Fisher\nUm I'm not entirely sure why but I'm also UT has a very different missions to see than than um Harvard UT um I actually grew up in Texas I Know a little bit of out of a [noise]\nThere's a um top ten percent program so if you go to any public high school in Texas and he graduated top ten percent of your graduating class\nOr you are automatically admitted to UT\nOver time this has been reduced slightly like hop eight percent or something just to so that\nUm because he doesn't want to remind you of students to to be from this program they have something about a third of their classes kind of what you would consider regular missions where people read your application you know they look to interviews your test scores whatever they're the ones that just\nYou know you get it because the state law\nI'm and Harvard obviously\nAnd hard and fast rule [noise] I'm definitely um so what do you think are the chances of this case reaching the Supreme Court are there people who are far more learned and and the experience than I who are um\nYou know who who almost washed the Supreme Court for a living and tell people what they think it's going to do [noise] uh I\nCan't really say it was very much confidence I think though that this is the kind of case that is designed to reach Supreme Court the Supreme Court took up\nA very similar case twice or that was filed by the same guy I'm this is a contentious and very public um law trial in lawsuit let me see a big name defendant can ask for bigger name\nAnd um gifts or the ... and other difference between fish would be Texas and it's not it's just kind of the political valence right it's a lot harder to challenge affirmative action with the white plaintiffs\nThan it is within minority plant [noise] um\n[noise] and uh I mean I wouldn't I Would I Would\nI I personally think based on not very solid you know what do I know I'm a second you're lost and I think I think it's more likely than not I think it's probable that the Supreme Court will take up this case they have a five I'm\nFive conservative judges now and they will have open season to do with affirmative action as they want 'em to the you know concern of many um people who support affirmative action so\nI don't I I think it's more likely than not yeah that'll reached\nThe Supreme Court and so you think if if it does ... Supreme Court what do you think like this new conservative majority would do\nI have no idea I mean I I you know ... again there are people who go you go judge\nOh the kind of contentious fights over the the recent nominations of Gorsuch or justice Gorsuch and I'm just as Cavanaugh\nI'm I I mean I I got there there are people who you know they like went to school at these people you know they like to play sports with him on that we go golfing with him on the weekends or whatever I I I mean there are people who who can tell you a much more credibility in surgery then I\nGot to go meet Kevin I'm placing you know yeah you know [laughter]\nMaybe one of these days ... hours away I'm from ... a fellow Harvard does end up losing this case what do you think would be the implications or college admissions like across the board I mean it depends how they\nLose so the\nI Will say that I I think it's very unlikely that harbor lose this trial but of course this either way this case getting appeals on up to the second circuit and then up to the Supreme Court um I mean Boston is a Harvard town and uh\nEveryone in Boston has a Harvard Connection in some way or another cousin works there went to school there or whatever [noise] um\nSo I'm On summary judgment which is ... I'm\nKind of a a step up before the trial um all the facts get laid out and there's no surprise that trial you know what they know and you you and they know what you know both sides\nUm and then based on that both sides um can apply for some reason judgment which is I'm basically saying the facts are clear there's no need to go to trial to decide um we have enough information\nUm and I certainly judgment that the judge presiding judge Alison boroughs said\nUm what the plaintiffs are asking for and it just a straight up and to race conscious affirmative action policies\nBuys um that's not up for debate what this trial is about is whether or not harbor discriminated against Asian American applicants and um you know a ... you know envy impossible world this case the heart religious the trial and just not appeal [noise] um\nWhat would happen is that you know so a sitting you know assuming that they lose that means that the judge finds that Harvard do discriminate against Asian American against and it would just mean that Harvard has to change their\nUm admissions policies now of course this means that pretty much everyone in America has been weak they're admissions policies in some way or other\nUm and and the judge will hopefully offer guidance on on what isn't is not okay but of course these are you know nationally contentious questions and and again\nYou know this this case going on [noise] um so on the\nOn the small version of the case you know the low stakes side\nIt means that um affirmative action is here to stay\nHarvard you know made some mistakes they they have to tweak or maybe totally changed their admissions policies\n[noise] um but uh in order to fit in within the appropriate affirmative action's parameters I'm On the large scale side if this is a um you know if if\nIf more is on the table um it is possible that affirmative action is gone but I think that it's politically very unlikely to happen so\nUm [noise] those were the kinds of two ends of the spectrum\nIs and so we're we're this case to be decided in against Harvard do you foresee like emissions policies only changing in elite universities or\nNo cost them more [laughter]\nSystem or they were the first ones um and you can read the history about it or to go ... away from a test scores based system\nFor all over Spanish speaking\nAnd so what did you to think about it\nI thought it was a pretty interesting perspective is definitely a lot more of a like a legal background looking at it and um\nSo I thought that was it was pretty unique to be able to see like from a legal like scholarly standpoint how this hurricane shapes up\nAnd I think he made a very important distinction between the case as it stands right now and the potential for the kids go to the Supreme Court and so while this brings up a lot of conversations about preventive action as it currently stands this case is essentially only about whether Harvard discriminated against Asian Americans\nAnd there's not really a case about affirmative action as it currently stands but definitely is shaping up to be one that has the potential to go to the Supreme Court\nYeah so I'm so based on like um I guess just discrimination against Asian Americans like what exactly do you think about this lawsuit like is there one side that you lean more heavily towards or like less heavily towards\n... [noise] well I think if the evidence comes to show the Harvard husband discriminating against Asian Americans in of course there shouldn't be a remedy in order to ensure that\nHarvard does no no longer use you know discriminatory language or procedures towards Asian Americans however I Would not like to see a change in policy such such that affirmative action effectively ends\nYeah I think like affirmative action overall is like probably good you know because it's good to like allow people to have more opportunities um because like if you're a historically like this if you if you've been discriminated well okay maybe this isn't the best way to start this a phrase but like\nI'm like if you face hardship before in your life like you obviously have it had like the same amount of opportunities\nAction overall is good um but sometimes I just like feel a little bit strange whenever I talk about you know privilege and like Asian is you know um because I guess like Asians are a minority\nI'm but sometimes I just like really wonder like how much are we discriminated against like do we really faced the same amount of hardship says like some other minorities\nI guess it's situational you know yeah yeah I think it's hard to distinguish for an entire group of people based on race yeah you know of course there's like way you can say is happening historically but you know it's kind of hard to say for the entire group to make a generalization\nYeah and I think that that applies to affirmative action overall because it's hard to just say that like based on your race you know these were the conditions that you faced growing up\nExactly yeah and so I I think that's\nI think that's an important aspect of this case it was like what should making a diverse class look like oh should it be based on race like how'd you how'd you implement affirmative action and I think that's like more of the nuanced question\nI think this case of less about whether or not affirmative action should exist just more about the specifics of it like should should Harvard be allowed to ... in their view increase the diversity of their class at the expense of another minority group\nUm I think that's like one of the more specific question that comes into this case yeah so I think that the Supreme Court should just if this gets to the Supreme Court the Supreme Court should provide more guidance to schools on how affirmative action looks like in practice\nMhm and I think that like it's especially complicated for a social group like Asian Americans simply because of like the diversity of experience in Asia\nIn like because like there's a very wide gap in terms of you know\nThe incomes and like I guess like the backgrounds of various Asian groups you know you have some agents that are significantly lower on like the social economic scale than like\nOther Asian Americans um so I think that like just because of the like just the diversity of experience it's hard just like to pursue like a policy like overall that generalize it's all Asian Americans\nThat's very true you know especially when you were by filter my nationality you do it you know what it means to be like Indian American versus Chinese American versus Vietnamese American you know very different experiences\nYeah it's just very different so I'm very interested in how this case plays out um because I was an Asian American who had to undergo the college admissions process um so I guess like\nI did and face a sad ending because I'm at MIT and I'm really happy um but I've definitely heard of like you know some some of my age and classmates you know thirty six on the ACT just like absolutely perfect applicants you know you just don't know what else they could have done\nAnd they didn't like end up at an institution that they wanted to end up that\nYeah that's true mhm and then in the end it's hard to say like is that discrimination you know or is that something else\nRight because then you have to also consider the fact that perhaps you know past a certain point you know like objective qualifiers ... objective methods\nYou know become less important new like oh between like a thirty four and a thirty six you know\nYeah kind of a wash like kind of yeah and also because I guess a lot of people get rich\nIn American applicant like rate statistics are different from like most other groups um but in the end like someone's always going to get rejected cell and like the pool is it's so big\n[noise] exactly you know no one's going to get what they want in the end yeah we'll just have to make sure that the there's no systematic structural discrimination yeah\nYeah I think this case it was very important as because it shows the just the facts themselves and the admissions process in you know to the public\nAnd so before it's just kind of based on conjecture like oh you know I Know so many people who are rejected and they seem like perfect candidates well now we get to see like specifically what Harvard their what their mission process looks like in a kind of get into the details of why maybe they were rejected\nAnd so I think that this case is going to do a very good job of bringing all these questions to light\nYeah for sure well we have quite a few weeks I guess potentially before this case gets decided and like probably a very very long time until it reaches the Supreme Court so I guess like maybe\nNext year I think my like come back and talk about it more before now is this another case that's moving up its way\nIt's just a case like reach the Supreme Court right now we'll see what happens we'll see what happens yeah anyway um our guest Wilson here he wanted to discuss a little bit about Saudi Arabia before we leave um how would you like to start\nSo uh recently in Turkey or the Saudi consulate a journalist who was formerly in good standing with the royal family of Saudi Arabia had since the left or to move to America he had gone back to the consulate in Turkey to uh yeah I get some legal documents and\nUh perhaps the Saudi Government or Saudi operatives or a it's kind of unclear right now but I somehow he was killed and it looks like the uh operatives had ties to Saudi Arabia and so this brings about kind of like a a crisis for Saudi Arabia\nAs it it it appears as if um you know a ... a journalist and you know of course free presses is an important American value and should be an important national or international value a journalist has been killed and ah Saudi Arabia is facing the consequences of of what that means\nI'm wow that's quite a lot um yeah we're seeing\nLong term changes in Saudi Arabia's relationship with the west [noise] yeah so this is a this is a really pivotal point in Saudi Arabia is relationship but the last because Saudi Arabia has had a growing ties with the\nWith the U.S and other western allies and so it's kind of a interesting to see during this pivotal shift towards\nA growing relations with the west is just kind of very damaging for that and so you know recently Saudi Arabia has been trying to open up to western business in in foreign investment and that seems to have been going well and um but you know with this with ... with this whole incident ... about the same time they're supposed to be a big a conference for western businesses in Saudi Arabia\nUm but then a lot of the people that were supposed to go there decided not to go because of the this recent uh incident and so this is kind of bad for Saudi Arabia is international image and ties with the west and kind of\nBrings back up those questions of is Saudi Arabia are ready to have strong ties with western nations because there are some there are some pervasive issues in in within the Saudi Government that\n[noise] no
