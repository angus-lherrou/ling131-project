I hate the gay people and I you know I uh [noise]\nAnd um so that was that was that was something and uh so so it was like in the street walking with time do you like you know but you know gay people out you know humans and you know they you know they have two legs into arms and you know maybe you should respect them um until she basically told me that her ex had dumped me ... had dumped\nHer a for a guy\nThat that probably explains it so anyway that's slowly unrelated um so are the point is after that I was a little reluctance to to continue things but I still did it because I'm In\nAnd we continue may we were like pretty much in all the bases that you can imagine and then she essentially less meat in front of her apartment building\nSo yeah [noise]\nSo anyway um so that's how great um and so um\nAnd so the thing is I came back to my home and I was like\nDamn I don't know her name um\nSo I Try to like look for on Facebook and all that they couldn't find anything\nAnd I was like ... you know crap I I I kinda would want to\nBe no see her again chief who was interested in me and that's sufficiently ...

just don't know playing something from atoms for peace which is Tom York's\nCanals groups ... band with people for a few other and\nOnly person I can remember besides ... who is in the group is natural ...\nThat's their song before you're very eyes which has a really stunning use could you\nAnd\nHas a really cool message I guess because you watch it and you're like whoa [laughter] it's a symbol [laughter] but\nYeah of course that song sounds similar to a Radiohead song which is part of the reason why I like it and in particular it sounds like that comes off of the king of the limbs\nNo no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo me\nVisitor a song from astronauts et cetera from their album ah\nAstronauts etc\nActually know the a woman's not called the other one was called living in simple yeah and I actually saw them perform that song life I think they did that song when I saw them but\nThat was towards the end of the summer and it was it as like nice small room kind of and there were opening for the Mets into so I was excited about both the opening act and the\nMain act which was always really sweet yeah that's definitely\nOne of the most memorable shows I've seen in the past like year I guess [noise] um but I definitely really recommend that album and\nThen the song that was right before that was\nThe base of flowers from the holy drug couples who originally came up with an album but that's actually not from their newest one\nThat's from there one that came out a couple of years ago called soundtrack for punching now and I actually don't know if that's really the soundtrack to anything\nBut if it is\nA movie I Would watch [laughter] [laughter] oh because it has GOOD Music obviously but it's yeah and then before that was fluffy cause Mish\nNo no\n\nNo no no no

live\n[laughter]\n\n\nYou have another thing to chemistry when one you end up ... in Cambridge and I'd just be the song from pond called O'Donnell\nFrom their album hobo rockets\nAnd that song I really like how it's kind of almost like over German [laughter] and\nI look a lot of his songs they're not taking themselves too seriously but they still sound amazing and I play that because Paul and will actually be here in Boston in a couple of days\nOn Friday nights and which is extremely exciting they were last year\nLast year in April I think and I did see them then but this time should be a whole different set of songs because they've been home looks new material and I should maybe be\nMore of a larger show if they've\nGot more fans and all this time but it definitely one of my top I don't know like five bedrooms of all time which is really saying a lot [noise] so\nAnd then before that um was song for ... see from I'm Jim T from the album congratulations for some reason\nThat's pretty much of all time and I was in the kind of dusted it off and have been listening to it again after\nKind of ignoring it for a while and yeah I've just been reminded of how\nIt's in my top a looms other [laughter] oh [laughter] like a few years ago I used to listen to a lot more of an election having high school but I still think it's one of\nThe best ...\nI've ever listened to him [noise]\nYeah and of course trying to play more stuff from it I guess in the near future oh it's it's definitely there\nI got like I said it's the rest of them in my opinion but I feel like the the least talks about and I don't know it's like it's so severely underrated\nUm which is a shame [laughter]\nAnyways [noise] um and also yeah I saw them um\nI saw their concert\nMonths ago earlier this year and they look one song from that all of them so I was so mad but\nYet and before that was when I see you again from trips sides and then off the rails from the new twist so I guess now I'll play\nSo now it's extremely rare and people but it's a virus would change the global food endemic could occur\nTo what should you do to prepare for an outbreak offended if\nMany of these same things

recently where Laura Ingraham the host\nWas railing against the diseases that these immigrants were traveling up from Central America primarily hunters and Guatemala through Mexico which has been a target for President Trump and the Fox news network in recent days\nShe complained that these people would be bringing diseases to the country and I reflect simply remembered in history\nThat the Nazi Party targeted the minority groups that they were trying to demonize\nWas pretty much the same kind of broad brush saying that they carry diseases and lo and behold I looked it up there it was the whole history of the Nazi Party a accusing various minority groups that were being persecuted by the Nazis as a carrying disease so\nFox News to our page right out of out of a history here a very dark history\nIt's a vicious history at the genocidal history you know it it it much better to use a hard\nA word to describe this history and in fact if you go online and look up the sturm or a kind of records that was the Nazi newspaper and look at the language look at the pictures look at the characterization of Jews um they're not just disease carriers they bring socialism they bring rape they bring\nAll kinds of money manipulation so we're basically now looking at people like sorrows and seeing a direct historic relationship to the accusations against sorrows George Soros with the Nazi movement of the Nineteen thirties\nThey basically announced they weren't going to talk about the name of the shooter in Pittsburgh they weren't going to talk about all these comments from political people they're going to stop by naming the victims\nAnd I think that's really what has to happen we we spend so much time on the mainstream media talking about um names facts killings blood or and then we go to a cut to somebody who has a political or ideological point of view pontificate ing right you know pulling it out of their bug\nAnd and talking about stuff they know nothing about\nAnd all too much even on the left media now you have people talking about these kinds of actions and what promotes them without any knowledge that there's fifty sixty years of social science that explains all this in detail it's yes they've said is that isn't on the Web it doesn't exist\nIn the context of what we're living through right now in extremist hate the racism and bigotry and the violence how important in your view is this midterm election coming up November six and repudiating the politicians and party that seemed to be promoting and advocating such hatred\nPlus the two step process that you know I obviously I think it's time to take power away from\nA very bizarre set of authoritarian and self reference from Republicans who have taken over the party there's a a really four or five different sectors of the rights that have United to support Trump and and the current libertarian\nA kind of greed stir agenda but also very masculine is also very um anti kind of intellectual so I think we need to elect\nDemocrats not because we think they're going to solve the problem but because you know we'd like to be able to have these conversations in two years rather than all being you know sitting around in a camp somewhere talking about the river\nNow that crucial and that's going to be by electing Democrats but that is not the solution in the long run when they'll the solution in the long run is to start organizing resistance to all these forms of authoritarianism and bigotry\nThat was chipper lay an investigative journalist research analyst an activist who's written about

Lula da Silva on dubious corruption charges\nWho polls indicated would have won the presidency again if he'd been permitted to run\nBrazil's lurch to the right with the election of both in RO follows the rise of extreme right wing politicians across Latin America Europe and the United states you're a reporter spoke with Alexandra main director of international policy at the center for economic and policy\nGo on social movements that have vowed to challenge his all summer terrain agenda\n... out of the equation you had no sort of major popular figures in Brazilian politics that could sort of take on both the neuro who did a good job as posing as a complete outsider I'm as not being corrupt as someone who would help clean up Brazil\nAnd in a variety of ways\nVery aggressive rhetoric torches left wing adversaries that he would jail\nOr forced into exile or an even at times is threatened to execute them a labeling others as terrorists and so on\nBut one further point which I think really needs to be emphasized said it's interesting because people like Steve Bannon the actually praised the boss about campaign um I'm good story point which is\nThat they were very successful in spreading all sorts of this information about that about the rival candidate from the workers' party through social media primarily WhatsApp which is very heavily used in Brazil\nEspecially they had an army of trolls putting out all sorts of fake news in a very very effective way they manage to reach millions of Brazilians and much of what was put out there was taken at face value\nAlex both narrow is elected office and a pledge of many repressive and also our Terry in programs that he intends to put in place tell us about the checks and balances\nIn Brazilian system namely the legislative branch there were elections for the legislative branch is well known for his rented the elections I Believe in the workers' party as I understand it will play a prominent role in the Brazilian Congress\nWell I'm Scott not necessarily because I'm while they have more seats than any other parts\nThere's no single party that has a majority in both in our thirtieth actually second or it went from having\nLiterally two or three or numbers in the Brazilian parliament for having fifty to a I think to the Workers Party I Believe they have around fifty seven at this point but um you have many many parties and and actually when you do the math\nOr you can see that the right has really the strongest coalition in the ... or what is assumed will be the future coalition\nIn terms of um the broader checks and balances including from the judiciary and so on\nYou know let's note that do the show is extremely extremely conservative or has shown itself to sort of been playing the partisan role against the workers' party and its various corruption investigation and you know there was a good chance that they will soften up to both ...\nAnd should they not um there's a real threat from the military I think\nAlex tell us about the social movements in Brazil that had been very active and pushing a progressive policies and\nAre working with the the former incumbent party the workers' party in raising the standard of living for millions of Brazilians how are they likely to react to a bus in our president said\nWell they're reacting very badly and are quite understandably famous for Saddam pro or just last week\nOr labeled some of the major social movements including the ad that she has\nA land was workers a movement and\nAlso the M.

um that this is the first time they are here together\nSo it's exciting I'm different errands yeah [laughter] very special\nUh occasion um yeah so uh today's Halloween I'm very fortunate to be having my show tonight uh\nYou to like Halloween yes we're like Halloween oh wow yeah\nAre getting married right around Halloween next year so that that stigmatize on my true like yeah and you are actually took your engagement photos in a cemetery right they did ... [laughter]\nI actually just uh I was at work today and one of my co workers showed me her a wedding photos mhm and they were in anywhere else in a cemetery um but it was great because it was like the wedding dress a and the like and he's in a suit and they're like wind down and like very like identical oh\nLike wedding photo kind of way but it's like in front of two old tiny like\nTombstones as a married couple and it was pretty so and if you ... so if you need ideas [laughter]\nWe didn't go that intense I tried to make sure that we took as many photos in front of trees and flowers so that my mom would be happy [laughter] she's not like totally [laughter] I think\nIt's a great place to take beautiful photos about things that are happening get closer to them like oh\n[laughter] I didn't want to tell you that you know he ... he took the the the hand signals here in the station and they're not universal [laughter]\nI'm just\nA cool place to take I mean senators are so beautiful and you know you get the nice memento Maury element of it mhm thinking about you know your life as a permanent\nIt's part right so ... works all always yeah um yeah so how did you guys dress up at work at all today for Halloween I lost my teeth I was going to be a vampire\nOh you off [laughter] like where you're going to be out in the chipmunks or something [laughter] so I I wore my shirt with owls and I was\nLike spooky nice that I give kids candy so\nI'm so upset I all I wanted since I moved out of the dorms as to like give candy to trick or treaters that they've never come to my house and then today I and so we didn't get candy this year because we're like we're just gonna end up eating it and like we don't eat that will have enough from you know parents who are at work like bring better leftover candy\nUm but yeah uh I pulled into my driveway and there is children at my door\nFor you [laughter]\nI was fortunate yeah I was pretty devastating [laughter] um but I don't know how long has always been pretty great uh I was trying to I was trying to think of like what my favorite costumes growing up have been\nUm I definitely you know had that a stint as a kid where you're just like a cat for like six years and the way it should be like another six [laughter] um I was never a cat really which definitely but not a cat I I have a\nCat now but I was not very interested in cats and I was a kid so that would not have been a coffee onto the [laughter]\nWhat about you David like I Know you you grew up like moving around a bunch who did Halloween change depend on like where you were\nYes definitely um 'cause you know trick or treating very different depending on where you are so sometimes you just go to a church and their candy there were other times you go up and down different driveways and get all the candy or sometimes you're just stuck on a military base and they usually do\nIt's one that stood fans out here um I think it's super weird being in a city right now and seeing people trick or treat their businesses like that stands out to me that's super different yeah\nThat's actually a question I got because someone wondered if a on friday when we're doing our costumes on friday at work because we had um demos and wanted to look professional [laughter]\n[noise] oh my God herbal was for evil verbal yeah I think the the I think like whatever you're making light of the draw of being kept them alive I mean it was probably a traumatic experience [laughter] but\nBut I mean who knows like maybe like all the dark energy like entered the spirit and the dog was like finishing the cleansing of the well anyway so that was so they they I don't know which of the houses like this cleansing took place in but\nThe house that she lived in and her parents still live in and that like I Would we would do some of the parties at\nA a woman died in her bedroom like the bedroom that like my friend has a the woman who previously lived there died there a and there's like one of those really creepy doors that have been like wallpaper over\nThat are wrong in her bedroom and so she's like she's like I'm not gonna touch that like [laughter] I Know enough to like not\nNice with that so she has like a bureau in front of it\nBut you know she's like seen like flashing lights like in the corner of the room sometimes she's had like things like be written on her on her hand um when she wakes up in the morning\nI'm cheese while like doors opening and closing things like that I never experienced anything anytime that I'd been there but it was definitely having known those stories and then uh when they got their addict finished uh we would do we would sleep there and we would sleep in these little attic\nLike rooms I had no windows and so you close the door ... and it'd be complete the pitch black like there was no lights or at all um\nAnd just go on living in places like that without being too scooped she's\nI think you're going to it like to change she she's the friend that taught me to love a horror movies ... of a specific kind like the other stuff I won't touch but um\nBut yeah like ... that was our thing like we would do summer parties even not on Halloween we watch a scary movie and then top it off with sex and the city like Dallas [noise]\nI Do that very often [laughter]\nUm but yeah she is that's very in line with\nHer um with like her style mhm that's cool I don't want to visit his house yeah again it's in coral Gables\n[laughter] I was curious I was like is this the house for some woman was killed but I think she was killed in the kitchen and I'm a bedroom so\nNow I'm not the same house I don't think it was murder either I think she just died okay with that of old age but a theme spooky stuff is going to have any ghost stories\nI'm not really I usually tell my uncles story of going to the board in house and um while he was there he uh felt this like scratch on the side of his stomach\nAnd like hot it was his sister\nMessing with him while they were walking through the house and she wasn't behind him so he was like oh that was weird and um when he got back to the hotel fall on his stomach go there like three deep ... scratch marks oh\nThat's kinda the only little story that I have though I once stayed in a hotel in the thirteenth floor\nBecause of spooky things superstition yeah there is I was in Canada I maybe they just don't believe with that and the candidates like we get rid of a perfectly good floor [laughter] um yeah there's actually there's a word for like the fear of the number Thirteen\nUm that's actually reminds me it's it's a ... I Can't say it's a very complicated like ... ... just because something something phobia\nBut um but yeah I\nThere's a lot of stuff I was trying to think of stuff from like Nick at our like my family's from like what's the precision existed there and uh there's a lot of superstition and my family because um there is like stories of like my grandmother who is now passed that she would have a dream of someone being chased\nBy a bowl and then like later that week that person would die oh yeah\nAnd then that that would ... allegedly happened like ten times over the course for life and like I remember this one particular him\nA family gathering that we had I mean on house and my grandmother was there and my cousin was there and we like confronted her about this and she was like yeah that's true and my grandmother is not the kind of person to lie and uh so that was a kind of that was an interesting\nA revelation [laughter] like family history\nYour family do any uh like small practices that maybe are sort of aligned with which you know like my family didn't do this but I Know of people who would have rights the name of somebody who had wrong for them\nLife or something and just throw it like in the freezer like in a jar in a freezer and [laughter] you know like I don't know my mom's told me stories about like going back in the freezer with like\nYou take him out or is everything good with him now can you been up to be dissolved [laughter]\nLike our freezer is overflowing now people people that we have everyone on their life on your on your list out from under headless [laughter] it's so funny you know I we I didn't I didn't have anything like that my mom has joked that she's um she's a wedge before because she like\nReally wanted a we had I guess I was saying at our house and she really wanted my sister to get with [laughter] you know like matchmaker mom's style and but he lost that night and then and she was kept you went to bed being like oh I Wish I Wish like he wasn't leaving and then like plain guy cancelled than he had to come back or something like\nI Wish I did I did it with the power of my mouth [laughter]\nBut um yeah I don't know I definitely think it's like a you know my Jake my fiance but you both know um\nHe's very for someone who really loves a like he's currently in the Halloween show at in Boston where he gets murdered you know every showing 'em and so do basically everyone else on this is Gore fest for anyone in the area who\nHas ever attended um you know it's very Halloween very like you know\nSpooky like\nFall into the into the festivities of the month I'm for all that like he really doesn't like supernatural stuff like I remember David you told him that like a story and he just like did a complete ... he was just like like [noise] like what like not just\nDoes not engage in that kind of stuff which is really funny because um it it seems like he would like it because he likes like Toy Story telling and that's what I kinda like about supernatural stories is that if you let yourself kind of like magicians for example like obviously there's a trick and there's a way\nKind of believe a little bit it's way more fun in my opinion and trying to poke holes into it a lot of people kind of a fall\nInto that same category as Jake go or they're they're really into it but the second that they hear of maybe a first hand account there like\nNope I Can't deal with the navy being very own [laughter] yeah I mean it is true it's like if your entire world where your entire world view and like your understanding of how everything works is suddenly to be like you know pulling from underneath you\nThat is that is a lot like it's a it's kind of a lot to kind of a stomach like\nI feel if I go story would even be more believable if I said that it had happened to someone else and I just heard about it secondhand\nMhm 'cause it's just really no\nBut oh I Know someone who knew someone who saw ghost that's like oh yeah tell me more\nTime [laughter] like it's more like as in people are more willing to like participate in this story about suspend or disbelieve yeah if it's because they're like pilots probably not true 'cause it's like a story of a story of stories but all this in any way but if it's like if it's your a story like nope nope you're crazy [laughter]\nYeah I'm cool well I'm going to\nListen to a or I buy I mean all of us aren't going to listen to I put a spell on you by I don't know if its eyes are IGA but uh she was a the song was featured in the chilling ... Sabrina Spelman which it on Netflix and I'm very into it\n[laughter] so I Hope you enjoy the song will be back right after this\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAs he walked beside me it smelled like dust and old would that high in the house the boys tried for certain though even though the moon was scarce\nDo you know what store you're going to tell me to put me to bed he asked like I said it doesn't actually have to be scary\nNot really maybe you could tell me about this evening tell me what you did\nThat will make much of a fun story for you my girlfriend she just moved into a new place on the edge of town she inherited it from an aunt or something or someone it's very big and very old I'm going to spend my first night with her tonight so I've been waiting for an hour or so for her and her house needs to come back with the wind and Indian tech away\nShe said the boy there was that precocious amusement again that all kids can be inseparable sometimes when they think they know something you don't it's probably good for them\nYou know all that but you don't think you just such a brain filling the gaps he pushed to open the door to the attic for him it was perfectly dark now that the opening door disturb the air and I heard things rattled gently like try bones in than bags in the flight wind\nClick click click click like that\nI Would have pulled away then if I could but small from fingers pulled me forward unrelenting me into the dark yet\n[laughter] the old came in and stay with us favor yeah it's so good he is very good so that makes sense\nI'm a fan and you heard that one before or brought up before and I gave me the chills [laughter]\nAdding this to if anyone wants to keep a tag along on the the play list as well as being less for tonight I'm gonna try keeping track of some of our literature as well and track\nUm oh who wants to go next sure so I have a problem that I wrote when I was in a creative writing class in college um [noise] this is a palm uh\nThe the dead because our assignment was to write a bilingual palm so I'm incorporating washing Spanish um and it's\nAt the last one of those I when I lay in the last thing Neal has been on all the alternatives are covered and who get this economy Los do for us the death of a child's can be forgotten for a moment is to know what you are listening you return\nYou know centers gays on mommy and Bobby confused by their quote bulls bitter sweet reminders of their separation\nIn the world of the dead it is easy to forget the power of media and familiarity I went on a and the other little so the

with the other two of those cars or a day of the dead um my family doesn't celebrate that but ah\nHave you ah have you ever celebrate it out yourself or like I had friends that\nUm I haven't celebrated myself my cousins are Mexican American and keeping Americans or their dad is from Mexico so um\nYou know I've kind of like second hand\nHeard of things um I guess a little bit closer to them like watching a movie about it or something like that are just seeing photos [noise] um [noise] but I've already I've always been really interested by\nI think this is a kind of just goes along with my like Halloween obsession like day of the ... with the fact that I'm Hispanic\nHas really appeal to me with their traditions and and stuff like that like I really want to go and experience it like in Mexico um\nBut yeah my family doesn't doesn't celebrate it I just really like a\nAnd I mean I really liked the I really like the the idea and intent behind it out to be a lot of how you wrote it I Love the St Louis like using the both languages\nSee yeah lots of good uh Halloween content definitely\nWatch that tonight if you're not doing anything else um\nWhat about you did and he said he
