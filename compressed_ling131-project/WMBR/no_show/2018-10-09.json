your piece a which is a time release the first movement of time release um\nBut I wanted to ask you how has a performing I'm musician how that alters your approach to composition I Know that a lot of composers or don't perform um you know I I happen to be a composer who performs or my own music and and it it does affect\nI think how how I treat music and I'm Wondering what your perspective is on that\nYeah shorter I definitely have you know a A N for me I mean I don't I didn't always perform coming up you know in the eighties as you know having an instrument or as kind of\nOut of a fear of classical music as as the guitar was I kind of repressed my guitar background and I was late to so called classical music so I really through myself into the whole notation that whole thing and it was only you know\nAfter grad school that I I returned to the guitar I'm first just kind of a competition will tool and then you started including my\nIt shifted my focus from having my music live on my desk or on my teacher's desk\nOr to making it live on stage making it really try to try to you know go out project to an audience so I think some things are\nUm a subtle things in the big things about but the music timing the music timing feels very different when you're when you're playing it um I mean you then when it's rattling around inside your head and you're just imagining it um I think now my music you know takes more time I started writing longer pieces that\nThat took more time with the ideas when I started playing um ah\nAh for sure and materials certainly\nChanged because um as I started playing the guitar more um\nThe physicality of the guitar influenced the material more where you know I went to grad school at Brandeis so um you know the music I learned to right there on just one paper\nUm didn't didn't take into account of the physicality of of any instrument um and and particularly the guitars\nSo do you think that ah ah you were you know your experience as a as a performer and the physicality as you say a is something you can translate when you're running for other instruments that you don't play\nI salute absolutely I think probably the the kind of peace I've written maybe more than anything is is I'm a ... concerto so I've written a lot of can share those and I and I enjoy that I I'm interested in in virtual city and various\nYou know in you know in various shapes and and um so I I I enjoy collaborating with other so\nLewis a on you know whatever trumpet in this case on ought to be my country is gonna be collaborating with colon um I Know what

that they might be giants on they were kind of all my bucket for today because um [noise]\nUh they they started off in the eighties and even though I'm also you know the stuff in the nineties [noise] I'm kind of especially in college radio or the yeah they got a head start before things company often [noise]\nBut uh the reason I did play that at the beginning is a kind of as a amounts to a wonderful for a bee Jay's who just recently left the country are as many of these just end up doing a hero WMBA are um you know MIT produces a lot of a\nVery very successful people who go on to do many great things around the world [noise] um and you know we're\nThe last four years and uh they might be giants is the only bands that we really had in common in our\nIn our show um something that we both got locked up in the past but uh that's the only way they're about cryptic encrypted you all doing goes out to you or not that you're no longer here\nAre physically you are most welcome to submit your request for the for those of us who are the are\nRight we're going to be on a first a song for the fish will of the show is from ... other than sonic youth a band was fingerprints\nAre almost everywhere next want to call sugarcane\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nUm\n[noise] and [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nBusiness in my email from them or anything\nAnd I'm ... now now\nAnd then when you know\n[laughter] [laughter] [noise] and [noise] bad [laughter]\n[laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\nAnd na na na na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na na na\nIn their time and\nAnd there's been under God and\nAnd and I've been up there in\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] looking back everybody is seven twenty three and a you're still listening to\nAnd they're hooligans here on WNPR\nIdiot but one of them on your ... uh let's see there's got to read\nKarl ... you know what we've been listening to\nSo uh we started off a ... with sonic youth or a ban the um\nI guess now within like pretty much immortalized for what they released in the eighties uh especially the album or they do nation but\nAlso um you know other conflicts as well like evil\nAnd sister and\nThen later on that negative released grew\nA which already showed them I'm leaving they drew nation already show them going in a more acceptable direction or but that right there was from their album dirty that came out of making that he too\nOr an alternative rock essentially going mainstream and with our co Kobe and being so good at a\nLot of people know who his influence is worth a band like um you know sound like you've been a me probably isn't a lot of a lot of the guys are going to be putting today or he let people know hey these are the Manson I listen to these are the banks you check out stopped checking me up\n[laughter] and uh that works to a certain extent a sonic youth or a you know they had hits of their own uh\nAnd they gained her own following a sort of the nineties\nSo they they traced isn't pretty well I Would say\nAre right now in the back and we're listening to us from them called the diamond seat\nOr off of 'em are washing machine or all of them so I think is the most hilarious album covers there's um [laughter] but uh let's see we'll tell you it will also be listening to [noise]\nSo uh you know pick these obviously one of those other bands from the United states that are really set things in motion or in the late eighties\nWith their quote unquote abrasive brand of pop 'em and the quotes I'm a rather play or something from Frank Black because a pick these much like I have a lot of those bands from the eighties just\nHappen to a break up uh in the early nineties just as things were a really come into ahead in terms of a\nBreaking through the Frank Black went on a solo career as well as from teenager of the year and the ... the founder replay was called freedom rock\nOr a song that uh uh I like the idea in the ... more than anything else are you you're not familiar with the term freedom rock freedom raw food it's\nCall a basically he'll be music or freedom I'm [laughter] kind of like a tongue in cheek an opinion or maybe the prank black to throw in some humor in either but uh the last time we feel we're looking to there was a dinosaur juniors\nWave a feel the pain or and\nThat is what Judy you're obviously also another one of them just as you got to do on these all these bans were are\nEssential to the nineties alternative saw sounds of a repeal of being a came out in Nineteen Ninety four on their album by the sound and then ended up being a their biggest ... I'm Still probably the most popular song\nUh there's and Jay math is actually a he\nOr math is honestly don't know how to pronounce his last name he produced a lot of albums that came out of the early nineties I'm going to all of them but uh just through some of the stuff that I Will be playing throughout the next hour or the rest of our um was produced by him\nLocked up we got something from the readers or the other a major player in ...\nI'm not not to be a ... um [noise] yeah um [noise]\nWhat's it called yeah when I saw from the readers is called Invisible Man you're also go straight answer [noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd on and [noise]\nAnd a\nDay and I have a\nA\nBig\nNa na and AA\n[laughter] a\nAshamed day\nBut a\nNa\nBig thing [laughter] just\n... there was\nAnd the la la\nLand but then in the west side\nSide and I live in a big thing in\nF\n\n\n... ah you're still a big issue [noise] oh that's weird that should not have happened or you're still listening to tend to vote against you and they'll be MBR idiot when one of them on your Dial M was with you today is David Mercado ... if\nYou if you want to be which it about it um [noise] let's see I Believe that these are some ... going to be something in the background of just just just want them to do\n\nAh so a lot or go through what we've been playing if you are just tuning in\nWe are are playing bands from the eighties or bands that we mostly know from the eighties are and how they are dealt adapted to or the nineties um middle of a sudden the people were interested in what they were doing a and by people I mean [noise]\nRadio stations other than our own [noise]\nUm [noise] as an example here in Boston [noise]\nSort of go through and let's talk about it [noise]\nUh we started off that set with the breeders a ban headed by Kim Deal and uh her\nIdentical twin sister Kelly deal so if you ever see a ... a picture of that band\nAnd uh you know a\nEarlier before that we play some Frank Black or so there's a Boston too far right there uh we followed up with ...\nWhat were the St you in the background a but a from\nTheir monster all of them lost their album it was a song called let me and wish I kind of had a similar field to um\nMost of the automatic for the people all of them except that it was um [noise] it the album monster is where they decided we haven't done rock in a little while like straight ahead rock so they they went full fledged guitar\nOn that album or a lot of a lot of a feedback and just noise all over the all of them but but it's nice it's so nice of them of forgotten um and\nAfter that was sugar sugar sugar\n... and I think I mentioned about are you I'm ... I don't really know if they fit most of the other bands on here because uh they were already popular they were one of the first alternative rock bands to break through the mainstream or so they were a if anything they they didn't need to adapt anymore because\nThey had already\nChanged things\nI thought that was with sugar a sugar\nA band that was formed by Bob mold or from who's going to do or\nThe the band sugar with\nA a song called a good idea\nWas from the album copper blew\nAn album that actually\nAnd then a from their most famous album was the lemon heads dilemma has is probably the one that really kind of thing\nAnd I had a similar similar thing going on at the school of them were played a couple of weeks ago um but\nYou know either way Lehman have they have a good enough following the underground\nIn the eighties like eighty so they can make it through\nIn the summer there was called rather less\nLike a like a boat without a runner I'm\nAnd we're never going to go on to our uh last that I Believe or we're going to start it off with a throwing the uses a bad also from uh the local area from Rhode Island and the next song is called bright yellow gun\nUsed to make sure I just got everything set up correctly yes we do let's keep going\n[noise]\n[noise] she saw age [noise]\n\n[laughter] [noise] and again and added and added manner and [noise] [noise]\n[noise] yes ma'am ma'am\nTrack [noise]\nJam\nAnd try and [noise]\n\nAnd\nWhen he does a user\nAnd ... will be able to put food on the news\nTheir own\nAnd their\nParents and then [noise]\n[laughter] good afternoon my name is more blue [laughter] and now the mayor [laughter] the mantle and was\nAnd the\nGuy Haley's\nNa da da da da\nWas in the mirror going\nThere and on the on\nAnd the more [laughter] than the mom and\nMorning [laughter] and the Taliban to believe that the\nThe [laughter]\nThe the ...
