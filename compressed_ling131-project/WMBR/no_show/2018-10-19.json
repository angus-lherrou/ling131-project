and very rarely do the two moments explicitly come together especially on the left 'em or if you could indulge me one more second on this\nOn tape I'm often times one big part of the non ... off the off the list is the whole nonprofit world which off\nTo the Nineteen sixties seemed to expand there's different arenas for the may have to be active in and you know often than I think that is the union movement expanded both those traditions is a a a um an emphasis on\nClaiming our victories at the same time unfortunately as necessary is claiming victory is there is too little uh\nFiguring out how we can try and send them and as such we need a space and so we think that in ... interesting can be one such space\nIn addition and a sort of reflected in our calendar or you know India before the Trump election there were many many meetings and events that address uh topics around\nPolice brutality and addressing police violence in general\nAnd relate to that than to mass incarceration and then they started structure of the country and it consisted in that period largely of organizing meetings very few organized reflections on both\nWhat we were asking for and uh I don't know if St similarly right off the Trump was elected there were countless knee things out spaces open practically twenty four hours a day ... well within well within the limits of operating I was but it was regularly\nTo organize meetings and again very rigid political reflection and so I think in this moment we're we're looking at organizing more events that are deliberately about perfection and I'm thinking through where we are and where it is we'd like to go\nWell thank you sir and I really appreciate that are suffering response to Michael and questioning\nAnd explaining a very important fact I think about the way that organizing works in the way that theory works but I I Would also add as much as people and organizations in England just seem to reflect on the troubles that we've seen\nAnd it's also played a a place for celebration which makes you very much about what the organization is about but\nIn Chinatown was on the floor which is how it got its name and then ... over over the years it has seen a lot of different emphasis I think right well what do you how would you characterize the\nLives focus of the organization beginning in through now\nCame up with the ad or some nuances to to that the comments which is a very accurate summary of a trajectory um one we have a rock solid foundation in a number of a race didn't organizations\nThat are focused on and have remained focus for that entire period on the topics that concern than the most so for example people advocating for single payer health care remain\nA sort of at the coughing quite interesting coat similarly people arguing for uh the rights of immigrants and for open borders that is from Maine to punch this than a emphasis of people working out of incremental cinco\nUm there are number of other similar parallel courses including empty Wallach although that is somewhat receded\nSo when we were founded in two thousand and six\nAre a number of organizations were very active are opposing the war in Iraq and in general the u._s. wars of aggression or talk to not only in the middle east but elsewhere too including multi touch and read today or Venezuela\nSo I'm so for example the Venezuelan solidarity committee operates out of including for cinco so given that we're sort of a poodle and be composed of many different projects groups or we can identify lines of continuity and secondly I Would\nAnd it's related to climate change both in terms of mitigation adaptation and I think that's more recently there's a lot more focus on it\nI'm In ... uh and then over the last three years and it was pointing out there is a lot lot more organizing activities and meetings\nAre and now they're not a few more sort of public ideas relate to things\nI should also let you know that we have um [noise] I I just do projects that I sort of personally been involved with the two co authors\nAd that's been run out of an interesting co its feet are researching and writing a book on Boston called A People's guide to great to Boston and we in [noise]\nIn um [noise] on July first ah finished\nLast a draft of the book and sent it off to the publishes from in ... um the reason that's interesting to see is one proceeds from the book will eventually or from the royalties will eventually come back to ... is one plus ... because ... financial sustainability\nSeeing the book as well but the book reflect on the last four hundred or so yeah there's\nA lot of cities it's we all legions history on these organized in terms of a hundred and sixty different sites or across a great to Boston area that speak to people struggles as well as to the people who make those struggles necessarily\nMainly the global and historical one percent\nSo um [noise] that's another kind of project operate out of an interesting 'cause that's new to us and different from when we were founded um and in fact on October twin seven\nHold I'm the first ... co sponsored walking twelve downtown Boston\nTo yes UMass Boston classes as well as for a number of visiting a community groups\nSo what are the locks where what area okay take\nOne part of bike by\nI make I didn't get the name twelve blocks we want to suggest that you know actually any way you walk in Boston and\nThey all people his we used to be told in this case Steve organize our particular venture coming up on October twenty seven or as talking to a very close to ... street station in fact\nAct in ... cinco than walking out along cream launched towards government sent it to court street\nDown ... street to ward Washington on Washington back towards Thomas treat\nHim he would have complete to twelve blocks and in those twelve blocks will come across historical person but that snitches like Frederick Douglass was employed garrison\nAnne Hutchinson and um [noise] as well as organizations like fake community news or um [noise] um the Boston watch in one society something that ah [noise]\nUm I guess similarly we are now becoming more deliberate about and this is kind of late making sure that the conversations that happen I think we're seeing co are recorded at online in one form or another mhm [noise] yes\nWell this is it's hard to do it's hard to keep that in an instant peace but nowadays it's important because people can access it that way if they can't get downtown Boston but I'm Still ... is there anything else you want to tell us before we go yes you\nKnow um last week we'll hope for wonderful it then called the movement of movement spoke with a new role and it speaks at it's based on two books edited by a guy named Choi soon\nUh that has a much in the in the two thousands\nAnd uh it's two huge volumes of very interesting to rate it works or edited works\nAnd um [noise] as a consequence we launched a out of hosting choice in and engaging in a conversational theme we've launched new website called movements of movement stuff met the movements of movements dot net pull the trigger content\nFrom I'm from the book as well as on ... where we engage like this a cross that fairly broad in that ... they're a\nSpectrum and it will be an international conversation very much inspired by the wealth social Florida process but other political processes that have both a pre dated the well social for them and and now continue\nIn the in the sort of um golden yes of the of the well social for him so that that's another exciting and they ... that we think uh well sort of engage the well sort of ideas have the wealth of activism\nReminds me I meant to ask you about your book twelve blocks of Boston when did you say coming out and who's published\nOkay so the University of California press has the books in their hands in their hands right now so we anticipated will come out at some point the twin ... Nineteen I'm so\nExcept that fits the book's title is A People's kite too great to Boston\nSpace on a series of books that the University of California press he's preparing a one nice being published already that's called A People's guide to Los Angeles though they're similar uh volumes are in the works right now I think the folks in New York finished their blog and just before I always\nSo it has been making some exciting series\nOh that's great yeah okay that sounds terrific so I've been speaking with certainly are ... and ... and of course the website is eat and see you eat and T R O numeral five dot org that's not that easy is are nice way to say that\nThere is no [laughter] and it's interesting though and a certain thank you so much for some time to chat today\nThank you Linda thank you for keeping this program ... about the long distance runner who we want to thank you\nThank you and you are listening to what's left on W.
