know\n\n\n\n[noise]\nNa\nA tea yes yes we shall we love the holy transportation\n'em and Julie I Want to hear a little bit more about like your previous women's marches experiences are protests that you were in that you like that you didn't like\nYes ah so I went to the women's march both there's been two so far and I the day before the women's march I went to a separate kind of a makeshift protest with my sister which I really liked ah it was in Chicago and we stopped traffic going up lakeshore drive which is\nThe community that felt strongly about\nUh the ... of our current president because the town I was from didn't have a lot of people that seem to care that much or we're happy with the current situation and then the next day went to the women's march and the first year the women's march with super cool because I'd never experienced anything like that around been apart either but yeah\nSo it was cool to see a but definitely um we're talking about this earlier that the second year uh they developed the intersection analogy of the event because the first year it was more uh like white woman empowering white woman\nAnd not a lot of different communities of women were left out of the empowerment\nFor sure do you want to talk more about that in terms of like I guess we both like comparing [noise] it's funny that you mentioned that he is looking back at it\nLike I could see that um it was very like white women focus but I always thought I guess because like Linda starts to her was one of the main organizers I was like oh they have someone who's like Muslim and who is your job like it woke like [laughter]\nYeah so the founders of the women's march is a really diverse group an intersection holiday or something they thought was really important to them but I think the first year\nA lot of people took it as an opportunity for white feminism and a law didn't trickle down it did not trickle down and there is a lot of trans exclusion okay people with like the ... the China's trade hair true or not on the air out at the march\n[laughter] um but yeah now\nSince I've been planning with them that is one of the biggest focuses of the organization\nOh definitely after the first march it was hard for me to hear that\nBecause I think I was blind to the fact that it was like a lot of communities were like ... yeah excluded because like as a white woman I was like wow that was amazing like that was super cool and then like to realize like there was like things that we are going wrong that I'd been blind to\nMhm um yeah it made going the second year like a different experience what did you notice about the second year compared to the fact\nUh I notice that a lot more speakers like so much so that like for three hours they had different speakers that were\nDisabled trends a Latina just more I got to hear a more weight wider range of perspective that the first year I think I only heard like a few speakers\nAnd I think the speakers that year and the the second year really emphasized like what made them who they are and their individuality\nMhm I'm which helped unify such a diverse group of people I think\nYeah and I also like that it's this movement outright like I feel like the first one was born out of just like straight resistance to ramp and the first one is very much so focused on like\nLike yes it was all about like embracing yourself or whatever but it was also like oh this is an opposition to the inauguration this is very much so like\nA like our move like playing and now it's just like oh where women embracing women all this stuff which I think is important for young children to see for young girls to see and for older women to be reminded of completely agree I feel like\nThis is something that kind of turned into just a snap shot a moment in history in two thousand Seventeen\nBut\nAnd what are you like what how is the process of organizing your women's march going right now\nSo after the speak out in September I had some of the women that spoke come up to me and say you know there was no Boston and no Massachusetts chapter of the organization and see if we could start one together so I've been talking with the national team\nLately about signing it and we're going to plan to have an open house and December okay to gauge interest in the community or trying to get all of the\nDifferent universities involved and you know all these groups on a grassroots level of Boston\nOh so so do well\nAnd Juliet as a member of the greater busting community and as a woman who enjoys protesting and whatever um what is something you would like to see in the Boston this loss in March yeah um I Would definitely\nI'm excited to see because I'm new to Boston I'm excited to see I'm just like meet more people within the community and I think it's cool that um [noise]\nWe're like they're working towards getting different schools involved because I think that'd be interesting to um meet people through that and just meet different woman in a city that's new to me\nThat they um okay I think that's awesome guys well Sara best of luck\nThe rest of your planning please let us know how we can help whenever and\nI'm excited to be has type resisting the longer you know I Will January twenty first resistor sister or is it might be the nineties it could also be the Nineteen Eighteen and check your calendar

these guys created a huge increase the deficit all every economist said this was going to happen they said oh no no no um but they did it as a reward to the donors have been supporting their campaigns\nAnd sure enough we all said okay they're going to this is their playbook they hate Social Security they hate Medicare they hate Medicaid because these are programs that American people overwhelmingly support at work so well and they were a manifestation of government at its best\nSo they are out to destroy all three programs and sure enough before the was even dry you had Marco

last week Mitch McConnell said the same thing and my concern is\nIf this is what they're saying a few weeks before an election they're going to be so bold and if they retain control of the government so people who care about Social Security Medicare and Medicaid\nReally must vote and they must vote democratic because the Republicans are out to to get these programs\nNancy maybe could speak to what's at stake in this year's been term election given the fact if Republicans retain the house of representatives and continue their control of the U.S Senate and the White House under Donald

your worst fears in terms of a continued GOP control\nMore worried now that I ever have because the very fact is\nThat if they are saying they want to cut these programs before the election they will know the twenty ninth team there as far away from the next election as you can get 'em and they have no guarantee that they will retain control and twenty twenty of the White House\nOr Congress and they will be held bound to ram these cuts through no they tried in the last Congress you know there was the vote over the Affordable CARE Act on the pre existing conditions that really it was just John McCain um the late John McCain as everyone knows that famous\nThumbs down that that had very serious cuts to Medicaid in it and they talked about also undermining Medicare's funding they've already been tried and they will be emboldened we will have the fight of our life on our hands and I don't know we can stop them because\nWe got so many distractions\nThat they will try to push this through in secret in the dead of night and we will try to get the word out but if they have all branches of government they will control the news and it's going to be very very hard you know for lots and lots of reasons we have a system of we're supposed to have a system of checks and balances\nAnd if Democrats take at least one house of Congress\nThat will be a check on this legislation they can still do things with mental strain of Lee and they're trying closing field officers making it harder and harder to access benefits\nWaiting forever on the on the telephone if you try to get through to get information and so forth and we need to fully while the Social Security administration to do its job and not this death by a thousand cuts but at least we can stop legislation and then when we get\nA supporter of Social Security in the White House we can turn\nYou know they are going to go as hard as they can and will be very hard to stop that was Nancy Altman president of the group's

verdict true reflection of the public's political choices\nSince two thousand ten two dozen Republican controlled states have enact laws making it more difficult to vote\nPrimarily targeting poor minority and young voters most likely to support democratic candidates\nMassive voter purges in Georgia Indiana Ohio Colorado in other states have shown a harsh light on another form of voter suppression tactics\nRepublicans claim that more restrictive voting laws are necessary to prevent voter fraud but dozens of studies have confirmed that the GOP charge of massive illegal voting is it deliberately false narrative designed as a rationale to suppress the votes for their political rivals\nThat twenty Thirteen Supreme Court decision in the Shelby County versus holder case effectively good at a key provision of the Nineteen sixty five voting rights act\nThat requires nine states with a history of election discrimination mostly in the south to secure advance federal approval to change their voting laws\nAfter the high court ruling these states quickly enacted new restrictive voting laws many later challenged in federal court you're a reporter\nProgressive magazine article titled how voter suppression impair owes the midterms the sheer variety of voter suppression tactics\nCombined to start to weigh on would be voters and discourage them but there are a few things that stand out in terms of um tactics and one of those is just more laws and twenty four states have stricter voting laws and they did in twenty ten\nSo these laws are going to be in effect this November and this wave of voter suppression laws\nTracks basically a backlash against the administration of President Obama elected in two thousand and eight to America's first black president so we have a variety of laws\nThat have shortened early voting they've uh introduced a strict\nPhoto ID laws they have limited student voting even on a for college kids requiring proof of citizenship that something that we saw Kris Kobach attempt in Kansas where he's a secretary of state where he's running for governor\nThat onslaught of laws as a remarkable considering the fact that\nSo many of them had been passed since the Supreme Court ruling in Shelby County versus holder which we can the voting rights act and that seemed to open the gates wider for these kinds of laws to take effect\nAnd I think the other thing that is worth noting as the effort by particularly red states to purge voter registration rolls it's a normal thing to clean up your roles when\nBarry hyper aggressive and unfair way and uh the Brennan Center which is associated with uh the New York university they've found that between two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and six team that\nA state's purged from their voter rolls roughly sixteen million voters and that's the thirty three percent increase over the number a purge between two thousand and six and two thousand and eight\nAnd purging ah increased more in jurisdictions that had been subject to the a voter Rights Act of Nineteen sixty five in terms of\nHaving to get federal approval to change their voting laws that pre clearance mechanism of the voting rights act was essentially eliminated\nIn a Shelby County a decision by the Supreme Court in two thousand Thirteen so the purging activity is is greater in those states and those jurisdictions that had been on a leash you might say with the voting rights act\nTo fight back against some of these restrictive voting laws often dreamed up to deprive particular demographic groups of their right to vote garbage referendum that are um on the ballot this November and legislation to\nTo allow same day voter registration universal registration and make sure everybody\nIs on the books to to cast a ballot\nAnd also independent commissions that would be constituted to draw district maps or after the next census so that they are not drawing in a very partisan way that locks in the Republican Party which has been the case over these last ten years that had been locked in in various congressional seats\nFollow us on Facebook and between the lines radio news magazine and dodge litter and be detail

I I yeah I did that yeah let's let's skid\nHow to ride it was yeah it was too many people [laughter] it was\nIt was I I actually had had trouble believing that so many people were out on the rise because they several hundred fifty people if you've never seen that many people on bicycles on the street that may not sound like that many people that you know that many bicycles to be out but if you're actually\nIf you actually they're watching all those bicycle drive by it's kind of seemed like a long bicycle parade is is\nPretty incredible sight to see how do you how do you how did how do you know what\nThe best place to take seven hundred and fifty\nYou know rowdy issue I Would say exuberance ... a good word for it and and cheerful share of the Halloween spirit mood\nHow how do you do like how do you like your plan or to what's what's the process or\nSo I I think it you know looking at the you know this ... been going on a number of years so we obviously have favorite areas and favorite streets that just sort of work a bigger streets are a bit better so there are so there's space for the for the bicycles um and the participants\nUm streets were maybe um\nYou know where there's a lot of people out so that uh\nEnergy the energy the energy from the people walking down the street you know mass have is great for that I'm a Coolidge Corner a\nMouse and my favorite is downtown crossing always so many people walking around downtown coughing downtown across the aisles of people yeah and because\nTall buildings next you kind of ... like this almost like we know music\nChamber that you're in and you can gather everybody to gather in\nAnother son is you're you're carrying music trailers now yeah so you blow blasting awesome tunes right\nYeah and then that that I mean the first year that I went on the ride two thousand five there were two people that had music attached to their bicycles on ... on racks and then about halfway through the ride they put it out because the batteries didn't last long enough and\nAnd they weren't that loud and with technology improving\nAh you know and now you know you're not strapping an iPod to a using ... and and this and that and you know the the battery power has has improved so there's at least a half a dozen people with\nLarge sound system being towed on bicycle trailers and it definitely is it definitely adds a whole new level to to these bike rides\nYeah I'll have one behind man you know your own or a music journalist ... ...\nIs gonna be she's she's got to be there she's got to be out front this year\n[noise] ah my first gun when I first Halloween right but my first up front at Halloween right now\nWhich is going to be leading the ride with the music so is it is going to be great and uh and that that's that that's one of the thing I mean I Can't not\nMention all the people that have volunteered throughout the years and all the folks\nThat are helped out whether it be a large or small role and even the night of the ride you know people really come together to help each other out um and to just be you know be there and having fun but also to to you know be safe and to and to be there for their\nIn what how can they volunteer\nSo those are very good questions so the original website Halloween bike ride dot net ... tea\nSo how do they live\nSeriously this is an old school website that guy up there\nThe other um a couple of years ago so it looks a little fresher um but there's some old pictures on there which are fun and so I'm In ... I'm also there's a Facebook event page you can just do Boston Halloween bike ride a search that Facebook and you'll come up with the event page\nAh and again some more information about the ride if anybody is interested in volunteering um they can ah send a message through the event page\nUm and there's there's also a a flicker page and there's a link to that off of the uh website so you can see
