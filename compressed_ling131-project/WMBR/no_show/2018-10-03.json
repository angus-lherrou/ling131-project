to be here [laughter]\nAnd the other is Bob how's it going Bob it's a wonderful oh yeah well you're you're Mike is not on so can you repeat that one it's a wonderful and I can can you be closer to them right now are is that close enough for you I think it's close enough for me were also joined by a laugh track\nA let's calling Alexa and [laughter] and a wonderful sense when you're adding\nUm so yeah so we just arrived in the studio essentially we have no idea what's going on except for the fact that I'm In good company and we have records that we want to play them that we have no idea how to play them and\nWe're just happy to be here essentially\nHappy that you guys are joining us on this lonely lonely\nI'm Sorry a lot of crying no I think they're asleep [laughter] I mean I accepted Ukrainian sleep or something but I don't know do not I mean I don't know like do you have a day in these grants that to share me personally yes no no you know I actually got a very well it's odd\nIt's been a long week so let me let me let me ask you a question about I don't feel about being called Bob you know uh I feel like I'm Out at sea and I'm just trying to stay afloat how do you feel about being called John John\n[laughter] of the crime it did not commit yeah you probably should talk closer to the Mike\nOr this thing right yeah um that thing I feel like it's a wonderful unique identifier that I'd be proud to be held by industry right um I mean it's definitely going to be great we were going to have tenure All right so um let's go to at least one of the meat of the show which is that\nI Need to get a tinder profile and I had been nagging my friends for the past weekend I mean for the past week really to uh have at least political pictures political\nPotable yeah that's I think that's like just as French for that I translated in England just drink something\nYeah well there there there's a new question and French that's actually it's it's possible it's fine so many of the kids they place the place of white people All right so let's begin a lesbian with a picture of shall we if we have to so we have to find six pictures\nFor this profile and they're like three photo shoots enter begin with ... so here's the computer for you so go ahead and tell me what the photos are inspiring you\nAnd um yeah you do plays the photos in any particular are now I yeah from the the order of a of a of the photo shoots yeah it was sort of fits in question yes okay and [noise]\nShe by the child and we tried to make this like we took a couple of thoughtful photos of him looking off the camera and a couple of him smiling at the camera and I've been doing some research we found out that smiling at the camera is actually more successful so where do you think about this picture would lay you\nHolding onto the rails by the river and just finally got the camera like an approachable\nDude like a newly single forty two year old dad who was trouble relating to his ten eleven year old daughter's\n[laughter] that's exactly the falling out and I came here for so no go ahead I mean we're we're trying to play some music so is it I Hope it's going to be some sudden music so he can like a twelve on like like my life story essentially\nI mean like my son John Bob John ... yeah it looks like both of you I guess um yeah I have I have I have trouble with him he does the money has those whatever\nSo as the MIT scientist I Am actually put these photos through the experiments of ladies think and on Instagram they voted between this picture of him smiling at the camera and\nI think that's one of them kind of looking off like he's talking to someone like he was ... he was facing off to the river and the he was interrupting he's like oh hey [noise]\nAnd that one one by Seventy percent the smiling one episode was sample sizes about for the women and one male\nAnd then the next while\nThe next photo is\nAgain by the Charles but a different state we minded to uh prepare a couple of outfits that same so this is our number two layers wearing a plane base T shirt with a tropical looking jacket and again he's facing off the camera and this is what we thought to be them\nThe jacket or the like on brain [laughter] ... [laughter] and you have any unnecessary three musketeers facial hair\n[laughter]\nAnd the long season looks over to the side on an overcast day I have to mention that I was not the artistic director on that thing\nAnd it was like [laughter]\nThis is like the the photo I the other one was like being approachable and this one's like lay you\nBeing deep and for some reason somebody was taking a picture it at that moment ... so what do you swipe right now so I ...\nI mean he probably would swipe ... what direction right [laughter]\nOh this is an expert issue so and the basement of the students denser we found this nice paint life and I think it was a barber shop right now do you remember it was the barber shop it's called tacky cuts or whatever that Lincoln yeah\nOh yeah it does say hair cut in the background\nWe placed in a position that half of the space is led by this think his life and I went in to be alone\nIn a coma and laughing again a candidate photo how slowly\nThe guy like whenever the law doesn't look like a oh six ... and humid I Try to me the most ... years of magazine good natural\nSo natural the neon lights\nWhat would you prefer that they were like people who like do\nLike that one was actually a genuine yeah yeah\nYeah I mean I Know you're in front of it but still a lot of people actually takes me about this photo telling me what your friends really cute\nAnd to he said definitely use that photo and tend to provide so now you you are very well aware of that I Do not know which ... we were talking about oh it's still on\nThe base of the oh ... okay so the one where the take me on line and where I'm supposed to be naturally smiling while looking on my phone if one of the ... in front of a closed barber shop at\nSomething like ten pm based on\nReally\nThey just looking at the floor laughing that spicy pay fan for\nAnd then this one was Laos IBM and using the cleaning the bathrooms are willing to do I think an artistic finished shoes\nI don't know I found that the light in the bathroom to be nice if the if this ashamed to say on there is a ... it's not it's not just a shame too much is it is for\nKnow I mean as long as part of that this was me I was at the end you the male bathroom and and then and then at so and then the janitor came into in the restroom and the base when he was like hey what are you doing here and there was a guy or whatever we're just going to go in another bathroom in the third floor\nAnd then you get what happened two minutes after the janitor came in the third or fourth for no reason [noise]\nSo yeah I mean that was highly traumatic experience for you I guess\nWondering which romantic ... yeah\nYeah it's like\nIn the bathroom in a bar that if you're drunk [noise]\nThen this one I'm really proud of when I was at the MIT Chapel and when he was just like scaling and his parents\n... head well OK sorry I Would you miss the thirty seconds before\n... had met again it's unusual in my experience with medical\nMaybe sign language I think\nHe's sending a message with what exactly do you set messing around with your little finger\nAnd that's just a normal holding glasses and [noise]\nYou mean like one of the yeah maybe like a gang say\n[noise]\n\nSo so here we are on to the moral standard poorly led photos [noise]\nYeah I mean you can't not have those on tender you know [noise]\nWhat would you cannot have\nIs photos where your\nBeard and really makes your Facebook Lincoln under trip [laughter]\nThat might suggest [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter]\nI mean he's a world many man so in this photo you need a whole Boston skyline [noise]\nI'll be honest it looks at her shop\n[laughter]\nIt really looks great scared like I think it's just him with a postcard I mean especially after the next picture [noise]\nIt's it's okay\nI wanted to show the scientific side of the ... not that he hasn't yet but you know with a little bit of a Doppler radar in the background that figure that leads to maybe a little engineer comes through the five babies on his team T shirt really do [laughter]\n\nHow many babies had to die for that paper uh apparently one the one that's all right I Am naturally controlled [laughter] [noise]\nMy God [laughter] [noise]\nWe can't not take advantage of the long hair so we we had to go up to an industrial spot and get some nice aged jak exhaust [laughter] you know see what we could work with [noise]\nRight [laughter]\nWow are there any other for this one issue over there are plenty of oh\nOne is like a nice a\nBasic scripts combination\nLooks like you're really shaped one side long and the other but with again with the ...\nAnd and still the babies yeah and and the and the neck beard [laughter] yeah I mean and all the ... just like everything above the shoulders really\nYeah well the one before it had like the nice look of a\nA daytime judge Judy style like\nPre her still kind of interview [noise]\nSomeone you expect to stumble out of a double wide at at four in the afternoon having just spoke about [noise] but this one is something different\nYeah can you describe it down um [noise]\nA nice big Larry image like somebody who has no skill with a camera might take 'em and then a ... lounging on top of this a rooftop you know trying to get a\nI recognize it because the way that is very literally [noise]\nCertainly access to [noise]\nYeah [laughter] I Know you're right it does look like he's waiting for someone to come back with the tell [noise]\n[noise] I ... that's the third ... should know alright\nCreepy uncle at our ... wedding [noise]\nSorry [laughter] did you take that one too [noise] oh no I mean maybe John ... and [noise]\nThen these although they're not you\nYeah go ahead John because then the photos describe them [noise]\nI mean you hear the subject is displaying his his uh\nFixation [noise] um [noise]\nWith what looks to be a hardened latex piece of head gear fetish where\nWas cut out to the eyes um [noise]\nTaken through some kind of barrel or a a closely oppose a leather studded [noise]\nSomewhere near where I assume he hides the buddies I don't know\nAgain what isn't privy to secure there's this photo shoot but I'm just working\nKind of person next one oh no this one looks like you surprised him at work\nThat's a real bad [laughter] when that when you know how like when you see a psychopath you're supposed to get like the the animal shippers of back then you have you haven't seen the pictures of me later on down with me on an abandoned really\nOh that's going to be great\nJust won the the the pinch that a reptilian smile is the thing that I think got me I'm an end up dead I why people gays that doesn't turn you on I mean me yeah\nGrown from the top of a piece of sculpture moments before impact [laughter] a midair underneath some sort of metal wave I'm about to the asphalt his shoes or some had different colors or maybe that's why he was thrown for\nThat one's name a pie and oh man have you seen that funny games\nYeah this is the one where you're dressed up like Michael pet\n[laughter] all white kind of looked like a catty but with like venomous intend [laughter] that's real good [noise] yeah\nLooks like he just got a ...\nA ... and can't quite work it out yet so he's a visiting down and a ... ... this is if I'm a little bit just to get some air down there and maybe he was on the moist grass a little bit too long and there's a little bit past rash going on down there\nAsher Asher Asher Asher\nOkay go ahead because the next sounds pretty good where do you shop for clothing by the\nI'm Sorry where do you shop for clothing by the way so you can have like do you can put in your blacklist\nEssentially\nOr will it mean Halloween is coming up so [laughter]\nUh molesters or us [laughter]\nI don't know why there for you know that I hear is a great place to get [noise]\n... yeah I was like the next to\nThis one is really sweet I think I Would agree that I mean normally writing a cannon right this is yeah this is you a series of wish fulfillment in the [laughter]\nOnly something large in black between your legs\nAnd you are really focused [noise]\nAnnoying you tend to experiment\nYes we are sitting on a candidate [noise]\nAgain it looks like he's sort of haven't been there\nAnd again different colored shoes and jeans on\nI mean if it's a future or by yeah\nI don't know I think they're they're cool right oh no no no not okay\nDoes this look like bowling shoes that were experimented on really just get into the wild\nLike to ... artistic without the filters deadlines flair and the back right and\nYou can see the ... hair like\nHim I mean yeah I Wonder if Jay Jay Abrams is LA hangers on convinced him to take a photo [noise]\nUh this one is the same but run through some shitty sepia filter and and I\nOkay now where I was still on but now there's some very intimate action\nWell he's managed to work his fingers almost to the inside\nWell I mean this is all you're supposed to do a random job right I thought that at least that's the impression I was I'm no expert\nOh black mind you know\nThis is Sara Lee with platinum blown out for his shoulder length hair\nAnd I can't actually see but I Am one hundred percent positive that that she's ...\nThat's ...\nI mean it's not as well in the photos and just in foreign way who is that person bending down in front of her\n\nAs it is they're not somebody a sticking their head in her crotch right now or I told him I don't know what it looks like I'm pretty sure that's what's happening\nYeah\nYeah and you were just you just get a stand\nOff towards late looking at the camera while this occurred yeah we are very nice background\nThat go into your lap [laughter] you're facing forward she's facing backwards I mean [noise]\nIt's symbolic of something\nCool well uh I think that's less picture so a a darn can can can can I I I have like six big trees out of this\nExclude this last one [noise]\nBut not on the\nRadio saying that [laughter] [noise]\nI say [noise]\nAt least one where they can\nAt least for the candidate [laughter] they're really high\nQuality you know it showed them his room job [laughter] how\nIt just looks like this like bucking bronco brides bars and he's trying to stay on none of none of us Jesus God uh [noise]\nI mean maybe your fat life [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nIt was this ... [noise]\nUh ... I mean I don't have new picture so not grand or I guess [noise]\nThere's like a non new picture on the profile and then after that it's essentially just you're taking your ball [noise]\nHey you got to

a great name for a show because there really\nEmphasizes how scheduled this broadcast is it a two AM it's two or three am\nYou guys should be asleep and shouldn't be on the road right now but I understand that people have to work\nGot to got to make that minimum wage I like it it's a good it's good to hustle I feel like I'm here today\nAt the top of the two o'clock hour a basis are loaded it just like um I guess to today in the studio say Hi\n\nOkay they're not going to say Hi we had previously agreed that they would say Hi but they're not doing that and I think\nWe're going to have to

if you'd call 'cause I have things to do I were to say anyway my idea was that I Would do a show and it was just um sixty minutes of the air\nBut with a station id at the beginning top of the hour and um something at the end to indicate that the silence was over or maybe like interspersed in between just cheesy little\nUh yeah I'm right handed but I'm I'm very a left wing when it comes to politics so that kinda makes me a centrist\nAnd there's nothing wrong with being a centrist except everything a but in in the spirit of that [laughter] we're going to listen to some rush he was why why's that [noise]\nAnd you know I have a shot\n\n\n\nAnd\n\nAnd\n\n[noise] oh and I'm not\nA\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nHe's\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nThis is the part of the show where I talk about more than I Am and this

order to uh justify that I'm going to talk about how I knew from ... from a very young age that I'm\nAs an American I Would uh be inclined to pronounce that brush song that I just played as y y and Z However I'm fully aware that ah technically it's pronounced or the Canadian way which um\nI hear is something like a yet yet said\nAnyway that's interesting I Want to move on to some more interesting things names are great it was just a video I saw him through a couple of weeks ago it was a some dude who was like\nI forget what the joke was even but he like change clothes from ... to like a\nLike

world and like what you think about things like how you interpret the current climate and like your opinions\nSo uh I was on my drive today which\nIs kind of ridiculous that I drive anyway I have nowhere to get to I just drive around because I'm I Am at a level of privilege where I can just afford to court to places to to drive for the sake of it and I hate it and it it calms me down them so I

think you can afford the the plane fees so\nIt's just a plain fee such a thing I don't know airlines charge fees but to call a plane ticket a plane fees bit out of touch I think with\nModern lingo

[laughter] your\nMessy homes and uh yeah so I'm finally backed thinks I'm used to speak and I am\nVery excited but also [noise] slowly overwhelms because [laughter] I have accumulated oh lots of\nNew material and her village of really exciting new releases lately so be prepared for the onslaught yeah I don't I don't quite know where to begin\nBecause all my favorite artist [laughter] have been doing this thing\nBut um [noise] I thought I Would start off\nIn the spirit of permits just big isn't an arbitrary I thought I Would start off by playing something from ... new album see at nights and I really haven't gotten to listen to a very much\nBut it's it's a lot more sensible\nSome cosmic acoustic streaming and like when you relax and stuff so this is a little different\nBut\nI'm playing some ... called between Jupiter and Mars\nAnd hope you like this one\nAnd thanks so much for you know listening [laughter] you know like I said\nI have been only been here for a few weeks so you know think through\nSticking with [laughter] [laughter] yeah so he is ...\n[noise] [noise]\nMm [noise] no no no\nThese are ... [noise] Mm Mm\n\nHand\nIn hand\nNa na na\nNa na na\nNa na\nAnd and\nAnd\nAnd\nAnd\nAnd\nAnd and\n[noise]\n\n\n\nMm\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nChemistry one on one and I am very happy that you decided to listen to 'em so I just saw\nPulled underwater boy from Verna lint who is from Sweden\nWas I think she's still alive I'm not sure and that sort of problem shiver uh I actually\nListen to a bit to the whole thing and it's really I like it because\nIt's really messy and interesting and\nIt's kind of this mess of since\nSounds and there's just a lot going on but there's some really good to me I don't know\nThere's this single on their attention stock home\nWhich has a lot of spoken word stuff which I Love 'em but I actually found this song underwater boy thanks to the artist vinyl Williams\nWhich is the band\nName of Lionel Williams the person\nWho makes really really amazing flavors um his taste is\nI don't know it's [laughter] there's no way to describe it it's amazing I don't know how he finds three quarters of this stuff but all pretty much blows my mind so I've been listening to a lot of his ... recently and\n\nCome through in ... and music so that's it's really cool because it provides a lot of background for their recent album but I've been making my way through this play list so\nYeah the coming weeks I'll probably have like at least one song every week but I can like credit to having found because of him [noise] ah so this is one of them\nAre as well as the first no the second time I played ... from the guests who\nWhich again the first time I heard that I was like oh I was a good friend it because I was like I've never heard this before like no one told me and then you also heard the guests which is a little instrumental from\nOh which is also from the eighties [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah I guess this is I guess the play\nLike eighties since music on the show no that's the new premise [laughter] my show [laughter] but I'm from salt let's face and my sister and I actually have the song on a like detective songs playlist\n'cause it makes you feel like you're lurking Under Cover the summer's halting through a building at like with the FBI or something I don't know but ...\nThe first thing I played with a new song from good trip from their new album called between Jupiter and Mars and okay so next\nI have been [laughter] waiting to play this it's a new song from failure which is obviously extremely exciting because I talk about family or every two seconds but\nAnd then in a couple of months before the the fourth and final ... will come out and then that'll be the whole album so they're kind of releasing it in chunks their album which I guess is what we do in the twenty first century [noise]\nYeah like for instant gratification of the releases\nBut this one this is he is called in the future\nSo\nThe titles of the really says so far\nI've been I'm\nIn the future the next one was your body will be the one they just released is called the for this thing and I'm pretty sure that the last one will called like from your mind or something like in the future of your body will be the furthest thing from your mind which is really cool\nAnd tricky and it makes sense with\nKind of the stuff they've been talking about in interviews recently so I Will finally saw talking and all that you enjoy this new song from failure it is called heavy and the lines\nAnd it is\nDefinitely on par with if not better than much of their early material from the nineties\n[noise] so\nYeah I'm hope you enjoy the sun and thank you a lot for listening\n\nThere are\n[laughter]\n\nThe\nNew\nNa\n\nNa\nNa\n\nShe she she\nJust sheer trash\n\nVery much into\nWhen\n\nAble to maintain a couple of people\nYou know what [noise] the\nIn\n\n...\n\n\nThank you for listening to chemistry went to one today\nSo I just put a song from astronaut et cetera off they're relatively new album and the song is called fly over when you\nYet which you probably could have guessed because your pizza like twenty times more um and then before that was acknowledgment from the Mets into\nFrom the Mets into play you a ...\nThe Supreme and I guess it's kind of weird to just play\nLike one discreet song offered that released because it's kind of like one\nIt's kind of like one whole long thing\nI don't know like I never I never listened to I never listen to just one of the songs I always listen to what the whole way through but I guess it was not the\nDay\nTo play the whole twenty five minute dating he made a few weeks when I don't know maybe maybe around finals when I have no time I'll just\nThrow on the [laughter] the Mets in to play a love Supreme\nBut um yeah I really like 'em they're guitar\nSound and when I applied to\nThis musical work [noise] [laughter] because obviously the original is really good an iconic parts I think they also do a really good job making\nIts own their own so and the ... before that as a new song from ... new album my son at temple I think the sign and temples and so it was called the orange peel\nAnd if they actually do not there from Japan but they do not seeing in any language which I think

regularly come to these houses tell them to to knock it off tell them to quiet down they didn't have to ever pay for anything they did\nSo you get that sense if you're a kid and you can break the rules\nAnd then you go to college that tells you that you're special you're among the you're going to be part of the ruling class that you're there because you are the very best and you know use the very best and you know there's no accountability for your\nActions that all this is what you hear your whole life this is what's impressed upon you your whole life then you get into the White House and he was a lot of people who are saying it doesn't matter if we break\nThe law it doesn't matter if we pay attention to international law\nIt doesn't matter if we arrest people who are Muslims in Afghanistan and we're going to put them in in a prison in Cuba Guantanamo were going to send them to black sites all over the place we're going to torture them we're going to ignore international commitments\nWe're going to ignore everything we can do it because we're the bully on the block\nAnd I think these kids were bullies on the block when they were used\nAnd I think they got used to lying and I think they got used to having their way\nAnd what's so clear about brick Kevin as he dissemble or outright lied to Congress about his participation in at least one discussion\nOf the torture program the detention program without you know the end of ... corpus that was going on in the Bush administration he assembled or outright lied about other things you know whether he got\nDocuments that belong to the Democrats\nHe was not truthful in all his testimony during those hearings so he has a record you know between\nSampling and evasion and he has a record of being someone who thinks the rules don't apply to him and don't apply to his class and his group\nThe fact that he signed onto a case that was whether a titan and touchy which are um private contractors that supplied interrogators and translators to the U.S government\nTo work in a black sites in and out of a great prison and he signed on to the decision they're saying that the people who were victimized\nWere tortured by these contractors in Iraq couldn't sue for civil a dirty couldn't suit tightening catchy and this decision he signed onto was so obscure and so remote and basically just saying that we have to protect tightening catchy we have to protect these corporations\nAnd you completely forget what the subject is once you read as you're reading these this tortured pros sorry for the word but until you get to Merrick Garland of all people his dissent in the same case\nAnd they are in the center at the very front of his dissent is the human person you know beat and blinded humiliated strung up shocked raped forced to watch his father died extinguished that's what you get from Merrick Garland\nFrom Brett Kavanaugh you get the sense that how do we set the rules to get the rich guys off but he did get back\nTo your question about high school in that one of the things that was so striking about his performance at the Senate was his absolute sense that he'd been denied something he deserves by right\nThere's incredible entitlement and you know we hear this word a lot but that's what really came through for me watching the hearings was how enraged people is mostly for himself\nAnd how his intent fundamentally were about having gone to the rights of him having worked his tail off work work work how he does this moment and what not to be on the prank card\nAnd certainly not want him probably why the fact that got in high school\nThat was independent journalists joann ... co editor of the book killing Trayvon's anthology of American Violence\nFind a link to

he got all the will be just to get together whoever would sign up to it that it\nTo pledge to make additional pledges to either ... or a you know in terms of hosting more refugees\nAnd the other part of that was that the member states to get together and come up with a more comprehensive plan to handle migrants and refugees so the Trump Administration is largely focused on dismantling anything that President Obama put together that seems to be a primary for okay\nAnd so of course they weren't going to sign onto the now\nThis is extremely disappointing to the rest of the world to other

station a thank you for that good [laughter] show as always it's and I've missed you thing\nThat would spread as you mentioned I have Marvin are there are margins my roommate services at\nThe last the last one I think I've got an or other teammates if I had a number on the other two roommates on the show if you don't know what the show is ISIS productions and Valentino your house here on WNPR and\nIt's who it is what it is um and to figure out you know how people talk about and how they think about it uh and it's it's been it's been a good time uh\nI also wanted to mention that are on October twenty fifth the uh Cambridge Historical Society will be having a\nA symposium that's free of the public um and it will be covering sanctuary cities because this year's theme for that can be just ... is\nWhere it's Cambridge from which is a pretty relevant question I'm for this show so uh if you're interested in that you can check it out um he's been playing since ... says so if you forget the information if you listen to WNPR you'll probably hear it again so definitely stay tuned\nA Mormon you had a couple of songs ah that you wanted to play um do you want to start with the ... yeah well so for that one uh\nI don't have to pull it up but a giant tell us a little bit about why you chose a song\nYeah so snow angels by on I'm On a ... is a song to me it doesn't quite represent what home isn't but rather represents getting home for me it's a song or listen to a lot when I was always on the bus going home to New Jersey from Boston back in college so\nIt was in one of the list I downloaded on Spotify so it would always show up because I had a little bit limited space in my pocket download music so\nOf course there are all the songs but that was always the one that I could always\nDepend on through like I Would like it's nothing to do whatever I was thinking I just listen to it and it kind of represented getting home for me and even now when I'm working like when I'm a ... home on the bus or back to a quarter square do home it shows up a lot to all my ... so it represents going home to me\nOh well we'll give adolescence stay tuned in we'll talk more\n\n\n\n\n\nSo that was snow angels by an amount of Gucci off of the album\nEndless fantasy ... this is America and selection as you want to follow along with our very short play list you can follow along at ... dot com or I'll be updating live in tongues are playing all that stuff or they have anyway are kind of answered this already but ah where do you live\nUh I live here in the Boston area with ... ... square with don't get a\nFair remains it's my time's up so I mean I Know I Know a lot about you but [laughter] because we've lived here for\nTwo years two years in a month um but uh so tell me so tell me where have you lived um in addition to like like where where did the different places that you lived over\nYour life right so ... it's actually pretty short listed you back on the Jersey north Jersey gr view\nOr MIT 'em up or those who don't know when you go down to dinner and then reporters were very short lived mhm and what was\nGuess I'm so you have you lived in Jersey with your family and then uh you came to Cambridge for school for MIT um what choices I guess when into going going there\nAnd my TV on and I was just MIT or in a different way of answering that question I wasn't too worried about leaving home back when I was bringing out what place I wanted to go to college to\nPlan B there is not as much an or as often as my parents would like it to be but\nIt's\nYou know that's what I Do ...\nIs there are there other connections I'm back in ... in in Jersey that ah that you still maintain a U.S out you know aside from family\nI maintain a few mostly it's like a few messages you know be a Facebook or ... or whatever\nBut when I visit New Jersey I don't really see a lot of them a lot of close ones I've had kind of spread out a little bit mhm so when I visit New Jersey it's mostly to see my family ... you know of course my immediate family of the most part on and muggy and when I visit I inevitably will see one of my cousins 'cause a lot of it comes to sit in the area so see them\nOr this year early if I go back home for Christmas which I Will\nIt'll be a little different\nUh especially uh my brother moved away from her home town so a little bit a little while away so there'll be a little hard to see him and oh am I going to spread out so we'll see how that goes\nYeah and\nYeah I'm so is this the it'll be it'll be the first it'll be a very different experience going home and I suppose to like the last time that you yeah uh yeah I guess I kind of maybe also contributes to like missing\nMissing you know ... of the home that was yeah 'cause it it'll be different now yeah well\nUh I Wanna talk 'cause you since you don't really miss home or Jersey as it is right uh so when you feel home sick what do you feel homesick for and if if you even feel homesick\nRight I was about to say I don't normally feel homesick at all usually when I'm\nTraveling around for example I don't really\nThe little temporary area I'm In will be home for that little bit so it's more of a um\nA for example I remember one night and you're on the others had been walking around the entire day\nAnd I was just tired all the little grumpy 'cause I was kinda hungry in like you know I didn't I didn't I had to eat too much that day 'cause I was running around like going to museums and like talking to people and it was a lot of fun but\nAt the moment I thought I really want to be home and I didn't think about our apartment in Puerto square I had been thinking more about the you know a ... a good thing for that time\nAnd uh for like a little while that little one room in that apartment was home to me ...\nYeah I think that's interesting um they can adapt to wherever you're at is\nActually have a like a like I mentioned earlier today a although you've already news puts us more for the radio but I went to burning man and for all for that entire week home tree was that tent out in the middle of the desert and every night thinking I Want to go home and you know I like all the way back to camp and I'd\nLike you know they've open the door to my time closing and pass out I think I'm home\nIt was a little bit of a weird experience definitely like on the plane ride come back I'm from Reno to Boston I was thinking oh I Can't wait to be home and you know that shifted to my bed in ... square where I could go to sleep not covered in sand and dust\nBut ah it's it's something I have\nThought about before I'm not quite sure why I have this mentality of my home is can be very easily shifted for some period of time it's kind of happens yeah\nDo you think do you know maybe where the limits to that are like do you think there is like you know in our social spaces\nOh I definitely think oh I wouldn't be home in you know Somerville maybe like permanent residents right exactly so when I'm In a plane like definitely like there's one place I Want to be and that's a home where it's obviously where I live yeah although I feel like that's kind of because for a lot of people [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] I mean some people feel like a plane and tell them [laughter] um but yeah I mean I guess it's just I I I'd be interested to hear if you ever find what were the one that that is I mean probably it'd be a pretty negative experiences right yeah I make that home if you made like you know the desert [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah I'm so maybe I don't want to hear [laughter] stay\nOr at least be interesting to figure out like where that one it is\nYeah I I've always been wondering I've actually wondered about that too because again I've actually thought about how it it just doesn't feel a little weird to me even though it's happening to me and I can like internalize it feels weird to me that home can just change so easily for me\nAnd I've been wondering if it would require you know just a larger long amount of time for it for me to start feeling homesick for where I live ... or if it just be I'd be so out of my element or something my trip I mean I guess\nHow how was your experience with college um because that was the first time leaving what was home a and you made a new one but\nIt was also yeah right yeah that actually again that I had no problems at ... I was excited to be going somewhere near that I've never been before I actually distinctly remember the\nDay before I left for an IT I was running down bad because I had a bit of a headache\nAnd my my mother was always babysat my younger cousins and I was lying down I had a bit of a headache I think my mother told me because not to bother me 'cause I had a bit of a hat\nAnd it was like oh I'm going to miss this person I'm going to miss a small child in my life\nAnd of course you know I did miss her but home when I got to came to Cambridge and you know ... that was home for me they made it became so I had no qualms about changing that\nEr and\nPart of me as a little concerned that the U.S [laughter] would you say\nThe bad a blog Dave out where I live I don't know I can certainly the rest of my family were little you know all over the place about it my mother was really\nNot devastated but she was very sad about it you did you leave the home and you know in fact ... exactly [laughter] but\nYeah it to me is just another part of life and ... even though it was a part of life that I had an experience yet I was I was ready for it and I just when\nYou feel is adaptability um has prevented itself and other aspects um you know there's like you know the adaptability of being able to call wherever you are home and like what do you what do you what what do you think is a grand a consequence of that\nNot that the consequences might you know sound negative I don't mean necessarily in that way and I was a there is something that is weird\nPart of something I've recognized over the years is you know I Lived in Jersey my whole life so\nUh for a long time I just thought to myself oh yeah I'm I'm a Jersey Boy when everyone else but then I kind of realized no I'm not\nWhen I was in college I meet other people from New Jersey you know you did you do as well you know we have mutual friends and we talk about things and we talk about like you know the base level of things are important like you know yeah bagels are better there pizza's better better there but then when it came down to it\nYeah this is very important um I you know going down to a south ready to go to the beaches or what do you live on the turnpike 'cause a lot of people in and basically every under the nose at answer a spoiler I don't [laughter]\nAnd so is this thing where I don't think because I wrote that attached to a place of homework and so easily adopted or just moved to a change what aren't whenever I Want I don't become\nThat attached to where I live so for so for a long time I thought I was just from someone from Jersey because that's the only because I had ever lived but when I got here and\nThat turnpike exit exam plugs actually exactly what made me start thinking about this I'm going to like the medical one day a because I had very and burned myself cooking and I was like oh maybe maybe I should get the ... little it's a little bad\nAnd the person who saw me with all from Jersey and I forget how it got brought up but she asked me what turnpike ... are you off and I thought\nA and that kind of moment made me realize that my adaptability of where home is means I'm not really a part of it or you know I'm not part of that home with the greeter area\nThat's interesting like I guess the way it differently and putting it like do you feel like you belong um let's see different things\nI feel like to me that's kind of two different things like I certainly feel like a at the time like I Belong there rain\nLike I said I just don't think I had any attachment to it so [noise] Mm\nWhere I kind of took for granted all those songs and my mother and father played it was surrounded me by means in my entire life but I never thought of thinking you know who is this man what is the phone call and then I just lost it\nAnd I you know they're maybe four or five years later it popped up again instead of reminded me of home because like it ... you know\nIt's something I've heard before I felt a little uh you know again not sad or in Hong Kong but\nIt's kind of a weird wake up call 'cause I I don't know if you feel the same but I don't feel it's in that sense moving away from home in Jersey from that place\nI've been losing Spanish language a bit I've been\nI feel like I'm struggling a little bit more whenever I talk to my parents on the phone 'cause I don't you spend as much so in a way these just uh the sun and the other songs of the album or a ... kind of represent this weird thing where I've lost that home last a little bit of my language last little bit of my culture\nAnd this is kind of a general reminder of that and I\nI guess ... you're not sad it's not that you necessarily feel sad about it they just had it you just aware and check is\nYeah I mean you know it makes sense I don't speak Spanish home anymore I speak English so it's something that will happen but again it's a social than at rising that maybe I should be trying a little harder to preserve it ... actually how\nI actually had this conversation again the same event wildfire last time I went back in may I met\nWho's funding enough a lot it was kind of my doppelganger uh so uh for the people who don't know me which is I guess a lot of people [laughter] I had a really long hair down to like maybe a quarter of my back down and I cut it all off back in may and I went to wildfire and a lot of he wouldn't recognize me at first\nSame wildfire someone shows up who looks a lot like me with my old have really long hair they kept this taking him for me so I'm going down and walking down a the little mess all they have one day and only hear someone shout mouse\nYou can and we sat down and talked a he's also Hispanic and this is we had a long conversation about what it means Hispanic and what it means to have or how it feels to be losing a part of that now they are not surrounded by everyone but your family\nBecause he also felt a little bit uh he he was losing the language you've been getting words a ...\nI don't [laughter] I don't remember what I was going with this but\nI guess I had to kind of brought up the point of 'em that this is something that you that there are things that reminds you of this but you're not necessarily sad as a result the year just you are aware of this thing that just is the case yeah\nAnd it seems to me like you know what people are going through them and I think the cohesion that he and his name is ... and you know I came together was which maybe try and preserve that\nIn a way maybe this is similar to help me preserve part of what it felt like to have a home in Jersey I don't know but it's certainly something I Want to maybe try a little harder\nDamp and that's I think that's fair um yeah I Want to go back to something that we were kind of beginning to explore before we played the song which is\nThe difference between being from somewhere and belonging somewhere and being part of somewhere ... ah and I think one of the things that has kind of come to light and our discussion is that your adaptability\nTo what end where home is means that where from where you are from\nKind of also will change yeah this is very very fluid definition for me yeah um but then belonging summers very dependent I think on like your actual experience right where you are\nI guess is the thing where I didn't I never thought about the question until ... ... so it was never appointed you never felt like didn't wrath exactly because you would I feel like you would know if you didn't write\nExactly I'm so his mother is never a question that I posed for myself or I Would represent about\nMhm but\nDefinitely when I got to Cambridge I felt like I Belong to a little bit of maybe it's because I was always a critical and my two most when we were there and so I felt like a prolonged but\nWhat I think about I never really stop him thought about ... ...\nSir I'm fat I feel like another thing is also a thing that might be different as\nAt least like you know New Jersey versus your experience ... um is being part of something and being part of the place like you feel like you weren't part of New Jersey and that didn't come to light to you until you were talking to other people who are now\nFrom New Jersey because when you're in you know I feel like it's this thing where like when you're in a context whatever it is you don't have to think about\nWhether you're from that place or not right in most cases that's obviously in there they are not true um or that don't make that experience true but uh you know you maybe don't have to think about where you're from when everyone is\nLike a sense of Lee from that place right that when you leave and you're in college especially where everyone's from everywhere like you start talking about the things that you have in common and that kind of drew delight to that like maybe you're you're from there and they're from there but you don't uh you don't\nBelong or you're not part of their right in the same way that maybe someone else\nIt's this weird thing where I think part of just for me is belonging summers depending on the people around me and like when I Do there\nSo I don't think I can like quick answer do I feel like I Belong here in Somerville Cambridge ill Boston quite yet I don't think I've lived here long enough to be able to like fully act really answer that I don't really feel that\nIn other cases though like um [noise] I've mentioned it a few times already will put wildfire uh started going in there about three years ago in a pound\nAnd a lot of people when you first got there they'll say you know welcome home and it's nothing that I never really thought about\nAre never really understood but this past spring when I went a gun and been you know it's only run to the spring and summer so our special so it's been awhile since I had been and the first time someone said welcome home I thought yeah I Am I Belong here\nAnd it's a little bit of a weird one to think about it at home because you know you ended up getting you're in the middle of the woods or you're in a tent but there's a lot of people around the world there for the same thing yeah and uh\nHe was pretty pretty profound part wanting to cut out little emotion to click\nYeah that's cool it's like I'd have that experience I had to get that hadn't said check kind of um concrete\nKnowable dealing with that yeah\nI Do you feel like you might know more about why they belong in Cambridge when you move somewhere else and can put it in relief I think probably that's what it might take ... I can move since my definition of homo so malleable\nI kind of took for granted all those Spanish songs that played throughout my childhood and I didn't really think about it until I was had been ... been away from me for so long mhm so I think some of the way it might take living somewhere else to look at Cambridge look at some of the laws I Belong there not here mhm\nThat's interesting I guess is it possible it give you actively try to you is it possible to figure out what things you may take you may realize later that you're taking for granted now\nI don't really feel like it's possible to like kind of realize what you're taking for granted I think if you think you know if you think enough on it you'll find those things um\nEspecially if it's I think for me it's just that I hadn't done that when I moved away from Jersey ... and that's the only big move by for pretend before so I think that was my first time\nLosing the things I took for granted yeah and so I hadn't thought about it I think at this point if I make another move in my life at some point I'm actually started thinking about what will be losing and when I take for granted and if I Would move away from Boston yeah I mean I think the question of like what are you taking for granted\nThat's a good [laughter] they one of them is pretty decent public transportation [laughter] like I think of the west coast I'm you know like I said I visited", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Cambridge", "day": "03"}
