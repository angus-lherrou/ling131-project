before we get into the stories uh\nDid you do any\nAlarming how loud it was I mean it's thunder you expect ... founder it's one of the loans things you're done here outside of a volcanic corruption and uh\nBut that the founders was particularly loud last week or this past week\nOr at least it seemed that way to me just because I don't I don't know maybe because I'm I now live\nIn a residence immediately on the Charles\nSo there's less obstruction of other buildings perhaps a damn thing the sound or maybe maybe I've just I was just closer to the thunderstorm than I've ever been before was somehow I doubt that but a\nA one way or another that was that was the loudest and longest role of thunder that I had a I'd ever heard previously but um\nYeah today we are moving in we're moving close to Halloween all Hallows eve that uh that wonderful holiday initially intended to uh where uh initially where you would do on the garb of\nA sinister ... a sinister specter or spirit in order to spook said spirits from a\nFrom a sliding your seasonal harvest and now it's a throw as well as ... as well as a sinister and spooky we throw a scantily clad and satire satirical into the mix\nWith a variety of costumes not necessarily in the original spirit of Halloween but\nTraditions adapt it gets and uh\nIt just be interesting to see a\nFrom like an original all Hallows eve\nSee what would we are turned their holiday into\nBut ah enough enough with the civil ... let's move on to the actual stories for tonight our first and a longest story\nIs rip van Winkle by Washington Irving now if you were tuning in Fort and I had to go you know that I uh I attempted to read part of this on the air and horribly underestimated how long it would take for me to read it\nBut I've uh I've attempted to counter that by recording this ahead of time this this part right now I'm doing live but\nThe actual recording of the the uh speaking of the stories has been done ... so we will uh this is going to be a test just to see that uh I made this\nEffectively uh that I recorded this effectively and also that er visits that you'd like the quality of the sound like I might I may switch back to reading live on the air but that all depends on whether or not I think that the er\nThe errors are worth my occasional like my occasional bumbling on the air is worth the difference in sound quality so we'll a\nLittle ... test that out and here is rip van Winkle\nTale was found among the papers of the late ... Knickerbocker an older gentleman to New York it was very curious in the history of the province and the managers of the descendants from his primitive settlers historical research is however did not lie so much among books as among men\nFor the former Harlem actively scanty on his favorite topics whereas he found the old burgers and still more of their wives rich in that\nThe ugly shut up and it's low rift farmhouse under a spreading sycamore she looked upon it as a little class volume of black letter and studied it with the zeal of a bookworm\nThe result of all these research is was the history of the province during the reign of the Dutch governors which he published some years since there have been various opinions as to the literary character of his work and to tell the truth is just not a witch better than it should be\nIts chief merit is it scrupulous accuracy which indeed was little questioned on its first appearance but has since been completely established and it is now admitted into all historical collections as a book of unquestionable authority\nThe old gentleman died shortly after the publication of his work and now that he is dead and gone it cannot do much harm to his memory to say that his time might have been much better employed in a way to your labors she however was apt to rise his hobby his own way\nAnd do it did now and then kick up the dust of little in the eyes of his neighbors and dreams of spirit if some friends for whom he felt the truce difference and affection\nYet his ... and Follies remembered more in sorrow than in anger and it begins to be suspected that he never intended to injure or offend\nBut however his memory may be appreciated by critics is still held dear by many folk who's good opinion is well worth having\nParticularly by certain biscuit bakers who've gone so far as to imprint his likeness on their new your kicks and if that's given him a chance for immortality almost equal to the being stamped on her Waterloo metal or queen ...\nWhoever has made a voyage up the Hudson must remember the Catskill Mountains they were dismembered branch of the great Appalachian family and her see in a way to the west of the river swelling up to a noble height and loading it over the surrounding countries\nMagical Hughes and shapes of these mountains and they are regarded by all the good wives foreign near as perfect parameters when the weather is fair and settled they're closed and blue and purple and print they're bold outlines on the clear evening sky\nBut sometimes when the rest of the landscape is club list they will gather a hoot of grave papers about their summit which in the last rays of the Setting Sun will glow in light up like a crowd of glory\nAt the foot of the spare mountains the Voyager may have described the light smoke curling up from a village who's shingle roofs glean among the trees just one of the blue tents of the upland melts away into the fresh green up the mirror landscape\nIt is a little village of great antiquity having been founded by some of the Dutch colonists in the early times the province just about the beginning of the government of the good Peter Stuyvesant making rest in peace\nAnd there were some of the houses of the original settlers standing within a few years built of small yellow bricks brought from Holland having lettuce windows windows and gave all fronts surrounded with weather Cox\nIn that same village and in one of these very houses which to tell the precise truth was sadly time worn and weather beaten there lived many years since while the country was you had a province of Great Britain a simple good natured fellow of the name of rip van Winkle\nHe was a descendant of the van Winkle zoo figured so violently into shiver stays with Peter Stuyvesant and accompanied him to the siege of Fort Christina\nShe inherited however but little of the Marshall character of his ancestors I have observed that he was a simple good natured man he was more over a kind neighbor ended obedient hadn't packed husband\nIndeed to the letter circumstance might be going that meeting as the spirit which gained him since\nAnd the truth at home their tempers outlets are rendered pliant and malleable and the fiery furnace of domestic tribulation and a curtain lecture is worth all the sermons in the world for teaching the virtues of patience and long suffering\nA terminal ... wife may therefore in some respect be considered a tolerable blessing and if so rip van Winkle was thrice blessed\nRip now felt a vague apprehension stealing over him she looked anxiously in the same direction and perceived to strange features slowly toiling up the rocks and bending under the weight of something he carried on his back\nHe was surprised to see any human being and just lonely and an frequented place but supposing it to be some one of the neighborhood in need of his assistance he hastened down to yield it\nOn nearer approach he was still more surprised at the singularity of the strangers appearance he was a short square built all fellow with the bushy hair and a grizzled beard\nHis dress was of the antique Dutch fashion o'clock jerking strapped around the waist several pair of breaches the outer one of apple volume decorated with rows of buttons down the sides and bunches at the knees she bore on his shoulder stopped keg that seemed full of liquor\nAnd made signs for rip to approach an assistant with the load\nThe rather shy and distrustful of this new acquaintance ripped complied with his usual electricity and mutually relieving one another they claimed bring up a narrow belly apparently the dry bit of a mountain tolerant\nEssay ascended rip every now and then heard long rolling peels like distant thunder that seem to issue out of a deep ravines or rather cleft\nBetween last Iraq's toward which they're rugged path conducted\nShe paused for an instant but supposing it to be the monitoring of one of those transient thunder showers which often take place in mountain heights keep her seat it\nPassing through the ... they came to a hollow like a small amphitheater surrounded by perpendicular precipice as over the brains of wage impending trees shot the branches so that you only caught glimpses of the as your sky in the evening cloud during the whole time ripping his companion had Labor Day\nTo end this mystery explore

are show focusing on issues that are placed specific I'm related to climate change I teach and um I was asked us um oceans quality um any quality\nBefore having a few more technical difficulties but\nJust a few more months right when you maybe we should just start\nYou focused on San Juan and whether you go and talking about a recovery and disaster and this week I'm we're switching 'em to\nDecidedly different context um and that is New York city\nWhich were really excited to cover for a variety of reasons both of us have connections I'm to the place as it seems that a lot of people do um five virtue of its size and scale and everything like that so they're going to be focusing specifically on um\nEconomic development income inequality as it relates to climate change infrastructure planning and how these things really um [noise] I think New York sort of break when central and a lot of ways for this kind of subject given um the amount of capital this concentrated they're given it's entirely huge structural scale\nAnd I'm the sort of like different populations that have been living there\nUm and the legacy of thought so I think that [noise]\nTo consider a place like this um is really important and talking about any of these issues\nSo I'm\nJust to clarify as well um is that\nThis week will just be playing music and chatting about our own experiences and it'll be more informal um and in two weeks so not next Thursday Thursday after 'em and we're going to be on air doing them more formal kind of ... version of this show where we include interviews and collapse and tell the story I'm\nFrom people that um will be interviewing for that\nGreat I think we can also just go back to playing our first song I think we got that and rolled up so [laughter] we'll start with that and they'll be back soon\n[noise]\nDrop and right next to the number of\nNot sure us and just made if I could make you anywhere they love me\nFifty they streets just me and they did you like a few minutes we're going to be ...\nLimited drivers don't smoke but we can't get that to me\nTo begin the billboard and I've\nStarting to get me a\nOf them are going to stand down

don't mean back in ... new game\nAnd out of everybody in the [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nMy\nSon\nToo\n[laughter]\nIn any of the county and calm\n\n[laughter]\nAnd\nI mean who made that [laughter]\nThere's that and there's also this longer legacy of them are going on justice but is not so much climate oriented more oriented towards indoor and outdoor air quality which affects people's bodies and livelihoods and it really immediately so I think the legacy of data activism also sort of carry forward\nBut that that's something that does feel like a very very big collective worry a collective problem that requires like some more institutional thinking because it requires a ton of money requires planning in a very sort of blankets and so I think\nYes put off now [laughter] uh I I I\nMean like obviously like this is just one story out of many that that I think needs to be considered in the context of of climate justice and climate planning I mean\nEvery every go by the New York and many other and many other places in in the United states and elsewhere like comedians color and on real populations have always been relegated to areas of um of the city or of a region which are\nHeavily industrial which are the things that like make the city or it can happen and are like really dirty are really like polluting and not just for the air but also just\nUm you know water sources or uh the general like environment you know like how the how um you know like toxic chemicals might be um\nPlaced in like places that they used that shouldn't be accurate ... accessible to like everyday people\nUm or\nKnow they just all these different things that I think us especially in New York like that's a place that we see as like a financial capital as an economic like powerhouse in terms of just money and flows of money but\nYou know the history of New York is like oh hey like there was a lot of industry and production here and there still is um and there's still a lot of important like industrial areas in the city both within Manhattan and in the other boroughs\n[noise] uh something that we think about when we think about New York uh and in in those places in these like\nPlaces that people don't\nLike kind of how like in their mind is what makes New York New York or um [noise] what might be like more mainstream or whatever like I think is in these places and a lot of cities but maybe especially New York but it seems particularly ignored 'em or their issues like\nThe AR misunderstood mhm\n[noise] yeah I mean I think that's definitely true and I think that\nWhen it comes to New York it has to sort of like a very\nInteresting because it has this sort of like very if you want to vilify certain characters in New York um as I Want to do um they they offer [noise] I mean that like a future but I mean I think there's this image of like decrease class and like all those annoying people that like work and\nSort of they don't produce industrial manufacturing work products that are like very money people that move money around whatever like finance years not\nThat the whole of the commentary for another day but like I think that that the image that you're talking about this image of like money and wealth but when it comes out of thin air that like is very pristine and not associated with industry um so I think that's when an image but I also think that um one thing that when it comes to mind in New York is\nThis sort of like gargantuan scale of infrastructure and how all of that even functions like we're a bus depots we're waste transfer stations like where the inputs in opposite the city going um and I think that is something that like is burned\nInto my brain a little bit like whenever you take the bus in New York like that's what you see it and I know that\nA lot yeah one of those things are cited in places\nYou will like insane sort of display of it that is the image but the image is also one that very much like you can see parts of like how the city has to function by the sort of like metabolic scale by which it functions so\nYeah I think when it as like stories of infrastructure when it comes to New York like nothing I think about is a Hurricane Sandy I'm do any she'll be like talk a little bit about Hurricane Sandy\nAh yeah um if you want to insult people haven't heard about it um\nI mean twenty twelve\nHuge superstorm um Hurricane Sandy hit New York and a lot of the north east um New York was not ready at all ... there were\nSandbags placed on the front of many buildings in the financial district I just like these are just like the images I remember I'm completely not ready for the extent of flooding that would happen or an area um\nLots and lots of uh\nBuildings they had dug like really deep underground um what high rises that had done that a lot of office buildings I I'm not\nCompletely flooded anything below like obviously ground level flooded I'm and I'm just like over all life is like huge mega city that has\nLike five different boroughs with all these different planning departments literally like what three hundred thousand people who work for the city um\nNone of that really mattered at the end ah tons of damage um and but the thing the story the story the number is that um there's a there's this tunnel\nLike a a like a sewer\nReally like it like release a lot of water and like a storm storm water runoff I'm back into the ocean and that\nPipeline was a direct connection between the storm that came in and the center of the city mhm um and it was just like it just you know kind of dawned on me like when I was listening to the story and like\nThis was during class time and I was like wow like there are some places that you know like you try to design and you design again and you plan um\nFor for these types of things and you never really know or understand how it's going to work until it happens um or you can do your best or like maybe in a city like New York where there's so many overlapping\nLike plans and infrastructure um and like things you inherit from the past that you can't really figure out what what it is that you do and just like that that scale kind that fascinates me about New York\nI think the scale is fascinating I mean I think you are very much speaking as like a plant are but for for me and like that like the scale I think is fascinating from that perspective to me I think like the way in addition to that what is really interesting is just like\nHow you think about wealth\nIn your experience of infrastructure early because New York is like a kind of thing where it's like you can I mean just really back to some of the work that you're going to be doing here I'm like in New York you can get\nSort of like any sort of material guy if you're if you have money you can like you have access to everything and that is what makes it so magical insane and you don't see the pathways by which those things get to you I'm doing the ... by which like your everyday functioning\nI'm In a little apartment like how all that sort of ...\nMeaning fracturing some publicly owned building that relates to dealing with the function that the physical functions the city so like I think like when you're wealthier so isolated from those processes um and you don't know people that have to deal with that and I think it's really interesting because like\nYou have a city where anything is possible writings except accessible to you but there's like such there's so much bears are so many processes that function in order to get to you um\nWhich I mean I guess if you want to talk about your thesis um really the food that's like the sort of like food ... ability\nAnd yeah I mean I think okay let's play let's play a couple of songs and then what did you come back ah that's what we can do it because I because I have a couple of story there\nUm but coming up next um American Pie by Stalin Kanye a New York I Love you but you're bringing\nMe down you can buy\nLCD sound system All right we'll be back [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nOr like climate change Israel yeah or like\nIt's cool like the the world is it that's all you may find 'em there's something cause making wild about that scale which is scary and interesting but\nI don't know it's not really how people experience the world to talk about it that way\nYeah so we had ... stories\nThe break we cover a little bit about a climate justice and equity and what's it mean to\nUm [noise] look at infrastructure and I'm just like\nBeing someone in New York who has to face this idea of increased storms or increase heat or um development housing ... like all these things are kind of related yeah\nUm and ah\nI think we want to discuss with like why why why ... New York related to me as opposed to like ... with us read the words there this summer and for me a New York is where my dad is from and where my dad's side of the family is from\nA but also a place that really fascinates me in terms of like like intellectual your academically\nAnd there's a lot of case studies I'm drawing from either actress pieces this year um and I guess I Want to talk a little bit but my my first thesis topic um this was the original topic I proposed that used a lot of case studies from New York\nAnd it's around this idea of a social capital and social infrastructure\nUh which essentially in tons of disaster and disaster mitigation planning or whatnot um\nEspecially one of the storm or when there is a some sort of emergency situation ah generally people who plan for these things want Comey nice to have a lot of social capital and what that means a lot of connections between you and your neighbor um\nYou and ah your local services like basically a lot of communication and a lot of like I guess [laughter] supposedly sense of community or care um there's less\nUm is because uh when you have social capital it's been kind of proven over horse a lot of studies is like\nOne it's more likely that you're cleaning rule recover faster the only because you know what's missing you know what's needed and you check in on your ah your peers and your neighbors um [noise] but also because ah\nYeah you you know you have access to these services and you are communicating with one another and so that's just like\nJust like social capital social infrastructure kind of thing and something that ah\nPlanners and disaster a recovery people really want to build up\nAnd so my original topic was looking at this idea of building social capital because this is something that we want 'em and uh but I was looking at this relationship so in some cases a social capital kind of\nDoesn't allow you to truly adapt to the risks that come with climate change so what I argue is that uh when it comes to climate adaptation when it comes to truly moving\nFrom risk we have to give up a couple of things one of them being maybe our\nUh ability to live anywhere that we want and I think you know social capital as important sense of places and um but building this up also means that people don't want to give up this community like having more\n... capital in your community means that you don't want to move away from that place um until you see that in a lot of places such as um\nA New Orleans Louisiana um where a lot of people kind of return to their place or they're to me because they really love their community um but the those areas\nThis uh this idea of sort of capital also have like the inverse effect so and places like Staten Island in New York um a lot of people after Hurricane Sandy utilizing capitalize on this\nThis network of people to organize and really get themselves are really good ... collectively they made a decision to\nMove away um and that they got what they needed from from the state and from the federal government because they had this huge organizing power so I was looking at what is the my original question was like what is um\n[noise] basically how our cities rationalizing this idea of social capital and\nWhat like what is the relationship between case studies such as is that\nUm that allow like oh no not no not necessarily allowed but enable like like the social capital really enable these two things to happen are there other reasons why these case studies um these things were able to happen\n[noise] Mm\nI think I mean I can spend as funny as much time reading papers [laughter] and um I probably should from my piece of a little bit unrelated but anyway um so I think that that's really interesting and you had to to know about the stress out now and example and to\nYeah to think about other places that they were unable to unable but like uninterested and making the same kind of decision um even though they weren't are tight knit community has [noise] and they have interesting for those who like their social capital in the sense of like in ... community like within your own community like how I think that that's a nominal risk but it's also like\nThinking about trust for institutions like regional planning for than the federal government and the ...\nSeeing as part of that um and I think I remember talking about this at some late are I think at some point last year when you were in the ... flashing out those ideas so I think there's a lot of interesting work there I'm definitely\nYeah so um if\nIf we kind of like her I kind of changed my when my topic was like I think there's this topic is really important but more generally more broadly I think I'm interested in this topic because I'm more and more around this idea of like what is real climate adaptation\nMe and when it comes to planning um I don't think any city in New York\nI think is one of one of the ... one of the cities that are doing a lot around um prepare climate change um [noise] I don't think any city is adapting\nAre planning for adaptation in a way that truly encompasses what\nIs going to happen to different types of people um and the very like basically as an assumption or as a baseline like\nWe need to move away from some of these places\nThat are at risk that for example like situation for example um revere you know like a stretch of the Cape like on the coast like these are areas that are really going to get flooded and is going to be more and more storms and so like how do you\nOne address the ... the the impact that is going to happen on these communities and then to address one's going to happen if you don't do anything about that if you don't plan for people's people to move\nThen people are going to move any way you see that I'm In Miami you see that\nIt was and I'm more and more people are more and more coastal properties are selling\nIt either in\nLike their tone of turnover rate is way higher than their market says or the price at which they are being sold as much lower and these are just like economic and monetary examples of how uh how property on the coast is\nLike beef mostly people are moving away regardless of whether or not we're planning for it and so where they go who who does that affect and who does that affect the most I think is a really important question to answer\nUm [noise] and so if that is my more broad question I think\nMore recently my thesis is kind of changed a little bit towards um how do you create a adequate model for climate adaptation planning and cities um the address to me to place equity at the forefront of what development means\nAnd so what why why what does this have to deal with New York I think uh one of the more fascinating things I've found is is a case study which is a ... point\nYes I'm a fan and I had a friend who man [noise]\n\n\nHaven't been in a way by\nThen in ...\nWhen you
