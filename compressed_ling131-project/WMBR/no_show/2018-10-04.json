good laughs together usually at our own expense um and used the time we had with each other to keep each other going in trying to address\nThe um the plight of homeless people I'm\nOn the agenda of the Massachusetts people that they didn't become completely invisible\nAnd that started back in the seventies um where we were trying to find ways to address the institutionalization and the growing homeless population on a street particular for us at that time is women on the street\nAnd kept started Rosie's Place and went around the country to look at places that um um were\n... housing homeless people are sheltering homeless people at the time to see what might be the best way to um to help people\nTipping friend would eventually launched the poor people's United fund which continues its work raising money and awareness\nBefore all that the two visited ... the day in New York City to see the famous social activist and cofounder of the Catholic Worker movement and to

fresh bread every day\nFor ... women who came to the to a rosy place and that's why she gave it that name she wanted to\nStarted goes he's place and we started just a misery rating with one another about things that we were seeing around the city and said what can we do how can we do war to make sure people just don't become invisible\nJump ahead nearly forty years in two thousand and seven mark

gotten up and given speeches to civilians and laypeople and religious leaders and you know just said what's on your mind and basically said uh you've given speeches for instance the conferences and said why do we need conferences we need people left in the streets helping poor people\nIn the context of of all of that I mean what what do you want to say today in two thousand in ... and seven where many of the same problems you were addressing in the sixties and seventies or either it's still there were worse\n[noise] yeah I think I Want to go back one second to um the or honorary degrees I did get several of them but\nAs a great friend of mine said to me give me they wanted to put you in jail but they gave you a degree in that [laughter]\nThat that's kind of where all of that that I'm

to go to the brothers in good shape jak ready your party has officially your brothers used to be good to see Jack ...\nThere's only one ... one possibility is meant\nOut there\n\nJust played together\nAnd this is the thin democracy mix\nSo [noise] and we are screwed [noise]\nScrewed screw\nThe twenty first century slang term for being in trouble indeed yes in fact one might say we are exceedingly screwed\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nI grew up in this country believing that I didn't hear that democracy I didn't realize that I'd have to create and for me the foundational question of democracy is voice who has voice um and so the problem is I see it can best the\nBest be understood in this metaphor that we're all invited into a big auditorium were all told that we have the right to speak but\nA few people can bring into auditorium some very expensive electronic megaphone and they're blasting out and yeah sure I\nHave the right to speak but no one can hear me and that is the state we're in now with we were saying oh what do you mean you know we all have the right to speak but the role of money in our political system is so huge\nThat the voices of ordinary people the vast majority of us feel practically speaking no one can hear us [noise]\n[noise]\n\nRight [noise] [noise]\nI say living democracy the distinction I'm making is between the thin democracy over here that it's fairly and dangerous if something done to us or for us it's a rigid structure that we simply inherit it's finished it's done it in place we can export it living democracy is very different\nLiving democracy is open ended it's not a new isn't it's not a new manifesto a new credo it is a way of life is not a set system but it's a set of systems values that permeates all\nBut you know we don't have to create the new man and woman we have to know what these real needs of our ours and stop\nSuppressing them in fact call them out so living democracy\nIs the fusion of the values of inclusion\nOf fairness a mutual accountability so that it's no longer blaming George Bush or any individual uh it has taken responsibility for ourselves for remaking the rule that bring out the best enough and protect us from the worst [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nI came to conclude that there's only one thing powerful enough it is the hours of idea\nNow that might sound really strange to you the power of idea\nI'm saying ideas are more powerful than instincts we creatures animals as we are yeah but we are fundamentally creatures that in mind we create the world according size usually hold\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd it's not [noise] thoroughly interest is watching meaningless or programs on the radio\n[noise] I wrote a book for an older person and for younger princes in my life um [noise] the older person is a mentor of mine who is the daughter of Holocaust survivors and we would sit around chatting about news events and she kept saying they did is in Germany\nThey did this in Germany but then democracy over here that is failing and dangerous\nAnd it you know at that time I thought that this was not easy to say really extreme really rhetorical and I just disregarded it she kept saying they just Germany they did in Germany and she wasn't talking about the later years a\nNational social outcomes she was talking about the early years Nineteen thirty nine to thirty one Nineteen thirty two when Germany was a modern\nParliamentary democracy fragile one but\nIt would have been very recognizable to us Germany in the early thirties had pop stars and now has architecture in Paris fashion and civil rights organizations gay rights organizations sex education organizations ah\nYou know page six writers you know gossip columnists and we don't know what we're doing and it was a democracy and so she was talking about the very early pressures on a democracy legal pressures on a democracy by people who were intense on closing down deaths among [noise]\nWas totally wrong totally wrong on and I feel like it was done purposely\nWe don't know what you're doing [noise] can I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country and there are countries in deep trouble [noise]\nAnd of course that means we can hear diversity we only hear the views of those with those big microphones those big megaphones through blasting per year\nAnd make this problem\nWe will make America stronger death [noise]\nWe were married [noise] America prouder job [noise]\nWe're well on ... said for ... [noise] and we will\nI began reading even more about uh\nHow societies how democracies close down or how would be just that crack\nDown on the democracy movement so I read about Italy in the twenties and as always lose when he was a great innovator he sort of pioneers of technology is closing down a modern democracy [noise] um I read about Germany in the thirties as I mentioned about\nRussia in the thirties about\nEast Germany in the fifties Czechoslovakia in the sixties\nTina she's true in ... and I read about the Chinese cracked down on the democracy movement at the end of the eighties and what became completely clear to me\nIs that every would be despot every would be dictator whether they're on the left or the rights does the same thing there was a blueprint to closing down an open society are crushes\nMcAfee [noise]\nThe first thing every would be dictator does is to invoke a terrifying internal and external threat [noise] and very often this threat can be real and they'll hype it\nWould be desperate always done\nTo create a secret prison system where torture takes place\nThat is outside the rule of law and very often\n\nSo\nWe're just kind of incredibly fragile moment because democracies don't slows down like that in a kind of steady progressive line they closed down more\nIn what Malcolm Gladwell would cause a series of tipping points and so\nThen it reaches a point which democracy can no longer feel democracy but that point comes really fast when it comes so the first time that the state made it legal to torture people\nThat was one of his vertical line and you know the first time that this kid was teams are in Florida I think that was one of his vertical lines I was not surprised\nThey're bringing drugs they're bringing crime there right but I Will build a wall it'll be a great wall drug will not court ruled that white only\nWe can say what you want about the land you can say what you want this self aware\nThe total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United states\nAre\nCouple you know she she's been down or she can choose the down or\nWith those guys back then the media they are the lord\nI could stand up in the middle of such an avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any\nPosition for which\nHe's walking out like when they die but Maya Wang laughing like a bunch of them in the banks are bigger\nI remember when we just don't when we are going to make America great again ... or ...\nLa\nLa\n[noise]\nBut we're running for this offers no one it'd be like [noise] because [noise] they occupy a different reality it's pretty hot or\nNot [noise]\nToo many people\nA government becomes a drum do the\nRight\nTo be able to launder bothers you the kind you in New York [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] uh rent on time bomb bomb\nNow seem kindly\nPang da de da\nNa\n\n\nNa na I'm mad [noise]\n\nStudents and pardon me\nAllow me to ask why am I called upon to speak here today what have I or those I represent to do with your national independence or the great principals of political freedom and the natural justice embodied in that declaration of independence extended to us and them I therefore called upon to bring our home\nWell here's shakes and ours that an affirmative answer could be truthfully return to those questions then with my task light and my burden easy and delightful\nBut such is not the state of the case I say it was a sad sense of the disparity between us I Am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary fewer high independence only reveals the measurable distance between us\nThe blessings in which you use this day rejoice or not enjoyed and common\nThe rich inheritance of justice liberty prosperity and independence decreased by your father's is shared by you not by me [noise]\nThe sunlight that brought life than feeling to you as broad stripes and death to me this fourth of July is yours not mine you may rejoice I must more\n\n\nHow the liberal Democrats ship that double your job your best shot pay tax rate is if you don't get help and get your change\n[laughter] [noise]\n\nYeah they won't accept no common sense now they know they're not gonna pay it got nothing but couldn't come up and it's like that\nAnd the problem is and you know actually [noise]\nStop listening to the bombastic loud mouth Sean\nAre any capacity use their\nMuch return to regular order\nDemocracy [noise]\n\nYou're so right democracy is the worst form of government there in except for all of the other and why you have\nDo\nTo play is all I\n\n\nWMD are Cambridge [noise]\nYou're listening to sound and fury W.

game in\nBy a score seven to two a couple of mammoth home runs\nHit by a a Aaron Judge and a gene Carlos Stanton and they will be traveling to Boston pretty soon for friday's game one of the American league division series cross the red socks\nThis year and so all the folks who wanted a a monumental Red Sox Yankees showdown or going to get that in a five game series starting friday think game time seven thirty on friday [noise]\n\nA righty so [noise]\nHotel workers affiliated with the UNITE HERE union here in Boston it's local twenty six are on strike it primarily affects\nSeven Marriott Hotels\nIn Boston and one of the one of the reasons\nThe the the um the the rallying cry for this strike right now is that one job should be enough so it happens according to the union um is that in the off season months like in the winter when not a lot of people are coming to Boston\nThese workers get laid off and then hire back later in the year the following year in the spring and summer when there's lots of uh people coming to stay in hotels [noise] um\nBut when they get ... or or they're\nThey don't really they don't technically get laid off they just their shifts are diminished\nAnd what what the union is saying is that they're losing folks are losing their benefits during the slow times of the year\nUh regardless of the of the time of the year workers need their benefit you get sick any time during the year for instance\nAnd so a hotel workers with UNITE HERE are on strike now they're not on strike just in Boston\nAnd ah unfortunately for a number\nRadio and tied cast producers there are on strike out there in Chicago against the Hyatt chain and the third coast conference which take my word for it is a pretty um important\nConference for folks who get together and network over a radio and pod casting [noise]\n\nAnd a third coast there's a competition you can submit a peace to the competition and there's prizes and its conferences a lot of networking and workshops and you can go to you can go to I Believe it's third coast dot org\nAnd uh take a look listen\nUh two previous conferences and learn a lot about uh about writing and ... and and and speaking and producing a radio and podcasts anyway the third coast conferences this weekend and the workers\nAt the hotel or on strike in Chicago at the high end where the conference is taking place so this is causing consternation up the was due for all up for a lot of these producers in pod casters many of whom support unions and going to want to support unions\nAnd if you go to the conference now it's not it's not inexpensive it's like a ... it's five hundred dollar ticket to go to this conference plus you have to pay for your hotel and food and travel and all that and the cost about a thousand dollars if you're coming from Boston or when all is said and done but you also have to cross the picket line\nOr it's making people very uncomfortable I been\nStation called the association of independence and radio and um\nThe Chicago Tribune\nReported a said dimitrius Jackson a convention services worker at the Hyatt Regency said despite the hardship on his family he and his wife Jackie ... castle\nJackson will continue striking\nA\nUntil in agreement is reached Jackie McCaskill Jackson works and hotel housekeeping and previously has been laid off during the winter months we've made personal sacrifices pain what few bills we can the south shore resident said we get paid out of the strike fund\nBut that's a fraction of what we make it to sacrifice we have to make these hotels have made billions of dollars and we're just trying to get our just do\n[noise] so uh that sort of the the context at least from the from the union side uh one of the journalists are planning on attending the conference contacted\nA a ... a management at the at the Hyatt and\nAh reports that there\nThey were up last night til like two thirty in the morning and then they started again at one o'clock this this afternoon trying to negotiate a new contract and and uh and to a brings the workers are\n[noise] part of the problem that a lot of people are reporting is that uh the organizers of the as the organizers of the third coast conference didn't tell people\nThat they that that the workers at the hotel rod strike they've not strike for a month for a month\nYou know in three weeks ago if you had known this you might have been able to make arrangements maybe not go to the conference and\nYou can cancel up until like the day you were planning on arriving to the hotel which I think for most people would be a to actually today or tomorrow so conferences this weekend\n[noise] uh\nAnd so they're also trying to if the strike is continuing through the weekend the organizers of the conference has this they're trying to create a satellite location so people do not have to cross the picket lines\nOr because you know this would I mean this this is a lot of these people report\nWorkers and workers issues and do not want to be known as someone who you know cross the picket line or some of these folks who go to these conferences or in the Screen Actors guild and ... and ... and other unions\nBut uh I I think\nThe conclusion that I Want to draw here is that it's important for those who cover issues to actually get close in their personal lives to these issues rather than\nParachuting into it to a to a neighborhood to cover something were to cover it ah from an academic standpoint it's important to know the real people are affected by these real issues\nUh we'll keep our eyes on that one maybe we'll have further information next week after the conference on what transpired but organizers\nThe cook criticism is the organizers should have told people sooner or who who didn't hear about the strike it hasn't been widely reported I mean the globe just reported that the workers were going out at a and mad Mariette even though UNITE HERE has been striking around the country for a month [noise]\nAnd you know I don't have a cheap yeah\nBecause you know I'm not sure you all\nAnd and you're talking\nYear\nAnd a ball\nThey try\n[noise] I don't\nPaul Iran China

blood transfusion before July Nineteen Ninety two chances are I'd buy you some time\nOccupy Sandy volunteers worked in partnership with local community organizations and activists networks and their grassroots effort focused on empowering poor and working class community\nWith nearly sixty thousand volunteers at its height its own online relief registry a legal team a medical team a team of translators prescription drug deliveries had serving around twenty thousand meals a day occupy Sandy is considered one of the most effective relief efforts in said [noise]\nI didn't know too much about occupy new orders Occupy Wall street I mean I grew up in the sixties or understand approaches and activism and all of that and I just didn't understand what they're at that time in Manhattan I didn't understand what their goal\nBut when they came here to Rockaway it was very obvious with the goal\nAnd I really believe that the slogan a better world\nAnd I saw the sword and actually\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to making contact and the special broadcast that episode one from the pod cast series the response thanks to the general ... like you making contact has offered for free to radio stations in the U.S Canada and Australia and South Africa [noise]\nMake sure you don't miss out on behind the scenes and folk and our next president against that radio project outward and see the stay in touch section on the right [noise]\n\n\nAnd now that episode one of the response [noise]\n\n\nIn her book paradise built in hell\nAuthor Rebecca ... describes the idea of disaster collective ism is quote the sense of immersion in the moment and solidarity with others caused by the rupture in everyday life and emotion grave or than happiness but deeply positive\nShe goes on to say quote we don't even have a language for this emotion in which the wonderful comes wrapped in a terrible joy and sorrow courage and fear we cannot welcome disaster but we can value the responses both practical and psychological\nCells immersion in the community that spontaneously formed after Sandy gave him a new sense of possibility this is the situation that people often find themselves in during the aftermath of disasters this falling away of everyday normalcy opens up the space for the creation of unlikely connections\nHurricane Sandy hit I was living in Fort Greene in Brooklyn this is Terri Bennett we were out earlier in the evening and made the kind of\nBeing I think I had gone to the store and gotten some like beans beer and toilet paper to stock up anything the ordinary it happened which in retrospect was not really a solid emergency plan but at the time [laughter] it seems to me like what I should do\nThe next day when you look up a we were looking at the news and the first thing I actually saw I'm originally from New Jersey as I saw images of the Jersey shore and they're really iconic image of the roller coaster that was in the ocean and that was the first indication that something\nReally serious had happened slowly I started hearing about different kind of relief efforts primarily\nPeople establishing distribution centers and people are starting to get donations together and at the time we had a Fifteen foot cargo van those empty and we had a full tank of gas\nSo we went to one of the distribution points which turned out was operated in part by occupy Sandy and so we took the first van load of stuff down to the Rockaways\nDistribution point and Terry's neighborhood directed her to a specific we leave hop on the Rockaway Peninsula\nWhere that place turned out to be was a place called ... which stands for you are never alone in which was\nSelves nonprofit that was destroyed after the storm and so that's where he went every morning for a long time after the storm and there is kind of a joke that I had like a little travelling office because they had they took bags with a bunch of\nDifferent clip boards in it with a list of every house we'd been too and the people and how many people lived in the house and held the people who are who lived in the house\nTerry already had a background in the marshalling of relief efforts and she quickly became an important part of the recovery process creating an organization called respond and rebuild which was\nYou specialize in coordination with volunteers and supplies needed to go where and what quantity the kind of thing that's always changing moment to moment this was the sort of thing that occupy Sandy actually sell that despite or perhaps because of its loosely organized and flexible structure\nCherries project alone locked well over forty thousand volunteer work hours and worked on over four hundred homes she put an incredible amount of time and energy into actually making personal connections with the folks she was helping and she wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty\nWhen they're first driving around and just have this huge neon yellow van has a sign that said we can pump you out I think [laughter] and it just had my phone number and so right across the street from Ghana was a couple who is a retired cop and her husband\nAnd we'd heard that they had water in their basement and so we kind of pull up with this big yellow van looking like we looked which is like we hadn't slept for days or showered or changed our clothes you know they show up and we're like we heard you need your basement pumped out\nAnd made their basement out and it was the first has to be pumped out and so this couple turned out to become friends of ours and kind of unlikely friends of ours I don't have a lot of friends who are retired cops but I don't know yet that we developed a lot of unlikely friendships and we had a situation where we had\nThis kind of unlikely group of friends who are really appreciative of all the volunteers who are coming down and started you know they're just they're people who is homeless just destroyed after a disaster and they decided [laughter]\nThey really were invested in having these volunteers well taken care of and just I guess to kind of people they are right but they started having just a cooler on their front porch that constantly had like\nSodas and water and they had bagels or they had pizza that they would just leave on their front porch that volunteers could just come and eat you know and despite the fact that their home and just been destroyed\nSo she said to me\nA month before the storm if I Would have seen people looking like [laughter] I wouldn't have given them directions for the train but then a month after the storm had given you choose to my house and um\nI think those kind of experience has really changed how we experience New York and like what my community in New York meant and it really came diversified but my community in New York meant\nOccupy Sandy wasn't your average relief effort\nInstead of seeing themselves as a charity organization occupy volunteers saw themselves as participants in a process of mutual aid\nA concept that rejects the savior victim dichotomy that often exists in relief work and which instead emphasize is working with communities in a horizontal way blurring the line between what we traditionally considered to be victims and volunteers\nI really felt that it was important that we put\nThe affected people's experience first so asking people what they needed and asking people what they wanted and asking people how they wanted that to work it was really important to me that this huge outpouring of concern and willingness and labor\nWas accountable to the people who needed help right and so\nI think a lot of the reason we were able to sort of connect with people and have our efforts kind of snowball is that like we had this little clip whereas when we were asking you to fill out a form and we weren't doing something that felt impersonal and we weren't stopping you from telling us what was going wrong because there's no\nBox to check off and we just listened right and so if\nYou're going for his mutual aid some kind of mutual recognition is the first thing that's required\nThis kind of approach couldn't be more different from the relief efforts organized by institutions like\nThese organizations could have been much more effective if they had worked in closer partnership with the groups under the Occupy Sandy banner\nUnsurprisingly there was a lot of tension between occupy volunteers in the official relief efforts this might have had something to do with occupies connection to radical politics and the different interests that are represented among grass roots versus official relief\nIn fact a lot of the time disaster recovery can be aimed at simply restoring the status quo as quickly as possible or worse at taking advantage of shock communities in order to advance and unpopular agenda\n[laughter] Aaron and Johnny Mara nice to be running around here are\nVery very hard to know you don't then we've been\nMarried and I got
