and never goes away I sound like Hillary Clinton because it is officially fall I Know it didn't feel like fall for a while but now it does and I'm cold\nTrying to figure out what exactly I'm going to do for you here tonight because my Vogel capabilities are limited but this is in that sense of talk show\nI think a normal person would have a broad someone onto the show to dialogue with or to dominate the conversation maybe but no I have to have to be on your I have to make excessive use of uh\nThe metaphorical cough but now as I don't have one of those and I have to spread my own as the rest of the community because it's not really a radio station was everyone\nIt's alright I probably have picked up a more diseases from this microphone and I've transmitted to you know I think that it's good karma right\nOr the more diseases you accept than the than like compared to the amount that you um\nPass on I don't know I'm not religious so I don't know what that means\nAnd last year my mom I Am religion\nHuh [laughter] that's funny right anyway here's a song or ...\nYears [laughter] he's known\nBy a guy down saying\n\nNow that was um the sound of silence by ... notes it's uh it's actually one of my one of my favorite songs because it's so versatile really\nOr you could sit in anything you want if you want when you want to do it but um\nYeah I guess now you just surreal so this is a fire by or they're brown [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nArthur Brown with fire like a classic track really um by a man who sounds like you said she should have the title Reverend in front of his name wherever and Arthur Brown he will be to me\nIt's spooky time it's Halloween um so I have to make an obligation to Tory comments about that um it's October again\nWhich means that you're going to be spending more time indoors more time with your family and more time alone more time comforted by a radiator than ... instead of whatever pet a normal person would have\nAny way you feel like you're falling apart like not even just when your voice does that thing when you're kind of sick um but like in general [laughter] I'm twenty and I I I've not\nI did not anticipate this much wear and tear on my small small body my fragile frame\nI Am in pain and my head hurts and I decided\nTo get a flu shot anyway because I care about herd immunity so also my left arm hurts a little bit because in a good way\nI'm kinda into how a I'm not going to say that that's\nThat's not a good thing to say on there but not in a horrible feeling getting a vaccine maybe it feels great I Can't tell you to go get one but I really would and I did yeah\nOr or it's a my eyesight is getting worse for some reason which is strange because I wear contacts and you think maybe they would uh reshape my cornea but no\nIsn't this show or for cited that'd be a fun little twist 'cause nobody here as far as I Do 'cause we're all nerds who grew up reading and having things closer faces so we need glasses or contacts or um various assistance [laughter]\nI really wish I had a vision difficulties to the point where someone would feel sorry for me but no I have a very mild my hope yeah it's just enough that I Can't drive\nWhich is a little sad as a I went into the DMV at each Fifteen to get my permit is where I'm from and that's legal\nAnd uh got everything right but then I fell behind them because they didn't bring my glasses and I didn't want to have a corrective lenses on my permit I didn't want to be more with that for the rest of my life\nPassword to now in a few weird if I Can't see things believe it or not I need to see trees every time I get my prescription updated I'm surprised at how much I was missing\nI understand how I can sit here and talk to you and I'm hearing my voice and I normally ate the son and my boys which makes sense but right now it just sounds worse in a way like some people they get sick they get that raspy little like [noise]\nIt's a nice breath the year the strain and their voice and it's nice and it's a cute I like it I get sick and um I sound like this\nIs [noise] you don't have to know everything sounds a bit\nRude main maybe a a an an light and maybe maybe you feel like you should know everything I don't know but you don't you don't have to know everything\nI bring this up because uh there's there's been this trend people I'm not naming names because no names come to mind immediately but just because I don't have any proof doesn't mean it's\nWho have been ask questions about certain things and rather than saying I don't know enough about that to give you an answer the kind of piece together and answered that sounds like they do know about it this is a bad thing don't do this thing\nIf it's a trick you'll fall right into the trap it's not a trick than what benefit do you have to pretending like you know about a thing that you don't know about are you a politician\nAnd as more and more a private citizens\nYou know what the people that are running\nFor office right now than there are just a little more down to earth but I still think they're just politicians anyway\nMore and more people from Gen pop running for office so immigrate some of them you're going to vote for some of them are horrible day yes these questions and\nA feeling like they have to know the answer the answer it and that's the wrong move don't do that answer things you know the answer to and if your philosophy philosophical off or if your philosophical if you waver between things than\nMaybe say or do what you usually you would think about thing or had the caviar that you're not sure what you\nBelieve or you know just any kind of little way to let\nPeople know that you're not absolutely sure about what you're saying you can come across as quite the idiot if you think you need to know everything\nThis is coming from a person who doesn't know many things ah I Know my ZIP Code and address from back home I Know my\nI Know how to time my shoes but not in the way than adults do I time my shoes with little bunny ears that makes me cute I mean if I'm gonna run on that I Need all the help I can get\nSo moving on Segway and I've got a nice little no change\nHere that I'm going to I'm going to look at all you guys sit and wonder when I'm looking at me enjoy this for a second\nOh yes that's nice that's very nice uh from far away this would really creep somebody out yeah\nDo you think we're supposed to oversee our own brains\n\nYeah of course you have to get into the little what do you mean suppose too but what if our brains we're just supposed to not have been visible over and we broke some horrible rule when we decided to crack a school open and take a look\n\nI don't know the brands are interesting I'm a brain your brain probably if you're not a self driving cars I would've car listening to radio if it were driving itself now that's my decision I've decided that that's another thing that happens\nI'm looking at a photocopy of various views of the human brain\nAnd the parts are labeled a because I'm supposed to know all these parts and things by um [noise] one PM which is in less than twelve hours\nIt really is a Wednesday now didn't think about that next I retired\nReally easy uh in the wintertime and then in the fall because the dark ages creeps on up and next thing I Know I look outside six PM and it's dark and I'm Wondering\nI'm Still debate going to get food\n'cause I don't have any food I beans today I Know I'm off on climate change from their brain stuff but I eat I opened a can of field peas and I he did it on the stove to add a little bit of that stuff at flare not that uh uh Allah microwave stuff\nI heated up on the stove which just means I have an extradition that I Need to wash it's sitting on my desk in my room right now and next to the bowl that has a bean\nA juice residue that is in a very a foodie word but it's kind of being residue all over the sides of it and I didn't quite get around Washington out even though I'm gonna wake up tomorrow probably wants I'm an ice bowl of um\n[noise] a corporate cereal the best kind that I drink a with a regular milk non almond milk or a lactose free milk as I probably should but regular milk I'm a good old fashioned American regular milk girl\nAnd um if if I Move somewhere you might you might think of me is less of a patriot but no I Would be an ex patriot someone who was a patriot\nFully and now it's not less of one just not want any longer that's an ex patriot it means you can't convince me otherwise anyway ambience today because I realize that I hadn't had like a vegetable and quite a while and then I started wondering about if I had a protein\nAnd now is also now I'm mostly been living off of the talking and potato chips and er this weekend I bought a bag of those a powdered many doughnuts\nRight back into childhood those things will take you\nIt's all cooked chips and I place to delicately inside the empty during a bag and its sat there for a day or two because I don't have time to take the trash out apparently maybe I maybe I get self conscious about these kinds of things you can't\nIt's not right to judge me for that\nAnyway when I finally went to throw it out um\nIt's not like a funnel cake\nUnderstand how scientifically powdered sugar plus a potato chips and\nCould theoretically smell like a funnel cake\nBut our spiritual level I was deeply disturbed\nAnd I think part of my weekend plans this weekend or um to eat potato chip and powder donut at the same time to see if it tastes like fun OK\nYou got like the soft element from the donor you got the powdered sugar from the donor you got the sweet from the donor then you've got the sort of referred texture the exterior that follow cake and the salty fried flavor in the chip and I'm\n\nProbably a great idea yeah I mean I'm definitely going to do that once I get through this whole week that it never seems in folks [laughter]\nIt's Tuesday It's Wednesday now praise Jehovah It's Wednesday I'm able to probably one of my job is to is actually of the week I have three classes to wake up and a nine booth who\nProbably have to wake up earlier because I don't know these brain things but we'll see about that\n[noise] It's Wednesday or something\nSaid in the church may\nYeah\nMean the way to being the dream but\nMay not be\nCannot hide I'm a little\nFaster\nI\nGo ahead and do something that you\nAndrea Benjamin cake cutty by design it's not that album and Scott kid could easily in the dark but he's purple\nAnd is is a bare chested out but his pants or blue interesting when he does with color there\nAnd back fabulous is scheduled broadcast I'm entering its very first season after um a couple to several seasons of a different show the night to rest in peace latchkey sounds you probably won't be miss\nI found that I'm putting together a playlist of songs even as white of John right as an alternative it's difficult every week you put together this plea lives and\nAnd you don't want to overplay songs you don't replace songs and next thing you know you're listening to songs and you're like ah I don't loaded without it\nBecause they need to play a song that's not a good way to do radio you should love the songs that you play after all if you don't love it like in the passive listen or\nThey're not gonna love it more than you will most likely\nAnd if they do they'll probably uh download it\nAnd I'll listen to it several more times maybe go to a concert by that or is you can't predict human behavior but you can model it with certain certain software\nWe're all algorithmic anyway\nDon't intend to influence you're buying\nThat I truly truly could not live without especially in times like this it can be ah the months from October to June\nI'm through laws and she has\nA beautiful invention I it makes my mouth the little number that's okay 'cause I I really need to be offered well these next few days I Know a lot of stuff going on I got people people counting on me\nPeople really need me in there doing my thing in order for their thing to work\n\nIt's really interesting because uh it seems like everyone's having a baby right now\nOr had a baby my one of my best friends from high school who I guess we parted ways on a sour note I'm not sure she scientists disappeared but um she recently in a baby she's twenty\nAnd if I if she is similar to how she was in high school I'm a little concerned but\nMy dad bothered me despite his um his checkered ... and I guess that means that you\nCan also be a wonderful mother to child who she posted on Instagram I'm with the caption what a pain in The Vagina\nOh that that's classy parenting right there cannot wait for him to grow up and see\nThat it was called a respectability politics\n\nDo you want to hear a funny word here it is it's\n[laughter] it's a\nPart of the front of your brain it's in the front of your brain sort of in the middle part the gooey stuff but there is like a hard part beneath I'll do Easter\nYou wouldn't know unless you've been in there but there are various gestures and it's kinda crazy that that's what controls us pilots us and that's the essence of who we are and that's how we perceive everything and it's how we move how we feel how we taste\nI think I taste great um since though not that much\nI get really good for some bread right now and you know when I'm craving bread where else would I go besides the bread store or the Brits or [laughter]\nYeah I I have another song for you because I Know that would be more

I'm not like switching up very much by playing music from him instead of Radiohead but I guess this is\nMy version of variety [laughter] butts he's released a string of a few\nSingle I guess over the past few weeks\nAnd I think it has something to do with the soundtrack for a movie maybe\nI'm ...\n... is that the name of the movie I I'm not really sure but this son I'm playing is called has ended\nAnd\nThe sons are all [noise] well I mean obviously they're all\nReally cinematic and ice in it ... the atmosphere ... and\nI'm\nStill kind of like amazed at how good the songs were 'cause obviously I was expecting means to be like\nCrazy good because it's time to work but some house too [laughter] um I was surprised that goes [noise] um I how good they were which is ridiculous um yeah so this song is called has ended\nAnd hope it gives you some nice dramatic movie vibes maybe\nIf you're like in your car and our ... can be all dramatic and look out the window pretended six on checking your life [laughter] right now at seven in the morning so\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\nA ... and I have\nMe I'm On\nAnd tiny scissors and nail down\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[laughter] yeah [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] bringing them\nDo the\nOut in the game\nYou can choose to God\nOn\nMan\n\n\n\nOh\n\nI Know\nThat have\nAnd\nWay to get\nGuy\n\n\n\nYou were listening to chemistry one on one on WNPR and\nYou just heard a new song actually every summer just played was released in\nThe past month about so new stuff um that when you just heard is from club crew and it's called forty nine years\nYeah pretty much every time they release a new song I end up playing pretty faithfully\n'cause they never really fell for me and rich before that was for me lays\nFrom from the band magic potion I don't know about the title\nBut that is one of several songs that they have released recently and it appears that an album from them is imminent I'm guessing so\nWe shall see [laughter] but that was the one that I liked the most out of what they released so far and\nThen I put anyone from phony people\nA lot of other fundamentals have weird capitalization and punctuation stuff going on which kinda annoys me a bit [laughter]\nWhen artist kind of over ... [laughter] it's like their name or their song titles but I guess with them I don't mind\nEspecially because the music is so good and I definitely prefer their songs that have a bit less going on and that are kind of smoother like the one I played\nAnd\nThen the first song was the new song one of the new songs from Tom York\nHas ended that's the name of the song yeah okay so\nNow I have another new songs to some really acceptable because it is from pond\nRuined my all time favorite bands after that that doesn't even describe how much I Love him [noise] but\nYeah the song is called sixteen days and it was kind of\nI guess they're they're more up beat dial it's kind of the sound of their last of them the weather combined with\nA couple of the crazier ones from metaphysics base again such as dawned are it's like ... similar to that track\nThink of any more of my head or no butts\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nHe\nHe\n\n\n\n\n\nDe de\nDe\n\nDe\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n[noise] you wouldn't think to country one on one and\nThe song you just heard is from seven yet Seventy nine point five new album predictions which has actually been off for a couple of weeks now but I didn't really get to its last week [laughter] so\nNow I'm playing a song from it and that one's called sisters unarmed which has like a nice message I guess\nAnd\nMaybe close to half of the songs on the album where either released a singles or they had out just the from before\nSo I guess everybody heard\nEven like half the material on there but I'm super super happy to be finally came up with a full album because prior to this they had I think two or three songs actually officially released and\nThey're really amazing live they have towards several times but you kind of Batman kind of acting as their ... and opening for them several times I guess\nA really lo fi song from exploded view and songs called sleepers and I think I'd be like completely wrong but\nI think\nThat\nIs on secret bonus record label which is also the same record label that's the holy drew a couple is on so pretty much anytime I see any other album\nWith a theory I Try and go on it I guess\nI'm like oh I Know this would be good [laughter] so\nAnd then\nOh it's before that was the song from Arthur ... who is this Brazilian singer and some is from the early seventies I think and it's called ... I don't know for the company ...\nBut\nI've been listening to view the songs and I find them the Supreme Lee relaxing and guitars just really really nice\nAnd\nDo have to credit finding that song to the artist final Williams which talked about a few weeks ago 'cause he makes really ... and then the new song from pond sixteen date\nSo the next thing you'll hear is from this band from the nineties bark psychosis\nI'm I don't see really little about them right now\nAnd hope you enjoy\nMm\n\nMm Mm\nMm\nMm Mm\n[noise]\n\n\nYou my friend have connections in the government in yes new usa Don go into the official source for government information on thousands of topics and like any good connection there is no telling where it can take you\nWhy one day you're getting student loan in preventing the next thing you know you need jobs would keep tabs in today's road construction into we could have used searching for telecommuting ideas Maro do the more you use you as a dog in the more uses your mind for a\nPassport applications for example today been known to lead to a sudden interest in travel advisories are new mobile apps will even up to you on the go blue\nOr whether you have the information to get more ideas to give your government the checkout usa dot Gov who knows lottery results today could lead to retirement planning\nConnections there's no telling where you can do\n\nGood morning [noise]\nYou're listening to W.

photographer for the\nUm cover every musician\nYeah it wasn't necessarily intentional I started it started with ... and I um\nLike genius guitar musician um\nWe met at a show called woman if letters that my friend Trish Nelson producers at the public theater in New York I'm\n... so she had just spoken and we had a conversation afterwards and\nDecided to work on her record\nA together after that conversation and um\nYeah it just between the people she brought in and I brought in she her one of our good friends Aaron ... um is a\nExtraordinary a mixing engineer who's like I think [noise]\nAbout to peak um\nUm she's like\nThis county's ... so he did a lot of\nAnd make like a U.S as Mara the\nEsperanza Spalding record 'em as well so she's got like some really great projects behind her um\nAnd yeah it just ended up\nOne woman after another it's like All right we let let let's just like seal the deal and like um\nLock in that trend for the rest of the album\nEspecially now I think in the music industry uh women are still very much under represented a despite how far we've come on just like making space for us there's still\nA lot a long ways to go yeah I Hope\nYeah [laughter] um\nIt was kind of like a practice what you preach kind of thing like if I Want to see a diversity of or if I Want to see like more marginalized people represented like when when one is in the position to\nUplift to other people then like I think we should\nYeah [laughter]\nYeah and this is your first to where they seem to agree\nThis is my first tour of all of them are quite a few tours with her full piece band\nI think this might be her first like solo tour in the north east and it's definitely our first tour together [laughter] um\nSuch a wonderful experience um\nKnow what

yeah\nYeah\n\n\nThis latest episode\nIn which the journalist for the\nWashington Post a Saudi national buddy us residents with children that are American citizens uh was told to go to turkey to get the paper if he needed for his\nDivorce so he could remarried and ah when he went in he did not come out alive\nAnd so for the last ah almost two weeks the Saudi Government denied that it knew anything they've said he came in and he came out of course there was no camera footage of him having left and his fiance had been waiting and waiting and waiting\nAt looks like now they're going to announce that indeed they didn't kill him but it was an accident it was done right by rogue elements in the government even they were supposed to kidnap him and bring him back to Saudi Arabia or things went badly and instead he was killed\nMaybe on summarize horse a bit about Donald Trump and his administration's response to the allegations against Saudi Arabia for the charge with the murder just isn't a journalist Jamal ...\nThere has been quite an outcry in the United states even from very conservative Republican Congress people like Lindsey Graham or who said there would be hell to pay or like Marco Rubio who said we'd have to recalibrate our relations with Saudi Arabia\nMy from Donald Trump first it has been silenced than it was down\nSales because that's jobs and a lot of money and the uh those orders would just go to the Chinese and the Russians and then he throughout this idea of maybe it was a rogue element which really set the stage for what the Saudis are going to make up now as their excuse\nSo oh long he's been trying to either make this story go away or cover it up\nMy ... in your view what is the proper response of the United states here to ah we're almost certainly was the death of this journalist draw control what should the United states to be doing here\nThey should certainly be cutting off not only on weapons sales to Saudi Arabia but immediately stopped\nA aiding and abetting the Saudis and the horrendous war in Yemen they should impose sanctions on anybody who is involved in this\nA heinous act and killing the\nA journalist um they should stop 'em intelligence cooperation with the Saudis and uh I think then there's also an issue about businesses and businesses\nReally should severed ties particularly those businesses that are hired to be foreign agents in the Saudi Government and they're over two dozen of them I and then\nThere's also the responsibility of the think tanks the\nUniversities in the United states it receives Saudi money and the high tech companies that have been courting large investments from the Saudis are all these kind of connections really need to be rethought and then on the larger issue\nOf what really wouldn't be the uh positive silver lining that could possibly come from all of this is a rethinking of U.S policy that has been one\nIn states into wars and the end up put the United states on a collision course with the run that uh is hurting many Iranians because of the Internet calling in sanctions but could also lead us to another war there\nSo I think with the American public now having somewhat of an understanding of how it oppressive Saudi Arabia is perhaps it is a moment when we could create some distance between us policy and the interests of the Saudi Government\nThat was my idea of Benjamin cofounder of ...

T. L. online dot org\nAnd it's sobering report released by the un Intergovernmental Panel on climate change or IPC on October eighth\nThe world's leading climate scientists issued a dire warning that the nations of the world have only at ten to twelve year window to take action to limit an increase in global temperatures below one point five degrees centigrade\nThe report concludes that an increase beyond one point five degrees will substantially increase the likelihood of disastrous drought wildfires crop failures flooding extreme weather events in coral reef destruction\nThe report lays out the case for urging international action to limit a rise in global warming to reduce carbon in greenhouse gas emissions the recommended measures include increasing the cost of burning fossil fuels re forest station\nChanges in land use moving to electric powered transport systems and the adoption of carbon capture technology\nYour reporters spoke with Michelle Chan friends of the earth vice\nThe political obstacles in the U.S where President Trump and the Republican Party there controls all branches of government refuses to acknowledge or take action to address climate change\nIn twenty Fifteen at the Paris climate talks countries agreed to a couple of goals and the first one was to limit the increase in global average temperature to\nTwo degrees below pre industrial levels and then the second goal is to try to stay under one point five degrees centigrade and so this report which was prepared by hundreds of scientists under the auspices of the I. P. C. C. or the inter governmental panel on climate change\nThis report was done in order to describe how the impacts on earth and two people would be different between these two different scenarios to degree temperature warming\nVersus one point five degrees of warming\nAnd so that was what the report set out to do and one of the things that the report says is that you know even if the world doesn't emit one additional kind of greenhouse gases even if we were just stop today that were already on a path\nTo increase in global average temperature is by one degree and this level we have to remind ourselves\nAt this level people are already suffering and dying because of climate impacts and then the report goes on to describe what would happen that difference between one point five degrees of warming and two degrees of warming and I can get into a couple of examples if you'd like\nCould you cover for us some of the most dire warnings here that where the consensus of scientists across the world\nRight well they go through um a number of their friends project that impacts between the one point five versus two degrees scenarios and for example if we only one by one point five degrees Celsius then it means that sea level rises won't be as high\nAnd on and people are already you know what the essentially forced to move\nAt one point five degrees that science says that will lose maybe Seventy percent of our coral reefs instead of Ninety nine percent of them so I mean one point five even though that's the goal of the world is shooting for\n... still is I'm I've hopping Lee devastating for the state of our coral reefs in our oceans but at one point five degrees of warming instead of that too we can help prevent what scientists call feedback loops the feedback loops create run away climate change\nSo one example here is that um Arctic snow being white has the ability to bounce back the sun's rays into space and the more Arctic snow we lose then the more the earth absorbs that heat and then the more melting is caused and then there's less snow and less\nSunlight reflected back in so that just creates a vicious cycle or a a feedback loop and so\nThat report goes and interest chronicles all of these different scenarios I'm likely scenario is likely impacts between one point five and two degrees and it's very very sobering to to say the least um [noise] it says that technologically if we go over one point five degrees\nThen we will need to increasingly rely on technologies that sucks carbon out of the air and a lot of these technologies are just completely unproven and they could be hugely risky\nWilma show when you look at the advisory here to the world in terms of the dramatic action that will be necessary to stay under that one point five degrees centigrade rise in temperature across the world\nHow realistic is it that that could actually happen in terms of political will a technology alternative fuel systems and the like\nThat concludes tonight's news you can join us again tomorrow night and every week night at five thirty here an WMD are for half an hour\nThe radio coming up or near and far I\nThink it might be the greatest city whatever it is in them because they don't go away\nFor the W envy argues department and ... going to have a great thing and\n[noise]\nAnd [noise] [noise] ...\n\nYou and me are keen vans\n[noise]\nLong surprising is near and far or do you live longer morally right wing\nShow the pitchers local music\nJapanese hip hop is more music from near as large background you've got a little groove man John you were start off with a song by a local band sidewalk driver or their plans friday night monger rode their song\nOr dancing with her boyfriend long long\nKeep it a lot to your host you sidewalk driver\nAnd long [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] you know what I mean these [noise]\nThe big the bigger dog bill\nFor your call and then it\nGoes out and go out and you can do about that [laughter] and do\nDi di di da da da da na ...\nI don't know I think back to\nDa da da da da da\nDa da di di\nDi di di di\nDi di da da da da da da da da da da and a woman [laughter]\nGoing on [laughter]\nOr a better job [laughter] I'm really are and writing in order to really like\n...

O. yeah every Monday yeah\nAnd he like actually quite a few uh accomplishments on that\nYou live long enough [laughter] the lists gets longer\nAs you have a year you do you write columns for Boston hung on DVD Q A newspaper a windows Cambridge chronicles and opinion for the Boston Globe yeah yeah\nSo how did you get selected to do um for anyone for new listeners Justinian thank you for listening um but uh we're talking about the we'll be talking today about the sanctuary cities a symposium that's being hosted by that came to just start off his id next Thursday on October twenty fifth I'm going to say like a hundred more times evening\nUm but uh and Reverend Irene Monroe is the\nModerate the power yeah yeah so how did you get tapped\nI'm delighted to get ... to ... you know a lotta times I get asked to um to moderate a panels I'm and I'm I don't ask any questions which I say thank you particularly if it's a topic that that I'm very moved by\nAnd being a Cambridge resident and the whole issue around immigration and and ... and what is sanctuary for for people who are actually looking for political asylum as well as those of us who have lived here and and what does that mean and I\nI Would say a changing demographic where we we're seeing gentrification ah with big farmer\nAnd the biotech this is becoming one of those little hubs here than the sort of northeast quadrant of the United states you have\nYou know old Cambridge and then you have a new you know bump a group of folks some because of work certainly school because of MIT and Harvard and and and as I say you and we do have immigrant so there's a tussle here\nUh in terms of how do we make\nCambridge which is known as a world class city in it\nAnd have a sense of belonging and it's a transient city too because I I mean when you have students like MIT and Harvard and Leslie and I think Cambridge College there's already a demographic group that is always sort of in flux but we're talking about residents like myself homeowners and stuff like that\nYou know how how do we keep sort of the the flare that we call the People's Republic of Cambridge uh and and yet welcome in New folks so that they can also bring their particular the their identity and helped shape you know this sort of cosmopolitan city\nMhm yeah I think that's a big question about\nUm you know honoring what something is but also allowing it to change and\nAh when I was speaking to I think he's now the head of um the Cambridge Historical Society she was talking about how historical societies often get initiated 'em when they when they were initiated you know like you know a hundred a hundred years ago I unfortunately the\nUh the impetus for those things are very uh you know phobic origins you know they Oh absolutely yeah but they came out just reckless eighty today is a very different organization I'm In is trying to uh and it doesn't have the same goals as before you know has singles of like I'm\nCertainly documenting the history of the people who live in Cambridge but a very holistic view whereas before it was you know very selected of you know who they\nWhen I was pretty ... yeah you know and I think I think another thing is I mean when we when we think about a Cambridge is we think about Boston is we think about\nThe pilgrims and and stuff I mean he was very monolithic at absolutely homogeneous in that sense I I think what I like about the the Cambridge Historical Society which is why I'm honored here is that they're looking\nYou do come from all over the world and what does that mean as opposed to you know I grew up in an era where we we liked to say you know to assimilate and assimilate at the expense of losing your identity so we're we're we're doing so I uh I'm so glad that that kind of um discourse has been dismantled [laughter]\nDeceased here but you know the issue around diversity\nOf somewhere in the last one being what being from them okay being from somewhere I Love it okay so and the question is where do I see Cambridge yeah oh for myself\nAnd you can talk we can be how about Cambridge and I'm a girl from Brooklyn so I Will never give up that descriptor vet I I'm I'm certainly a a part of Cambridge because of my just activism and I and I and I belong here you know I've been here long enough\nUh uh that that it is that it is home for me I've invested not only in terms of you buy a house here but you invest in terms of just you ... you know the the civic activities that you engage it and stuff so um\nYeah I I I'm I'm but belonging is is the bigger issue you know 'cause you can be a part of something and still be sort of a ...\nYou can be part of something but not fully engaged in it ah but ah belonging that now that's a much more difficult a question because\n... it to me it conjures up a lot of stuff um\nI I Belong here because I have a right to be here you know even if people don't want me here you know I I Belong here you know that that's a really that's that's one to really an a to sort of unpack\nYeah I think that's interesting we um that's\nThat was that was something we were trying to get to the root of last time was\nWhich of these come from the internal and which of these come from the external\nUm [noise] as far as like you know\nBelonging like you were you born\nBut that doesn't matter mhm whereas for someone else like that would perhaps you know affect yeah that I I question because the ... when someone say something like if you for instance I'll give you an example so in two thousand I\nProfessor Henry gates who uh of of of Harvard uh was arrested because uh I'm a white woman call the cops but white people to call them the black people you know and it but but Bush let's talk about that they they're calling all the cops on black folks\nBecause they feel they don't belong and so so this white woman that lives on the same block on where street where professor gates that at at once resulted I'm calling because she saw this black man\nGoing into this house and she automatically her go to place was he doesn't belong\nHe's breaking into this house and it's it's it's signals like why would someone black be here on this block you know um and it it it it it's really interesting so that's an interesting question because\nEvery call that we've heard on the radio every every reporter I'm saying that we've heard on the radio where white person has called on a black person they're saying you don't belong here whether that's the golf course whether that's your own apartment\nA you know whether that's you in a car with two white kids you don't belong here you don't belong you should not be doing this and so uh that's that is really what I'm hoping\nOur discussion next week\nWe'll hit upon do people feel they belong here because when a number of folks have said they've walked the streets they're they're they're immigrants and people have said you don't belong here they hear an accent\nShen I mean the question for the Cambridge Historical Society this year is whereas Cambridge from and that question where are you from is a very broad question for some evil and on this show like I Try to\nCreate a space for people to talk about their experiences with that question um because for a lot a lot of times it's a very invasive question it's ... it's not a it's it's a question where someone's trying to categorize you because they've decided that\nYou must not be from here from somewhere else and the second you asked someone that question and their answer does not satisfy\nYou that's right you're not asking a genuine question right right that's right and so I so yeah I think that I think there's no way that that topic can't come up with that\nYou know or that the\nThat question of like to do people feel like they belong here yeah it has its it's huge it's huge in this conversation\nOh yeah I mean we see it played out in in in in in various ways you you may not have been a student here well you're not again you've graduated from here but but two thousand five we had Katrina\nAnd yeah that was a very interesting time on a lot of levels I mean and not only did we see the the fault line of race and class play out\nBut we ... that was an issue of do these people belong here because even when they referred to the folks that were impacted\nBy Katrina a particularly at the Ninth Ward a ... they they refer to them not as American citizens but as refugees\nAnd the question is these people who were born and raised here in families go back centuries because of you know the African American slavery and stuff again that's feeling of of\nOf not belonging it's a feeling of being in some in some ways I I Would just depicted as an alien origin\nBut even a part of of of of what we are we are about so yeah\nI mean I think actually want to ask this because this is something that's come up um a lot recently with regards to Boston is that a lot of people in the media have been a describing Boston as the most racist city [laughter] and I wonder what you thought about that well you know it's\nInteresting what once once the label gets [laughter] once you get a label it got to label and stuff so if you were here uh and in the seventies\nDuring the bussing a incident uh that's how it how it got it got its name you got to see some of the it was one of the ... last cities uh to to to deal with bussing sort of like it was one of the last\nUh teams here in Boston I think it was the uh baseball team to um\nTo have the people of color particularly black people on the team here so Boston Boston is quite interesting in many ways here um it it calls itself a city on the hill\nA so so it is it is it racist oh yeah traces and I think what's rape ... interesting about Boston is that\nIt will do everything to push back on that ah I I remember when Michael Che of a Saturday Night live he said I'm going to see\nUh the black his team\nPlay I don't know a team I Can't\nI'm trying to use in Atlanta right and a black a city and then play one of the yeah the most racist city thank you that's all right thank you thank you hear oh and what a ... [laughter] it was horrible\nAnd the interesting thing about it is that I like what Marty a mayor Marty washed walk Walsh does around this issue he said yeah we are and we are we're working on the air\nAs or ... you know it's it's not doing like my when I Do not we're not lynching black [laughter] not not not in that way so that you know we're so Boston um [noise] what is it called the spotlight team did a series or just last year as a matter of fact\nAnd it looked at race so our our meaning African American or a cumulative a cumulative wealth is eight dollars and when I read that in the in in the paper I kept saying oh let me write\nThem and said that they got the decimal point in the wrong place that\nHas to be wrong but it's eight dollars what ah what does that but she must've wealth meaning generationally what we can pass down and so so why don't we have accumulated wealth well two two and a half to two hundred and fifty years a free labor from ... we don't have anything to pass down\nUm didn't we then they said well when they\nStarted rebuilt the seaport area there's not any black business only businesses of color down there wow okay and so that's contemporary that's contemporary out of the house so when you look at\nBoard rooms news rooms or you don't you're black folks and not on people of color or not in high positions but then it yet you know this is a pub\nIn terms of education\nAnd a a kid from Dorchester rocks very matter pan has less of a chance of getting an end to this school then someone from someplace some other state here so there's no sort of um\n[noise] I Would say pipe line to to to help students of color get into these August institutions we have more like many other cities we have a sort of school a pipeline from school to jail that that you know yeah here\nAnd to this five hundred times you should listen to this one at least twice\n[laughter] I agree um [noise]\nSo uh we're talking about some heavy stuff uh before we went to the music break talking about racism in Boston um and also\nA lot of discrimination that has that has has base in is facing the altar beauty he'd community um especially with uh the third uh\nItem on the ballot that will be on November six six yeah yeah I remember now quest police vote yes on question three\nYeah so um\nYeah no it's important stuff uh\nYou know ... I I I just find I just find that troubling and I and I think I I well you know when I look at this era here I\nAm I'm hoping your generation and younger\nOr will it will come out and vote to understand that they're both really matters here mhm and stuff\nYeah not sit it out\nYeah I mean it is ... boggles me when you know I understand that sometimes people are like oh well you know there's not a good option I'm like well I'm not voting for none of them like you know abstaining doesn't mean that like\nThe ability to right they don't get it for like you don't get something done right in on his you know they're like oh well I guess we'll just have a frog right the right whatever and even if you don't like the person\nAt the top of the uh other ballot other other issues that go down the ballot yet that that this local politics that are profoundly unpack you yeah you know so that they'll that's important so that even if you can't vote for the the you know the top you know the top candidate on the ballot all those other issues are quite important\nThat's a huge thing like I found recently found out recently that\nLike out my roommate sister but my roommate sister [laughter] didn't didn't want to register because she's\nIt was I was registered in Florida uh to vote which is a swing state no yeah there's a there there was a big um pressure on me to stay registered in Florida\nEven though I live in Massachusetts I'm you know because like my presidential vote matters more buttoned down there than it would hear absolutely yeah yeah but at the same time there's all this local government and everything that we've been talking about like I live here now\nI've made a commitment to this community on to be living here and I want to you know the things we discussed be a part of it engage with it\nAnd so I'm registered here now because I Want to be able to vote on these really important issues that are affecting if they're not affected me directly affecting others\nAnd I ... I think what I'm very moved by I'm a ... and I think it was an April March for life he uh uh the the the kids that will students from Parkland who who who galvanized all\nA ... a ... you know I Would say kids from a from a I was the kindergarten through high school because they weren't college kids\nAre shamed us on the issue certainly of a gun of gun reform in this country but I but what but what I Am a move by is their tenacity and perseverance to keep the issue on you know in our consciousness\nAnd I think and and I I like to believe that Florida might move to being\nPurple [laughter] more than it is you know read\nIt's such a it's such an interesting\nUm political place having grown up in Miami especially I mean you have like a very red state um for most of the panhandle and most of Florida and then you get like this like southern tip that's kind of blue but then you have all these cars you have it's it's mostly immigrants that gets very\nOh yeah it's a Little Haiti down there you got little Cuba down there yeah\nYeah 'cause it's like you have like Florida as part of the south people when people find out you're from Miami they're like oh you know what living in the south is like\nAnd like [laughter] yeah yeah I'm In and so but at the same time a lot of the people who have immigrated to South Florida come from countries that have suffered at the hands of communist dictatorships and so they have a very very strong the or against any kind of socialist government\nUm because of like their associations with it but then also there's like a lot of racism that exists out for it I said it's like it's may have some social like liberal mess but there's a lot of stuff that still kind of is\nWell you know one of the things I've learned is that um our ... our our transport it you know what I mean they may they may uh started at a particular in a particular place but um you can transport your ... and and I'll give you an example so uh in the summer months I Will go to the town\nAnd so we will get you know immigrants you know from Jamaica and I'm using Jamaica I'm not denigrating me because we know Jamaica homophobic but so you so you would think that now have you had these immigrant workers in the summer who come\nAnd they know their NPT down you know but you know homophobia is what it is so we you know so we had to um\nGet with all of them and explain to them that well I Know you have tremendous disdain for homosexuality here I'm actually in our space in your working you know in this space a that is very ... that is that is a very gay or on a unapologetically so\nAnd stuff so I said to say that you know we transport those is ... no matter where we are\nYeah absolutely actually that was that's an interesting I'm saying that you just brought up which is would be the reverse of I Lived in a dorm in college that I had a very large clear community um and there is someone who decided to move to the dorm even though\nWere very\nA homophobic but they were aware of it and wanted to live in a community that was very different than that um but of course a lot of the\nUh the clear students who were in the dorm took issue with that and we're like you don't belong here on because this is\nYou know you don't accept us and like so we won't accept you and say I think that's often interesting question of like of the ... part of my ... and well not so much from because it's a dorm room for everyone coming from somewhere else but um yeah I I thought that was yeah well we have\nOur own sort of a infighting ... you know a ... within our um algae Beatty community here I mean nothing ... brings it more to the surface then to me a gay pride\nA a you know this is something that we all should be up in in in you know a rejoicing and happy about but because of the fault line of race and class and\nAnd some will say a gay male to Jimmy that that shapes and frames a Boston's pride you have now people who after many years of\nHave tried to have that conversation around um a more sort of a diverse you know parade\nHave gone off in their little ways here so we have the day parade we have the black you know pride and we have Latino you know all all of that so so yeah I mean ... the one thing I've learned particularly uh being quite active in the ... community that\nBecause because and it's dominated by white ethos that\nBecause you are oppressed due to heterosexual them doesn't mean you're not racist mhm if anything what it what is your outrageous debt you obey raft full white privilege because of this foreign\nOf heterosexual them I'm and I'm Talking you know so so the point is is that\nSay that um I Can't be a you know I ... as as an African American lesbian\nA minister I Can't just be fighting racism if I'm not also fighting you know a homophobia classes um uh you know anti Semitism Islamophobia it you know we it it it that's what that's the intersection of work that we have to\nHave to do in order to have what would king calls the ... community here and I think that in many ways we we we liked the idea of it uh but the actual live reality reality of it is something quite different so I think\nSo I use this term go way closer to describe\nCambridge and wanting a sanctuary city you know a kind of like everybody is welcome and I and I use the term go way closer to me ambivalence we want it but we don't [laughter] we we we want it in a sense of where it does not disrupt\nWhat we call the normal ... life\nAnd traditions of Cambridge uh we want it only in that way and and and stay peripherally\nYou know uh in ... and ... and in many ways to the life of Cambridge but once it might change the calculus in any way that that has been normalize a it raises issues so you see that\nMhm yeah so what ... what does that go way closer I call it go away meaning ambulance go way closer you know I'll go away closer yeah got it yeah yeah okay I got it yeah yeah no I mean it it it's true and I think a lot of it is because people", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cambridge", "day": "17"}
