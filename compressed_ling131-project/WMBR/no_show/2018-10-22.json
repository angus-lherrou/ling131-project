or information about upcoming concerts\nWas it on the shows Web site [noise]\nBut I mean is next introduced by\nCharlie coal has this is WNPR in Cambridge\nImagine me a dog moving in with a human I didn't know how it would work\nWho is in the White House that's that's the starting point that the tension is inhumane and violent and so is the immigration system\nWell when I was talking about letting immigrants action set the dynamic of the story rather than\nThe u._s. government announced this policy here some quotes from immigrants in response I was thinking about recent pieces of yours one that ran on rewire dot news and and why are the New York review of books daily that was headlined abolish ice beyond a slogan I failed at a very\nEncouraging story and just to the point that you've just made its reporting it doesn't change over into some other category of thing it's just reporting that has different actors at the center of it and it's really important we shift but I think our understanding of\nThe situation I Wonder if you could tell us a little bit about reporting that story on abolish ice and and what was coming through there\nIt's something that I'm thinking about more and more there's a clear undocumented poet named you'll see my re as he's been doing like a speaking tour called an ... joy\nAnd he talks a lot about how um we only want to show that tragedy that is\nWhat's happening to immigrants or how hard it is to be an immigrant with no real examples of how immigrants everyday don't just survive and thrive that have full and fulfilling lives and so that can't be at the center of all of the reporting I Do as an immigration reporter but it's something that I've been thinking about and it's been laying on me and so\nThis abolish ice piece changed forum and its reporting initially it was going to be sort of an overview\nYou'll riot didn't feel good and it it didn't reflect the interviews that I was doing was important to me that\nThe peas showed the resilience of immigrant communities of the movement to abolish ice is led by immigrants undocumented immigrants and specifically brown and black queer and trans immigrants they are on the front lines as they happen and many movements and it was important to me\nTo to highlight that and to showcase their resilience and the ways that they're fighting back and then also to sort of\nUplift the voices of people who\nDon't have a lot of options that are still fighting back that's why we showcased Jose cheek us who's a pastor and North Carolina has been in sanctuary for over a year\nOr less a private bills introduced in his name he can't remain in the U.S and he stuck in a church and people like ... who was deported under the Obama administration facing a ten year bar\nAnd she's coming up on nine years and she's terrified to come back to the United states because it's an even scarier place them and she was first reported so there's you know different immigrant communities have different realities and lived experiences and I want to highlight those as much as possible and make them the store and make them the center of the story\nAnd when you do the things fall out on such different lines Ben throughout much of reporting the people that you talk to\nDon't split their issue where their lives into you know the families versus felons the whole good versus bad ... framework that the state pushes the media too often echo they just that's not how they see things that all they have a different view of a\nYeah there there's certainly no like clear cut lines and the example of felons not families is really striking to me that something that President Obama said he said that you know we're we're deporting felons not families are we're that's who are targeting but you know if you are deported in the United states\nAnother family member and now you are Ellen in the eyes of the United states so innovation and is is not seen it complicated and like Haiti narratives don't serve anybody [noise]\nWe've been speaking with Tina Vasquez senior immigration reporter at ... dot news thank you so much for joining us this week on counter spin thank you for having me [noise]\nWhat is clear is that the Trump White house wants what it wants decades of carefully forged law and tradition be damned one of the things that want says the eradication of public expressions of dissent\nDonald Trump has said that protest against him and his friends should be illegal that those who engage in it should lose their jobs and or have violence visited upon them\nIf the White House can achieve that will they'll get as close to it as they can\nWhich brings us to the latest the national Park Service under interior secretary Ryan Zinke heat seeking to rewrite the rules on free speech and demonstrations on those public lands that are under federal jurisdiction in Washington DC\nThat would be the parks sidewalks and streets and the country's capital but I've seen some of the most significant public protests in us history\nWe're joined now for an understanding of this latest assault on the first amendment and how we pushed back by ... executive director of the partnership for civil justice filed and she joins us now by phone from Washington DC welcome back to counter spend\nMore overhead and he'll year to go out to be with you\nWell tell us about these proposed new rules from the national Park Service\nTrump Administration has put out the most substantial overhaul\nOf the regulations governing access to public lands in Washington DC for demonstrations we believe in the history of the Park Service we've never seen this\nMassive regulatory rewrite at one time and these are rules that have been forged incrementally over five decades of constitutional rights litigation one time and again\nThe park services and brought before a federal court where activists have had to fight to be able to demonstrate in Washington DC and these rules were put in place\nReally to guide the hand of the Park Service so that we would be able to exercise our free speech rights without them being able to take actions to disrupt the burden that exercise\nWhat they're trying to do is throw all of that out the window and just so that people have an understanding of the scope of this we're talking about\nAll of the most sort of iconic locations when you think about the history of protests in the United states we're talking about the national mall the Lincoln Memorial the White House sidewalk Lafayette Park the Washington Monument grounds the sidewalks up and down Pennsylvania Avenue including in front of the Trump Hotel [noise]\nWhat they have proposed it has more than fourteen points rulemaking but just to highlight some of the key provisions that are so damaging\nThey have put out a proposal that we've called the protests tax where they're asking the public for they had asked for comment on whether or not people that want to demonstrate on these public lands in Washington DC should be charged for doing so and those charges could include anything from\nThe barricades and fencing that are set up at the discretion of the police so you know they're going to Penn un in charge you for it\nThat could include the salaries and over time of park\nDemonstrators demonstration organizers for claimed harm to the grass\nThat people stood upon an assembly to demonstrate these charges could\nMount in the not just the thousands but tens of thousands and in fact the hundreds of thousands of dollars so we're there to succeed it would make demonstrations just you know Bradley expensive and with threatened to bankrupt grassroots organizations and that's just one of the proposals\nWell it sounds like there's no reason to pretend that it's really about the actual cost I mean it seems it seems very clear that it's aimed at actually making it difficult or hey impossible to engage in public protest\nI don't think that anyone can possibly think this is simply and and the ministry of matter I mean this is the Trump Administration\nWith its rhetoric against demonstrators in hostility to the first amendment and towards protests taking that rhetoric and turning it into concrete plans to stifle and crush demonstrations in the nation's capital they have in this proposal a second measure\nBy which they would be able to charge demonstrators for the ability to demonstrate they want to take\nDemonstrations and give officials discretion to go through people's programs and asserts that there are what they call a special event elements inside a program which as best as we can tell could mean you know anything from\nAn exhibit like the iconic AIDS quilt exhibit because it is not literally people speaking right to musical performances at a demonstration which you know all demonstrations routinely have cultural and musical performances ... think about even the Nineteen sixty three\nMarch on Washington in a data was their Joan Baez\nIn ... in a few songs so hope you enjoy the rest of my\n[noise]\n\nBaby and you can't have a\nDay\nTo day basis they look\n\n\nI I [laughter]\n\n\n\nShare your\nPaper and\nAnd your
