you do I am a cage you beat today knee your cave gee the trainee indeed I I like allowed to get that information out like I'm a Chinese yeah for sure [laughter] now now it's my understanding that the KGB\n... thing or that's what they want you to think [laughter] well I'm sure you'll pass the test would yeah I ... yes a plus\nI let you talk about it so much just because it's like you don't do not know anything or you're working up to it where where are you in\nYour trained they just on this American media they are they really are you you're free\nYeah I'm pretty happy mind survey that a baby

are hurting into our\n... our show yeah yeah yeah I had I got through I'm different teams here right now no no no we're rooting for the red Sox the views that opinion [laughter] discussing this so does that represent I like the the technology rocket ration WMD are are necessarily anybody else [laughter]\nThey certainly do represent a me so I have always been that great disappointment and now a question\nFor you to Demitri so you're you're trainee ethic KGB it's not an easy life I\nWhat's the cause for the call what what's the cause doing that a modern a Russian intelligence operation is already doing\nOh well the causes and also we're all about you know togetherness and Johnny forgetting to begin\nTo help people [noise] churning together in a big endeavor to help people now that that was about ... and and personal introspection anyway to me like the KGB might have softened up a little bit in the past\nCouple of decades that would just be allies this call like assassination stuff you know feeling like spy secrets and intelligent things it wasn't cutting it anymore you know now we're all about helping people choose their full potential\nOh are you in like renaming like changing with the acronym ... cool guy brigade I think really it's got a lot of like to I think my ...\nThese would be interested in this a proposition they'll pass it along awesome can I can I submit estimates more apt\nTo ask my space would be interested in your book Russia\nHas had a cat with yeah that seems like the most effective way for the KGB to re brand [laughter]\nExcellent ah okay so

the KGB guys keep doing a good way of doing right\nThe one and only I Am a native to Tony in and I'm the son of immigrants that I've got a a mother who was from New Zealand and a father who was from

have you\nHeard of a man\nCreation of control full control just straight out of control over\nThe a judiciary along with the executive and legislative branches in consolidating a one party state at least for a while I suspect that the the uh the mid term elections might\nDo something to a a in a sense disrupt some of the control over the house but I'm I'm\nSad to say dubious about a ... breaking control over the Senate which is the confirmation weapon right then also\nThe Democrats take the house that they will impeach him at least put them on the defensive and that way and help build you know doing that can help build the kind of political environment\nAs we go to our twenty twenty or does ... that's going to be the other piece that's there and it's it's interesting to see that the Republicans already worried about it or is I'm a you know the constitution does not limit the membership to the Supreme Court to nine judges\nAre back in ancient history FDR tried to pack the court to reinforce his progressive changes who's locked by expanding the coral exactly and so this is something that I think we need to begin thinking about and talking about we need to be imaginative\nOr you know there there you know like we are committed to I'm a country of laws are also recognizing that you know sometimes the laws with those have the power to impose it say it is a but you know to really be pushing back with her democratic imaginations\nNow these are domestic issues these are also very much issues that affect everywhere in the world um what it it's the\nThe line about the U.S economy or the U.S economy gets a cold the rest of the world gets the flu now it it may go the other ways as well to say the least and a flu around the world can cause pneumonia here of\nThese are these are very very dangerous\nTimes and you have had enormous contact with folks around the world both in person going there and visiting or communicating you know over the amazing communication systems that we now have 'em\nAnd yet I I often feel as though when I'm reading the even very good analytical outlets here in the United states we're not we're not really getting a\nYeah on around the world and I was wondering if you had some thoughts about a couple of the places that you've been spending quite a bit of time on\nWell yeah I was I was in in Brussels or for a counter NATO summit uh events and you lose track of the time I guess was in the late spring a and a Trump a Trump came uh yeah he was greeted by Trump not welcome a demonstration\n'em and\nYou know this this is the increasing isolation of the United states and we need to understand you're talking about catching the flue\nOr you know this is this is a government which in in so many ways is out of control\nOr is arrogance in his brutality or have alienated so much of the rest of the world even as you do have the reality [noise] excuse me a rising nationalism authoritarianism or you know China or Russia or Eastern Europe so you know a sense the planet as a whole is sick right now [noise]\nUm but one of these that we see a receipt with say the withdrawal from uh the uh Iran agreement actually can't withdraws violation of the agreement [noise]\nUm [noise] the United states is increasingly isolated me here is the European Union is actually a with Britain and Russia are looking to create alternative\nA financial means to allow a country's in governments and the companies to circumvent the U.S sanctions I\nMean this is this is unique we have a situation where Trump has said that the European Union is a ... well I mean they take that seriously or they're planning accordingly\nOr and you know if you pursue that kind of isolation a year under cutting your economy uh you're under cutting your security the one that's one of the analyses here is that if the\nAnd in in terms of the United states being the world's dominant currency\nOnce you lose that that position with the dominant currency it means a lot of the artificial the subsidies if you're a condom E R last so what does that mean for our pensions what does that mean for our kids and grandkids education in future I mean is is very very a real\nUm you know you have the situation\nOr in to talk about fertility I'm On the one hand in in ... well I mean one hadn't have you got the you know the trade wars right so the other piece here is is Trump has led us into a trade war with China\nAre and that's the kind of thing that could conceivably leads to another Great Depression or you know so it's it's this or arrogant belief that we can dominate control whatever we say goes and it doesn't doesn't work that way\nWell these are of course I'm a crucial issues for the the themes that are going to be discussed that at this conference because the whole idea of\nOf of a campaign for peace disarm them in a common security is not simply about uh the\nThe question of of nuclear weapons war et cetera it's very much about a globalized economy and what the impact of of a crisis is we're talking with Joe ... from the campaign for peace disarmament and common security\nAnd a Joe ... you just mentioned the Iran situation that's happening you know if it goes according to the schedule that Trump and his his folks are put in motion that's the next month\nIn November fourth the sanctions right before the election uh yeah a brilliant man is one one one more a great great success one more way in which he's filled his his commitment or you know if\nAnd the foundation of us Saudi relations right\nAnd at the moment those are increasingly shaky I'm you know drop his trumpet saying well we can't really break relations with the Saudi Arabia they buy a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of of us weapons to them it's not quite quite that large when you've got the the the deep alliance between\nA Christian or a and M. B. S. the crown prince there so in in a sense this crisis is really a challenging even further the legitimacy of Trump\nOr and compounds the the the uh um\nUh coming confrontation with\nWith Iran and and please correct me if I'm wrong but there is no ambassador of the United states and Saudi Arabia and this is all back channel private communication within the administration's\nRight I Know that that you know it's it's it's it's top top all the same time and again just looking at the madness at all or\nWhile Iran is fully implemented a its commitments under the uh under under the mass yeah a nationalist Atomic Energy association U.S intelligence all say there's\nA meanwhile a Trump is celebrating his love letters from Kim ... or you can say Joan er and\nI uh [noise] you know these these negotiations are are are going\nTo going anywhere they're very very slow and and I think we have to raise questions here I mean that the north Koreans are rightly or calling for a sequel process or they're demanding movement toward um ah ending the ending the Korean War\nOr and or the United states is reluctant to to make that move and and so uh it's it's much more of a stasis situation than than they want us to believe\nYeah the Korea and\nOne of the uh common um statements in in the American media is that both\nOr the south Korean and Japanese uh populations and media are actually optimistic about the possibilities of some forms of resolution\nThey credit in some cases they credit crunch Trump for this [laughter] um what are your thoughts about that and uh are you a ... as you just said what you seem to be saying is vastly less\nMovement than ... than noise\nSo so I was a program yesterday and and one of the speakers was a woman named ... a young lady who was a Korean American and I've been working for for a piece and reunification and Korea for quite quite some time\nOr the way I think the um Korean American and allied of figures in in in Korea see it\nOr is that there is a very narrow window of opportunity between now and twenty twenty\nOf a CD for us and uh it's it's a it's or a new acquisition is a better way of putting it uh but it's a it's a fantastic collection of vision shared on Folkways Records and that includes\nPeople like Dylan and John Mellencamp and Springsteen of course and little Richard with fish bones [laughter] ah just just wonderful artist Taj Mahal a Sweet Honey in the rock\nSo ah and of course Pete Seeger are doing this land is your land with a a cast of dozens of others amazing uh other amazing artist so uh\nBut I I was remembering you know the impact of of music and culture or in in in the sixties anti war movement the civil rights movement a and I'm a you know what is going back to both you know the the music you open the set with\nAnd in our conversation about uh you know the structural change here and resistance you know just to appreciate the role of art or in in keeping vision alive keep hope alive a defining reality changing consciousness\nAnd I'm I'm not an authority or on a a on Eastern Europe or during the um the period of of the Soviet occupation of Soviet occupations are but I think there are lessons to learn there\nIn terms of how uh people are found their way kept their their vision kept their spirits alive\nOr and and in the end in in the most unexpected ways or the dictatorship sell\nUh so I I think I think we we we need to be honoring a and supporting and encouraging ah this this this part of our of our of our society and the reality is that the resistance takes place across just a very very broad spectrum of of a society and culture\nOr so you know we're talking about the responsibility of intellectuals in academia\nOr we're talking about the responsibility of progressive a spiritual leaders like a rubber Barbara and others are you know we're we're talking about the need for a progressive political organizing and what you're doing your local community or the whole range\nI think one of the most interesting um pieces of this past week uh for me in a you know a week that has been traumatic in so many ways a is watching the the ... almost bizarre I'm conflict around\nWith some of her former fans who included folks on the far right saying how could she betray us in this way\nUh and and yet this is the power both of music and in the United states and celebrity so it's this this ... it it is a real flash point to say the least I mean we saw what happened with the Dixie Chicks [noise]\nWe uh we have seen what happens when people make a present stand for a position that are somehow a challenge as the ideology of portions of their fan base and it's\nThese are these are very very loud public\nConversations about the imperative of standing\nAnd now I Love it that uh they just released it was just released a letter to ... new book of poetry or with you know the the the ... are focusing on is you know uh I I'm not Cain west in fact he is and who he is and and you know one of the things that have been been interesting\nIs is to see that you know the African American community is not rally around came west right and you know I mean there's a long history of people are having a soldier sold off I'll tell a story just 'cause this is from ancient history but I think it's instructive um\n[noise] you know John voices now you know long been one of the worst of the hard right winger is right I can remember I can remember in the summer of Nineteen Seventy two\nAre in Arizona uh my wife was on the Democratic state committee which was sort of exercising futility or and they were having a small rally or rally they thought a from a governance the presidential campaign\nAnd it's like in a church and there's hardly anybody there and the guest speaker believe it or not it was John fleet\nOr and voice came and he\nUh some some people will remember the film coming home or if you want to lay off his our cultural history you go back and look at it\nYou know Jane Fonda on them and and void and it's it's about the other is returning Bruce turn that I Can't remember if you'd like he played her husband but what I remember what our members is closing scene he's he's talking to an audience in a high school auditorium\nOr about the war and he breaks down crying we had already seen that are in in Arizona He was simply replaying it\nUm and you know in here you get then goes off and just just to the hard right now so in a lot of people sell their souls a small folks and as the U.S who did the same [noise]\nUh but uh you know he's coming back to\nUh all of us have to do at a particular editors of ram parts oh I I I uh yes yes yes [laughter] ah we all have to push as we can we do we do we're speaking with Joe Gerson here on radio interview my name is mark stern Joe is a long\nTime activist a and international representative for various groups the American friends service committee and now the campaign for peace disarmament and common security\nAnd Joe as you talked about the isolation of the United states that this is\nUm this is something that that's really disturbing you and and really frightening in many ways uh I was wondering if you could expand on that in relation to an environment as\nAs say in Europe where you have written about to leave the EU and says well and so this is part of a ... and you have the rise of neo fascist movements throughout Eastern Europe authoritarianism and\nWhen you see this kind of a structure recon figuring what grows through your head you somebody to study this for a very long time so I guess are\nTwo things come to mind immediately um\nOne is that uh you know if I was listening on the radio and the way over here and a Sears\nA Sears, Roebuck is about to collapse\nOr and and you know which is you know all all systems\nUm have entropy\nOr and um and and needs to be revitalized refreshed if they're if they're to endure so to appreciate that we're now three and a half generations past the end of the second World War\nThree and a half generations past the\nCreation of the um [noise]\nA US led international system a and a ... as the same time you've had a through the corruption of the money primarily but also militarism are you know the the um a corruption of the American political system which has contributed to to uh the the uh\nA few of the writing of of the system as a whole [noise]\nUh the second is a quote from William Faulkner that I I I all I repeat frequently which is the past isn't dead it isn't even pay isn't even pass and\nSo to appreciate that while this difficult for many of us to see some of these forces\nAre like the depths of American racism\nOr the um power of I'm a conservative nationalist a Christianity or as a as a force ah [noise] the uh\nThe values that that had it\nGovernments in the mid in the in in in the inner war period you know kind of coming after the collapse of the aisle stronger empire these these things are still alive and had room to grow the corruption is and the other thing just to\nYou know we we we all focus so much on on Trump and the and the crisis here uh the collapse of Germany and and the rest but we need to go back I think to Bush's war on Iraq\nOr to these things didn't happen by accident and this was a absolutely stupid brutal act or that uh ultimately accelerated the collapse of\nThe system what about the collapse of the system was intentional not the extent of it but when Bush and Cheney and their ...\nThe only thing we have to you\nYou\nDoes not matter what\nYou're doing them by\n... by the ...\nLike all red\nBerries John monitor\nYour dogs the\n\nWell God or ... or\n... W. M. B. R. Cambridge more black radio\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n... ... s\nFor\n\nOn there [laughter]\n\n\n\n\nHello I'm welcome to another week or two broke means I'm I'm Lucy and uh we have a guest with us this week\nI this is Jesse Clarke I Am a PHD candidate at MIT and political science\nYeah so how has your weeks gone\nI\nWork and he says buddy yeah yeah\nYeah how 'bout you once ... once in a pretty good just a starting up my research my dissertation and a following some politics right now which is pretty exciting\nYeah so let's talk about politics um\nSo we know that this election is coming up very soon um and we know that you also do a lot of research um with election so tell us what do you do and like tell us about elections\nPerfect or so in general I I Do research in how the elections are actually run from\nThe machines are using a little bit on election security and um voter confidence so are people\nAre people thinking that their ballots are counted as they intended because you see a lot of um a lot of people even is ration saying things about voter fraud and there's some public opinion questions there so I I tend to study those as well and just how the elections are going to\nTurn out as an outcome so yeah\nUm so what do you think about like the twenty sixteen oh I mean sorry the current elections the twenty Eighteen elections um how is voter confidence looking like this year ... going into the mid term elections\nSo the Russia Russia thing I'm with\nBreaking are trying to break into the elections and the fake news part so I Do I don't really touch the fake news as much that that's a big issue but in terms of what we're seeing about people thinking about people breaking into voting machines and electro election infrastructure\nThere doesn't seem to be any big um push back against that right now people seem to be fairly confident from what I understand going into the election\nUm but that that also breaks along party lines pretty heavily if you if you support the president the elections ready fine if you're more on the liberal side then oh no the Russians are\nThere they can break and so it it really depends on where you lean in party right now\nYeah that's really true\nRoom in your work focuses on also on gerrymandering\nYeah so I Do I Do a little work in redistricting and gerrymandering so essentially\nTrying to see how\nGerrymandering has impacted the makeup of Congress and we do the research group I'm a part of um started with my undergrad thesis was trying to simulate every possible redistricting\nPossible here's what we have now\nWhat's what's the makeup comparison and it's been a hot topic in political science for about Twenty years and political science has been aired on the side of oh no it hasn't really done much\nBut we're actually showing it it costs up to twenty seats for the Democrats right now it's not everything it's not every majority of the Republicans have had but it's definitely helped them a significantly\nI see and so um what is that they make the district gerrymandered you know like what what isn't characteristics of a dream and her district\nSo the first thing people like to look at it shaped 'em and shape\nIt it's a good indicator but it's not great um some of the most gerrymandered district in the country are actually in Columbus the around Columbus ohio and those are almost perfect squares a lot of them so it's an interaction of the shape but also the shape compared to\nThe people that are living in that shape people tend to forget about that you see like the vox articles like oh the twelve most gerrymandered places\nIn the country and there are all these crazy shapes some sometimes those are really badly gerrymandered sometimes that's just natural how the districts wash out with the way populations underlying\nSo you can actually look at a district as a single district it's that the makeup of the state is how we take a look at it because if you change you can't ever just gerrymander one district ... drawing one district you've limited the possibilities for the other districts around it\nSo okay I see and so\nAre there certain ways certain policies one can enact in order to\nPrevent you know\nFrom dream entering districts in the future so that's one that we've been able to identify so far and you sort of independent commissions so Arizona does this fairly well um and there's a few other states that have\nBreak the tie and a lot of what they'll do is\nThey won't eliminate gerrymandering because I Would actually argue you really can't eliminate some sort of gerrymandering because people sort themselves into cities Democrats live in cities Republicans live in the countryside that's just natural sorting\nA bullet they'll do is they'll control and so in Arizona you have I Believe it's five districts are seven but it would break sound with an equal number of Republican gerrymandered districts with democratic gerrymandered districts and in a district that can flip it just kind of random draw who wins that district\nYou know I've looked at it and I think um\n[noise] I think he did fit where I was living I I Would um I think it's a very I mean ... politicians get a bad rap but in some of them some of them of earned it to be honest\nBut public service is a very important thing and I'm stepping up and taking care of your community is also a very important thing in my mind and sometimes you get sucked into the environment and that's where politicians get a bad rap but I think especially the local level those\nThose officers are very very important and\nMy the vice I was given actually had two U.S senators telling me this way tc just move around because they're on different political parties was do you want to get involved in stuff you wanna get involved in politics you want to get involved in town government local government Gigi went on for president someday you show up\nThere they're just looking for the people to show up especially when you're in our demographic below thirty like if you show up to a Massachusetts dams or Massachusetts Republicans at mass GOP event you're the youngest person there everyone wants to talk to you you're the celebrity I guarantee you if you went to an event\nUm especially in an off year election year gets a little more exciting but especially in off year you shopped an event like hey I Want to do some work I Want to get involved somebody's gonna grab you\nSome you will Vilsack un and that's that's how you know happens you just show up\nWanting to work so see I think when when the career career positions right I'll I'll show up\nThat's exciting [laughter] yeah we might show up to you know we'd be like\nGet the campaign experience yeah that's a possibility\nSo um if\nSo running for office herself as a possibility but in the meantime like what are your more concrete plans more concrete plans to dissertation topic right now okay right right my book a book now it'll be hopefully on the causes and consequences of\nI'm voting reform like how people got suffrage will probably have some work on women's suffrage\nUm and then what those voting reforms have done to me the tour make up through the United states\nSo that's that's the concrete goals right now I'm I'm In my third year so the possibilities are endless but nice I'll I'll be picking very soon\nYeah um do you have like very strong feelings about like like younger people voting and like things like that\n[noise]\nYeah they need to go vote [laughter] I I think young people have the most or\nThere's most impacted by a lot of these decisions because you make a subtle change to a tax plan it might it might not impacting on forty years but we're the ones that it's impacting 'cause when we're forty we're about to retire or when in forty years from now we're about to retire\nUm so yes people people need to go vote people need to get informed and that's especially important at the younger ages um\nBecause I mean let's let's face it voting in college kind of confusing like where especially I might teach students are around the world there from I think there's one from every state at least um there's all these different requirements for voting um\nAnd if if anybody any at MIT student has any questions but I feel free to email me of course\nActually vote and that's if those deadlines haven't hit yet there they will be soon so I Would encourage everyone to go at least get an absentee ballot you don't have to send it back in if you're like oh this is terrifying but look at the candidates look up the issues it's daunting but you do it a couple of times and you always do it it just becomes easy\nLike riding a bike now [laughter] yeah\nYeah it's definitely like really cool to see someone like you know doing things are really passionate about you know that's why we enjoy like having your over ... you\nKnow that right yeah is there something that you're excited about you know they're coming here we're like coming weeks\nUm I mean so it's election season so it it's it's very exciting time we have some pretty strong predictions right now about how things are going to turn out and it'll be interesting if that actually comes out of because we're looking at a democratic takeover of the house right that seems to be an pending\nThat being said people need to go vote [laughter]\nRegardless of what side you're on but people need to go vote 'em and then I don't think there'll be a democratic takeover of the sentence that that would need a huge huge wave I I'm not holding my breath for that but I think the house will slip and then that will create very exciting atmosphere in DC\nI'm especially when you have a Democratic House and then a very Republican president\nWho to house does not like very much at that point so that that's that's pretty exciting from my a political entertainment and political science background [laughter]\nWell we're excited to see what'll happen um most of the house ways and the Senate less than a month away after we cast their ballots are interesting story so I think that we're both going to vote for like not in the state of Massachusetts\nI'll be voting in one of the Senate races I'm not in Massachusetts I'm from Missouri I'm you might notice Claire McCaskill is up for reelection the jury and I'm not quite sure how that's going to turn out that's\nAn exciting right I I Do\nThis for a living and I don't know [laughter] oh well thank you so much for coming on air with us we're really really happy that you talk to us and that you let us interview you\nGuys coming over\n\n\nEverybody thinks we're listening you know that was Jesse\nA um PHD student um you guys had fun listening to our conversation with them you know now we're going to play some music for 'em and\nWere you [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nA ha ha ha ha\n\n\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\n\nWe we register people in all the states so we register people\nDrivers licenses so we can't register a lot of the MIT students because they're not from Massachusetts but they feel connected here like to go to school here um and it's way easier for them to vote because they can just walked across keepers just like trying to mail and find stamps and stuff so we also register people out of state so a lot of those deadlines have passed by now because\nRegistration deadlines vary by state and what you have to do and where you have to mail it um it's actually really complicated to coordinate because there are so many different places to register people and they all have different deadlines and they all have different rules so we use a tool called turbo vote which is something to MIT\nPays for and it'll register you in any state it'll take you to that state's page will fill out the forum and it'll\nUsually email it to you I'm so that you can print it and it'll give you posted for it so I might see pays for that postage and as long as people thought out and print it and then pop it in a mailbox we can get people registered in their home state as well so it's up to them to decide where they want to vote\nThat's so amazing I didn't realize that terrible they'll vote help people with um people from other states\nYeah TurboTax MIT dot EDU it's free for MIT community everybody should use it\nWow I'm so what strategies are you thinking about using to like turn out the vote in November\nOh man we been talking to MIT students we try to assess what are some of the barriers why\nWhy are people not voting um so we talked to a bunch of people about it I think one of the big problems that we see is that MIT students have\nOr maybe the opposite problem as a lot of people in the country where they won't take a position on something if they don't feel like they're an expert in the topic so you see a lot of people um I think generally people would rather like\nHave an opinion without a lot of facts to back it up which was like I don't know it's still a valid way of voting like you know however you want\n'em but MIT students in particular I think\nThey don't know how to get from where they are to knowing enough to feel comfortable voting and they'd rather not express an opinion\nI think it comes from a good place like it comes from a place of I don't want to exercise the power that I have voting over other people and I don't really know what I'm voting for but I think it gets taken to an extreme where\nUh people think that the only valid reason to vote is if you are an expert which nobody nobody's like an expert in every single policy on the ballot but\nWe all live in this country and we all live in our different communities and like we have the right to express what we think so one of our strategy is to get back to your question is ah hosting events that make people feel comfortable\nA learning how to choose what to vote for on the ballot so we're hosting an event\nI'm exactly a week before the election was has on November six so a week before then we're hosting an event called how to vote a tentative name where we're gonna\nGoes through at least for the Massachusetts ballot uh everyone on the ballot we're going to talk about them probably\nWhatever's on that platform I'm as our team has a nonpartisan team just like here's what's on the ballot here's what these\nInitiatives means and we're bringing in all of the hardest and organizations on campus to kind of set up booths in the room and so we're going to go through the whole Massachusetts ballot and then let the students who come mingle with the different partisan organizations and like talk to people about what the different groups representing um and and\nUse that to kind of inform their opinions are also going to tell them about different resources that they can use to\nFigure out what they want to do for example on the Boston Globe and like newspapers usually will do endorsements of candidates you can look for issue groups that you care about see if they endorse any of the candidates that are on the ballot you can go to the candidates website and look at their platform maybe look at some of the speeches that they've given it doesn't it can take\nPeople want to put into it but I Do believe that that everybody here has the right to express their voice and to ... to vote for people that they think will represent them I think it's very important so I Do hope that the MIT community will will feel valuable enough that they can contribute to this election yeah\nI think that that's a really good thing to do all I've seen a lot of like MIT vote events I live in Britain called her yeah Sarah and then like I just see all these events having all the time for like voter registration and then I see like the voter registration people at\nOther non MIT vote related events and I know I just think that it's really really amazing that you know we're turning out the vote at MIT\nYeah what are you guys think about um 'cause you guys are a year younger than me what did you think coming into MIT about voting like where are you registered but that process been like for you guys\nYeah I think before coming to my T I was already registered to vote in California\nHave you been voting has it been easy yeah I'm voting in California isn't too bad I just I remember filling out a forum online last semester to again my ballot mailed here and I was able to vote in the primaries for this there's ...\n... yeah that must not have been your experience to as Washington yeah I mean voter voter registration an absentee ballot rules totally vary by states I'm so Washington at least most people\nAlmost all of them actually it's either most are like it's required I think my parents told me it was required\nUm that everybody male so people don't usually go to polling places everyone will get their ballot mailed they'll have a few weeks to kind of ... over it like research things market and then mail it back in 'em and they've recently instituted like free postage so I get my ballot and I can just drop it back I don't need to like buy stamps and stuff which actually ends up being a big ...\nAffected um it's been easy to vote in Washington but Washington is one of the states that has maybe and probably California's well\nRules to make it pretty easy to vote on other states have tougher idealized or at least in Texas we've had issues trying to register people because protects us\nUm at least trying to register online you have to register and like find a reason for why you want an absentee ballot and then you have to apply to get an absentee ballot and like basically prove that you're not in the state um and you need to know that as well so out of the the Texas students that are here having a hard time\nThat's I think than the one state but it's been tricky but I it totally very five states I mean it's good to hear that you guys were able to register and vote okay\nUm I the last time I voted within the twenty sixteen election and I really want to vote and the twenty Eighteen election because there is a Democrat up for reelection on for a Missouri's Senate seat\nAnd um it's just a really big struggle um\nMissouri has a pretty nasty voter id law and um I don't I'm not quite sure what the what the necessary like for seniors get an absentee ballot is because I don't even know where to request his absentee ballot\nOh really yeah I looked on the website and it told me to go email this one email address and asked for a person like email my\nFor nail in life formed sue ... and then I just got really confusing that I gave up\nNo no no I'm afraid of my heart\nReally will I'm pretty sure that I already has some deadline but I'll go do some more research tonight because I really want to vote at\nThe absentee ballot deadline hasn't passed yet that seems early but my\nA whole that seed stories like that just like\nLike break my heart especially with young people like young people don't vote I'm just looking at a very sad part is that I saw last night on MIT confessions\nUm where someone basically for those where you don't know MIT confessions as a Facebook page where people can post anonymously um there's a lot of a really bad political dialogue going on there but someone posted a really long posts last night\nAbout why people shouldn't vote I'm basically saying like funding doesn't matter like your one vote one change anything um it's hard to mobilize groups of people are like it's likely that whatever you do um won't change anything and you should just like stay home and it broke my heart because so many young people think that they think\nThey think they're voting of some sort of game that you have to play and that the winters are the ones who like if you're at the most influence that like you should only vote if you will personally change anything but that's totally their own perspective like voting\nVoting as you like expressing your opinion on how you want to be governed it's like so fundamental to the Democratic process and and also the reality is that politicians\nDon't care about non voting populations it makes sense they need to spend their time appealing to the population that elect them\nTheir constituency um the constituency includes us too but if we don't vote they look at the numbers young people aren't voting there's really no need to cater to\nYoung people there's no need to talk about affordable housing for us um there's no need to talk about grocery stores are like transportation that affects the MIT community in particular in Cambridge\nSee it's a national\nSeven thousand high school students drop out every school day\nIt doesn't make sense to us either we can't keep students in school does it look stepped out of work and take the first step brought to you by the U.S army in the ad council\n\n[noise] good [noise]\n\nYeah that was certainly the child\nDraw\nThe money for\nA long\nTime in the show\n[noise]\nMm [noise]\nOn one for\nThing that day on Saturday\n[noise]\nDa da\nNa na na na\nNa\nA\n\nGood afternoon listeners you're tuned into WNPR Cambridge this is eighty eight point want to thank you for tuning into base case proving you can like music from any ... and at the natural number I'm Julia and once again I'm your host for today\nThank you for listening to our show the track you just heard was known him number one by Elliott Smith off of Roman candle\nExcept we've got a check for you by the Alabama Shakes this is off of sound the color guess who\nUm um [noise]\n\n[noise] do do do do do do do do\nDo do do do do do it but the independence there was this guy to prove that it can be made him get to do anything to do to go\nTake the\nThe the\nThat you have\nTo prove that they\nNeed to be able to pay\nPer se and don't get into their independence\n\nCan be tricky to to\nGo down and then and then you\nHave to be continued to enter into it\nAnd [laughter]\n\nYou\n\nNo\n[laughter]\n[noise] ... and the game and\nChurch [laughter] ... [laughter]\nAnd ... and ... and ... and he [noise]\n\nHe can turn around and Taiwan and China and\nI Wish I had a right to ah [noise]\n[noise] Mm [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUh [noise]\n\nJust listen to attract by just tell me that was not the time next step we have a track by one of my favorite artists off of one of my favorite album this is from voting they're twenty two million now if you listen to the show before I'm sure you've heard me go off on this album is amazing grade whatever whatever the production is so good there's only so much\n\n\nOh no\n\nOh no I'm\nI\nCouldn't get\nFree to do\nJust he can't\nNo no\nMa ... um [noise]\nHe\nJust\nWrong way around [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] you just listened to I'm friday bye Frankie Cosmos off of the vessel that's a new album that they just released um let me see what actually I Know it was this year\nIt was start of August I actually had the chance to see them live fairly recently and it was really amazing uh honestly it was such a good concert or there was this really great point where it got to the um\n[noise] the the problem and I stress of for the cause most says you know like I'm\nI haven't had a lot of stage fright lately like when performing says towards that going on for so long so let's do something fun so at the start of one song she passes this Rubik's Cube to someone in the audience into like mix it up really well just jumble it all up\nAnd then it started the next song [noise] excuse me started the next song she sang she sang diverse and the course like this tag therapy throughout the whole thing\nAnd then she went to the side of the stage and was solving this Rubik's Cube as she had all the other band members of the cosmos and then all the openers that played for her all take turns singing this one chorus\n'em like they would play like a few parts of the instrumental and then someone would come in and they would trade places and saying it was really fun\nUm especially at the un seeing her ...\nI Know I'm really thinking this album vessel is very good so a lot of really nice little vignettes I think\nUh the songs are pretty short if you just listen to on friday there was less than two minutes or so that's a really interesting stuff on that album I Would recommend checking out vessel actually play another track of that later today a but it is now time for something which I haven't done in quite a while on this show this is the Radiohead song of the day um\nMakes me think of that ... that are lovely a former general manager Caitlin made for me it was very kind of her and we miss her very much\nUm [noise] so yeah if for those of you don't know I used to do this thing where I Would I Would just put Radiohead on the track list for the day and\nThen this joke came out of it where it was like oh like I only play radio ... that was like no that's not true but actually like that's kinda funny so what if we did it every show so now I Try to pick one song for every for every show from the radio disc RV I knew a ton of your folks have been releasing some sort of stuff for the\nUs is ... a soundtrack so that's also some interesting stuff that might get played on the show I in the next couple of weeks I'm sure that movie's coming out probably fairly students horror movie season\nI'm In any case let me not distracts you further from the Radiohead song of the day I don't want to disappoint so this is drinks all falling into place\n[noise] [noise]\nMm [noise]\n\n\nDa da da da da\nBut they look down on the show\nAnd Adam\n... or\n\n...\nNa na na na\n\nNa na na\nNa na na na\nNa na na\nNa ...\n\n\n\n\nThen we\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] ...\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n...\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nOoh\n[noise]\n\n...\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nYou just listen to people for recording I was thinking about the ... hot Harris that was ... it is I clues on the yes it is I could recommend that if you haven't heard of ...\nFor the public so make sure to give ... to listen it's I've I've really enjoyed it lately\nUm sounds that we played earlier we played a Pearl ... off of her new album be the cowboys she's actually playing in Boston this weekend so I Will let you know how that concert goes and then he played twelve steps by Japanese Breakfast off of soft sounds from another planet\nOur next according for you today is ... uh this is the same fight off of identities are changeable he's a really really impressive ... it's like really really impressive I'm actually the the jazz ensemble that I'm In actually had the opportunity to play with him last semester\nAnd we will be doing so again this year so more information to come if you're interested in jazz just do some digging for some MIT jazz and I'm sure you'll find something good\nThis is the same fight lots of really interesting things going on here um\n[laughter] I'll just leave you too because I really can't explain so let's see what you think\nOf going from the Upper East side\nOne weekend to going to Harlem on it actually just depending on what I wanted to do was horrible for\nDifferent lifestyle and I think that you know at least my I'm African American origin sure a lot of the same interests and a lot of the same [noise] Joyce [noise]\nAt least I think that's really kind of [noise]\nWay they dress the way they look really I mean think about it becomes almost impossible to tell bars in\nFor making part of the ... like American foreign policy which is which is where the news here and it was almost like the\nFantasy speak Spanish and going back to who was involved with\nUnderstood that I read you know you know one first\nBoys took over that so\nCompelled to listen to choose the jails in in the wonder of friends here in WNPR in Cambridge and that's the thing I should be able to do without any trouble at all crime is it will be worth your while I should make promises it may or may not be worth your while not okay that's pretty creative God I Can't use good sentence structure now you know\n[noise]\nHello WNPR listeners I'm I'm Amy and I'm here with Cory Romanoff he's a freshman here at MIT and Corey is originally from Phoenix, Arizona and I'm going to um ask them a little bit about his experiences particularly concerning his race and\nThe battle that come with that or perhaps not even that the the unique struggles that come with being a Native American so Cory I'm okay first of all how do you feel about the term like Native American\nI'm personally I'm pretty indifferent to the term but I Know a lot of people were like oh I feel it\nAmerican or like indigenous or first nations I'm an innocent fine with me yeah do you have like a preferred ... I feel like Native Americans because like I've kind of more more widely known\nYeah yeah and and it was just Columbus Day this past weekend I'm so how do you like to\nHave all that is true yeah ... I don't take offense to that either just because it's something that happened in the past but um I can see why people would prefer a digital people's pay\nUh-huh and so you were originally said you could you you were born on the reservation right\n[noise] yeah so I guess technically I was born in Flagstaff, Arizona but only because the reservation didn't have the facilities to properly like facilitate member guy though uh yeah\nWell there are no hospitals and none of them there were there were hospitals but\nMy mom my my mother had like uh I forget what I think that's ... yeah oh yeah so they didn't really have to work where I grew up in an auto Arizona didn't really properly have facilities to deal with that kind of situation to see was um airlifted\nTo Flagstaff oh my gosh wait so did you guys have health insurance or\nA ... actually I'm not sure I don't know the specifics but at least Native Americans that specific hospitals get free health care\nOh okay yeah that's good that's good I'm Glad it because like when you say airlift that immediately my American understanding [laughter] I'm like oh my God that sounds so expensive I Hope you had health care [noise] okay um yeah so\nWhen what age I guess where you living on the reservation\nYeah so I Lived on the road racing from I guess the time that I was born until about and the first great subject thought makes me like what like I said I\nDon't think I think so do you remember\nUm anything about them as a nation or do you have memories I guess you're kind of young\nI really fond memories of the reservation\nThey called a NATO I'm so I Lived in an area called the cornfields because I guess people back in the days there were a lot of course but um so it was very rule and so there is like no self signal\nI'm no Internet uh we had running water but no electricity um\nAnd really like our most of our neighbors were like ... like close family just 'cause like all my family happened to like kind of set up in that area but\nOther than that it was pretty much better in like outside of like a two mile radius\nWow but yet you say that you have on memories in this place so what kind of\nGo I think I think I have ... I feel like with childhood I feel like you kind of make a bunch of fond memories just kind of regardless of where you are but I feel like there were fond memories just because it was like a much simpler life\nI'm so like my fond memories are like kind of hanging out with my grandparents a mother I'm like playing like making pies with like my cousins\nSo I feel like back then I feel like\nAs a child I feel like it's much easier to like create your\nOwn fun not having like technology or not having like like TV yeah yeah and and you grew up on the Navajo Nation yes and I've always reason yeah\nYeah yeah and I guess um do you have any like strong feelings out in the hall I guess I I Do you feel a sense of pride for your tribe kind of situation\nYeah so I Would say I'm I'm always kind of hesitant to feel like very pride for about kind of anything but I Would say that\nI'm not in this I I Would say I'm proud to be Native American and the fact that I I realize that being Native American has like ... like shifted or has contributed to make major development like within my life\nMhm yeah so when you say you lived\nIf the Flagstaff which is in northern Arizona and then we moved to Phoenix\n... do you remember that like moving off the reservation and\n[noise] yeah I think the kind of the hardest feeling um wasn't that like I was like leaving the reservation but like more so that I was like leaving my like my grandpa and grandma where like strong influences like when I was like a child\nSo that will kind of like a hard transition in the movie the Flagstaff and then I go into like moving down to Phoenix just my mom\nMhm mhm and why did you decide to news and like the final here\nYeah so I think I think the um the a big motivating factor was that she wanted to\nLike a she wanted like better a better job like job opportunities and then be like she wanted me to have like a better education it's it's not that the schools on the reservation are like inherently bad it's just that the schools within Phoenix are\nBy and large like better mhm and then um\nThere's not really a lot of job opportunity on the reservation I'm unless you kind of want to do like a lot of like clerical or like administrative work and usually to get those jobs to have kind of have to like know somebody to get those jobs\nMhm yeah so I asked them\nDo a lot of people on the reservation wants to leave that as a nation is that like a sentiment there or ...\nI Would say yeah this is what I Would say a lot of people do want to leave the reservation with the intention of eventually like\nComing back and like like making their own home when they're like like older but I feel like\nI feel like it's just kind of like a common sentiment among young people dislike wanna leave like where they grow up mhm [noise] so I Can't I Can't tell if it's necessarily like they want to leave the reservation because there was a recent or they want to like leave because they're like twenty and they ...\nYeah yeah I totally understand but I mean\nWell yeah I feel like\nWell I wasn't like what am I taught at the time because like you you you can't like want what you've never seen like never never experiencing like the Internet or like people t._v. like it's it's it's not like an active decided that she pursue um but I feel like nowadays\nEspecially like with the proliferation of Internet and people like knowing\nA lot more about the ... like life outside of the reservation I feel like there's probably going to be like a much greater push among teenagers to like wanna leave\nYeah yeah do you want to return to the reservations and a lot of people want to go back to you want to go\n... ... ... like I Want to go back I'm obviously not right now but uh so what am I kind of angles is that I Want to pursue a career in education and I feel like\nAreas are there were some areas of the like reservation they're so like under served under staff\nThat would be ... bike beneficial like for me to like go to like those areas to try to like become like a driving force within its case mhm\nBut you don't necessarily want to do that in the evening after you graduate\nYou're not immediately you lay out my obviously I Want to like may maybe pursue a graduate degree like go again so my teaching experience I mean maybe like figure out if there's any other passions I didn't want to pursue\nMhm but eventually I Would like for that to happen and I go back for the purposes of education\nYeah\nIt must have been paid financially heart for your mom to make that move I guess I mean growing up did you were you aware of I don't know like any financial hardships that your mom I ...\nGrowing up I Would say I would I didn't know that um that the life we were living with\nThat to like go through to like put food on the table so it's six oh I'm so everybody I think one of the biggest in hindsight one of the biggest things that I realize that she did do was that she was the first one like in her family to leave the reservation so she was um [noise]\nSo she's the oldest daughter from my grandma and also the first like of her generation to have a kid\nSo I feel like a real isn't Hines at how much of a struggle that must have been to\nI I for me I'm I'm I'd take a very chilling perspective on on life but I can understand why\nEspecially in the beginning chapters of the history book why a lot of people would kind of take offense you know what the whole like manifest destiny and like you know like essentially genocide but the the way I look at it is that if it's something that happened in the past but I'm not necessarily going to get like angry about it because like\nThe people who are alive today are not the ones who like are committing like those atrocities like several hundred years ago yeah it's like I'm not going to hold it against like an entire like race or like group of people\nLike if they were the ones like themselves like doing those things yeah but I feel like\nIt was kind of a thing where like Native Americans will get mentioned are like some something that happened and then everybody in the class which is kinda like turn to look at you like just because like the like the only Native American in the class but um [noise] other than that like\nThose really awkward for me like during those days we were like learning about American history\nBut I like it but then again like it kind of American history kinda moves on after like that kind of like period that's like a hundred years then you get into like the industrial revolution and then like they'd Americans is kind of stop being talked about in most history books and is there any way you shut them yeah 'cause they're already kind of dial it reservations um\nYeah but ah it was just kind of thing for you like Native Americans were mentioned\nYeah but um yeah and if you sign up for this job yeah I just kind of fat so but I don't like I don't want to make it happen for like one unit in like elementary school or like for like the first couple of weeks and like I don't know us history of high school\nSo it was easier to kind of forget about how awkward those moments word mhm because they would only be for like a couple of days and then you can go on until I get different sects and history\nYeah even feel out or I guess 'cause that's certainly like the facts of um like the history or you could still see today like the fact that you know so we need and then they can still do live on the reservation and that kind of like I mean they can leave but it's a little bit hard to and that kind of like in ... yeah\nSo I Would say like a lot of the things I feel like you just kinda oblivious to like when you're a kid so I I I personally never made the connection of like oh like like I never made the connection to like reading about what happened in history books and then kind of like\nTailoring that to how it connects to like kind of like the life that I've seen when I was like a kid yeah I was just kind of like you know like seeing poverty early problems alcoholism or mhm lots of instruction on like the reservation or what kind of\nA lot of the lack of a like social mobility so I I feel like I never really made that connection like when I was a kid but not in hindsight I really like how that a lot of that came to came into being\nYeah did you ever talk to your mom about it like I'm like oh like like does she ever do you guys ever have like the conversation and not like I'm like the history and make it as a nation and my question off and things like that\nI feel like as I've grown older I feel like I've I've pieced a lot of it of like why you would want to leave I'm like why she left like together myself so I feel like and I feel like she's kind of realize that too so we've never really had like a formal like sit down like with like water and like the kind of like talking through\nBut like I'm I feel like it's it's pretty much like an unspoken agreement\nWhy she wanted to like kinda like we start her life again yeah\nUm oh but I feel like I'm like the conversation about like history I have a lot with my grandparents yeah I'm like specifically one that like my great uncles I like to talk like he's like very very kind of passionate about like um like\nKinda like bringing like the Native American story like back into like popular media but I I feel like\nA lot of people on the reservation especially when you're not as financially well off have a lot more like quote unquote important things to do the my kind of sit around and talking about like history like trying to get like food on the table\n[laughter] yeah yeah but that horrible though because like part of the reason that too many people are struggling to put on the table is because of the history and I don't know I I asked them\nLike I feel like a like a ... like a sense of rage I guess when I read about those stories and now you're so used to ... [laughter] well um\nI Would say I I acknowledge like what happened in the past but I'm like I don't I don't want to hold it against like anybody else in the present day just because all of their ancestors may have been there like committing atrocities against the American it wasn't like\nThe person I'm staring at today like it wasn't Lyn ... doing those things mhm I feel like a lot of people um like they they condemn like what happened\nLike it's it's not considered like okay which is like I like I said I just should be like shouldn't it shouldn't be considered okay so I feel like because a lot of people's like share that sentiment and I feel like it's time to like just kinda like acknowledge what happened but realize that like\nEffort needed me to kind of improve the effects of like what those events cause\nYeah yeah yeah and do you feel like um people are trying to reform like the structures maybe\nLike upper like social mobility ...\n\nComing coming from a prison wasn't lived on the reservation for a long time since I've since like a long time ago [laughter] um I feel like\nFrom this kind of the stories that I hear from like ... like my cousins who live on the reservation my grandparents or like when like when I go back for like Thanksgiving Christmas like spring break\nUm I feel like not a lot like in a formal like political sense has been done to kinda alleviate the situation\nBut I feel like it's a lot easier for like a like my generation or like maybe a younger generation to move off the reservation just because so many people have done it already that like I was saying before like now if you want to go to Phoenix or like Albuquerque you have like such a\nTypically most families have like one or two like relatives who live like off the reservation that if they want to like send one of the kids so I don't know go to school or like\nIf they're older like go send them to like go get a job like started career then they they have people there who they can stay with and provided ... financial support as they like kinda rebuild their lives yeah so I feel like in that sense it's I'm like that's kind of what's kind of improve the situation of that now it's easier to leave than it was back then but like in a\nKind of like a formal like\nReinventing the Navajo Nation has kind of that really happened\nYeah I'm\nI was reading an article the other day and then\nAbout you know the history of the nation and then it was talking about how there are really high rates of domestic violence on the renovation and maybe even like um a lot of people who said drinking alcohol young age\nI'm ... like this I guess have you ever did you have to have those conversations with your parents have an ... about like those types of problems and I I I guess what what was there yeah\nI feel like I was I feel like\nThe domestic violence is kind of like a reality I feel like when you're when you're like living it\nLike you don't ever talk about it but if you look in hindsight that's kind of one of those conversations happen like when you're older and you can kind of like understand like what was happening at the time so I like I grew up in like a very rule on like part of the reservation I just said like surrounded by like extended family\nSo I'm\nLike I Know like I'm like a like minded like extended relatives from like up the road like we're really heavily I'm like really heavy drinkers who would like very frequently get into like domestic disputes like while they were drunk\nI'm so it was it was very much like a reality that what's happening not necessarily like within my own home but I could see like happening like everywhere around me yeah and then so like domestic violence on like third I'd I'd like to know about I remember how memories from my childhood about like\nLike like\nHearing like um like stories or like a like late in the night like something like ... like my grandpa would get like a phone call and he would have to like go like kind of like shuffled like down the road to like break up something\nOh my gosh yeah\nSo but I personally just because I didn't live in those households I never really saw first hand but I saw kind of like\nUm people having to go like break up disputes are like go like kind of carry like Dr somebody like to the hospital or lights kind of like make sure that somebody who doesn't like it too drunk\nSo that'd be like the adults around me kind of had that responsibility but um like me being a kid I never really saw a lot of it first hand yeah\nBut um it was it was definitely something that I was a ... like aware of and it was like five or six like knowing that like occasionally like those people would get like they were drunk and bad things would happen and then like somebody somebody from my house would have to like go step in and ... yeah I like Dr somebody else at the hospital or something\nImagination I feel like a lot of places on the reservation especially like in the rural areas still don't have access to like Internet and I feel like\nFor like lack of a better explanation like drugs like alcohol is just kind of like something that like people turn to just to kind of pass the time just because there's really not much else to do like like when I was a kid I must you want it to go to like the movies it was an hour and a half drive\nTo make like residential program held here at MIT for um like rising seniors\nAnd then that's when I kinda like that's like my first time being acquainted with camp is my first time like leaving like going to like the the eastern half of the United states yeah\nSo it was like I was like a really eye opening experience for me because like every every class was like a struggle mhm because like I'm\nSo or like ... like for a mindset the residential program and you take a like a like a wide variety classes over the course of six weeks and you have like a mid term in a final and at the end you get like course evaluations till I guess that's your academic performance and how much you've grown so um\nI did a lot of like a independent setting it's kind of like on the side and high school so I fortunately during my I I was like I I tested into 'em like physics three biochemistry and like ... three\nSo I got at the time was like what happened when you get like the really good placements like if you're really good about yourself you're like oh yeah I'm like I'm like that that's that's the best in the like and like a good crop of students but then like\nBy the midway through like the courses I was like it's a blessing and a curse because I'm I'm learning new information but because I'm learning new information it's like a lot harder yeah\nSo I feel like that's the first time but I got acquainted like not only with how difficult MIT would be but also with like that the caliber of extraordinary students but also want it to go to MIT like at my students who definitely we're prepared to like\nDo like junior and senior like undergraduate work while they were like only juniors in high school mhm\nAnd that's fun to kind of ... like what it\nWhat it takes\nOn hesitant say what it takes about like what kind of other students also want to go to MIT so that was really after after my junior like that\nBut that's because that's what like that for kids talked about a mites they were like oh what did you get an ethics used like what's your like what's your essay score like what books did you use like online videos you watching like horses do enroll in like that's that that's the first time that I kinda liked\nWas around people for whom academics were a significant portion of their life could go into like a like a just kind of like your average public school like in Arizona\nI'm where like up where the majority of the student population is like non white and also um like financially disadvantaged is like you don't really have academic conversations or you don't really talk about like great just because a lot of people have like significantly like\nOther bigger things to worry about like oh like helping the family of food and table or um like applying for a job rather than like fixing themselves on my test scores and like GPA's\nYeah do you remember um I guess like so after you know you didn't everything up and when you got into my team and I guess how did your family react how do you know you don't think that\nYes I feel like I'm so I applied um\nI applied to like a lot of colleges but like I mean she was really like that to go to the one that I that I knew I was accepted I I was going to go for sure yeah so um\nBut I didn't really\nLike my family you're like friends that like I was applying to like selective colleges really just for fear that I wouldn't get in and that may come near yeah then you'd be like oh yeah I apply but I didn't I didn't I didn't get in so\nI feel like during the actual application process there weren't a lot of people who knew that I was applying to MIT just because like I've just because if I didn't make it in and I would have to tell them that like oh I Know he told you this\nThe only people that knew where like my like my guidance counselor and like my history teacher and my like math teachers at because I Need to like letters recommendation yeah and your mom the game on now ah she knew but I'm\nA she's she didn't have as much of a kind of a perception of MIT that I did ... I mean I think we know it was yeah I like she was she knew more about it than most of my friends but it wasn't like it was it was regarded as like oh it's a college like in the in the northeast yeah yeah but um\nYeah but she's still like held it in high regard it was it was it just wasn't like um she wasn't as passionate about it as I was yeah\nBut um but after you got in which she like really happy after after all she was really happy um like when I first\nLike quote unquote got in with my aunts and that's kind of when she liked it like some researching and she's like what's that like I don't like us you like US News ranking willing I don't like the last ... years yeah you ... do you like oh yeah it's like when she looked at those who was like oh my gosh like this is like actually like a big blizzard like a big deal because I feel like\nI'm I feel that the people who know about that mighty are very passionate about it but I just I feel like it doesn't have like that I'm\nLike the wide audience that like a place like Stanford or like Harvard would have ... where like you hear the name and the kind of like it's kind of stops the conversation yeah so if you actually like I'm with a with MIT if you if you're talking to people who know about the school and like the school's history and like it has an idea of what reputation has\nI feel like bend and those people get excited but um what other people it's just like it's just like another school kind of like you know like I ITT Tech or like um like other like like like a trade school is what kind of sounds like yeah\nBut yeah I remember I remember distinctly I was walking back from school I'm walking back in school\nYeah I applied it tied to its like march working so was I was like a hundred and my two degrees out I was like walking back and schools like sweating profusely unlike all of a sudden my phone vibrating like a lot 'cause I have I have a group chat with on like a lot of people I met during my mhm\nAnd then all of a sudden like I like Glenn set my phone and as I see like pictures of like acceptance letters certain like flood in ... and I'm like oh that's today so I knew it was like march fourteenth and I knew was going to come out some time when I'm\nA ... my infinite wisdom I miscalculated what time it was because of the difference I thought it was I thought it was going to come out at I thought it was gonna come out at nine PM yeah because I added three hours when I should have to practice three hours yeah\nYeah but um so I I look at my phone number ... oh like acceptance letters are coming out the flooding in like all my friends are getting accepted like ... and then\nI was kinda paused 'cause I was like oh that means I have to check to like I now now now I'm going to know like within the next five minutes I just kind of like stood there on the street I'm like there was like nobody around and I heard I was like a dog barking the distance\nAnd it's kinda like I I log in 'em to like my MIT account like playing like a like application count\nAnd then there's this this ... this one final screen where they where it's on like you have to click like view\nDo decision yeah and then like they have they have like a very thankfully MIT has this very long winded paragraph of like your colleagues had been like this not if I like to find you have to like that I many successful students like as you as you click that no like no this information that like your your self worth just not defined by like getting accepted into like one college\nFor like reading that like I'm already like shaking I'm like oh like what happens if it was when I left the Senate yeah like if it is it's a carrier for voting like it's it's not a good message yeah but like so I stand there with like my finger hovering above\nI really ready to know mhm [noise] do I really like want to know so it's kind of standard like on the street corner like sweating like with my finger above the button for like two minutes and finally I must have the courage to like click the button and then of course like the first thing you see is like the your Corey and then\nCongratulations thankfully I saw congratulations thought it was like\nI kept reading it and re reading I couldn't get past the first sentence I kept reading and just to make sure it was like oh like I read I read congratulations but I I wanted to be sure that I was reading was what I thought I was reading so I read it for like\nI read it over and over again for the next like five minutes just kind of like make sure that I was I was correctly feeling happy about what I think that happened\nLike finally I realized that\nI got accepted like I like it wasn't it wasn't like a cleric or like error I got accepted like I read the word congratulations correctly like class like admitted to clog like lots of like two thousand twenty two\nAnd then I immediately I'm ... I felt like sprint down the street like like like yelling at the top of my lungs I like tears streaming down my face because like I never expected this happened\nI'm I'm Still like sweating profusely theirs looks like so the dog park in the distance it was really like an ... it's really weird just because I was so happy but the world around me which is like still sort of like a\nLike normal yeah huh\nDo people like if I make like comments not like oh like you only got in because you're a minority and yeah that was that was a really common argument of like oh I Would I Would be told like I have like the best chance because I'm low income person or a Native American like I'm like I'm like I'm a shoo in for college and they said that uh like\nLike a a lot of like a question ... none of the teaching of the faculty but like a lot of the ... like a lot of like a\nNot friends 'cause my friends never say that but like acquaintances I pass or by it'd be like oh you would hear like\nA mix

we have probably from around the fifties I Want to say maybe forty and then we started coming up in the decades or next when I was ... with a shovel the new and or that one was uh the song's called V. they bought ... be the ...\nAnd ah that one I saw was the best one from my played a main reason is because it's not tied to a European rhythms it's a\nA that one was actually incorporating a lot of uh some of these more African rhythms um and in part because the artist is the is an African as an African a Brazilian person I'm\nRich you know all the other or is that I played are more a light skinned more European or The Simpsons and I'm\nFrom the Argentine in ones which are also very much a European are dominated are sounds are the residents of tomato is is uh\nYeah [noise] um it's got that but\nWe continuing on with a series you race and apparently this one was hilarious song I did not understand it myself but\nAh Amy was cracking up addict or talking about a a a guy who\nMargaret food I they're not quite understand but [laughter] um it's either way it's a it's a younger guy that enjoys the the the older females\nOr\nIs it even gone we then er moved up to ... new and short auto\nAnd that that's the only way that they had there was a few of the car bailout and or that one was a a a live version of that a more cruise version but ah they were some of the first ones to really try to push a out of the regional area I mean they're your race he's got he had the whole thing about being an actor that\nKind of put them up or on the on the platform or people to see but are these other guys are\n... they are that are on a collaboration that people like whoever's Carlos and uh the up to more of a pop sound um and even think he started to take cues from American country music\nAnd how they are how they were able to ah stay up to date the uh\nDefinitely more modern sounding song there are firmly under the law in an article on the top ... I'm In fact they decided you know let's get rid of the accordion and so um is the fact that they've been having according was a so notable that even Fred woke up to tell me that\nUh but after that the last time we play was from Gustavo Lima a lot of ... too which is a\nA now there's this new brand of a music I set the major it's not really even music from the countryside anymore now it's a very popular among the young people I'm In college and whatnot the fat boys are but we're gonna continue on them to the next country and this was going to take over the rest of the hour because\nWhy this is the best of all the music that we're listening to today I'm but I'm unlike the other ones the\nThis or this genre in particular I took the accordion because\nYou are you got the ... and then the the Dutch in these very close to Venezuela and some way or another the according slipped into a one of the valleys of Columbia and\nThen there are mostly indigenous a dissent than people I mean ... must be so with these are people ah took John ... took the instrument I made their own music\nOr so the the German influences not quite as a as deep um but it's got four they've just got a five different styles of music that they were going to look at three uh types of rhythm so we're going to start off here with uh the oldest on your phone and that was from LA will go down with a song or at least ...\n... ... yeah\n\nTo Don Don majoring\nIn no way they are being done by\nDon they let me just by\n\nThese yeah\nBut um\n\nTo John bone that me and they let me bring your friends and my mom lives down the road\nThe door on the bottom\nThat\nThan I\nDo love yeah he'll be bad or what you have all that they've all been ... years ago la la land yeah he'll be bad what yeah boil enable da\n\nDa da da\nDa da\nDa da da da da\nDa\nDa da da da da da\nDa da\nDa\n\nWell not if you put a\nPocket there you'll not paying dogs are getting older you got to be not paying them to get a lot sooner I got hooked\nBack to supply will be able to get testimony goes on and off it would be able to get into it but I\nCan't say that I got\nTo go that way when\nI was yeah I'm just I'm not I'm not being so young I but I don't mind [laughter]\nYeah I did not want to talk about my dad didn't windows in the bed and I'm about to go outside I can tell you about saying no not\nThat young boy he'll pull down there and I'm not on the book to bomb going\nBut I'm not on during the blackout all the time but he also did not know that\nThat the man I Will do the job and they may have been my best\n\nWas his performances were like but uh yeah it's the most popular on sale is a kind of like a myth temple um\nUh for for a standard time er and usually it can be about anything some people use it to write love songs that people use it to write tails I'm a things are about their their people are it's a it's literally like the most um [noise]\nThe the most malleable of all of the ... or the rhythms um after that we played I mean it was a ... from ah that one was a song written by Jeff ... let's go now and let's go to when I was um he was a composer uh\nUh we had to call him a tribute to her or [laughter] or listen to it on Thursdays but uh he he wrote a lot of the songs a lot of the songs that are most famous from my end after he was a very very good song writer and I think he elevated the songwriting and buying an apple\nOr to the next level um 'cause he he was about um and\nUh I think that's that's something that some of the other genres might have been lacking or somebody to take delivery system to the next level butler system is very important inviting them um\nBut I mean I guess a ... they're not the same as the ... is is is a but it's still kind of like a little bit more upbeat is not quite as popular though are the second most popular one is ... which is that there is something play there are\nSome of the replay it was up and that's what I called the ... and that one was on Jeopardy by their ... brothers ... and ... um for a compilation called a hundred\nCNN News the Capitol or a hundred years of my you're not them or was released a about two decades ago so probably a hundred and\nIt's essential collection a bite out the music that we have to this day and um [noise] yeah we we have one of those at home and I grew up with listening to that collection of a a sixties sixties music um\nOr performers trying to capture or the first wave of up all the old way and I have two or in its in its original form\nUm but boy yeah is the kind of like a very fast rhythm it's a one of the six eight were them or so is\nYeah this is a very quick and I'm usually meant to be a company with like parity or like songs that are more light hearted or some of them are definitely more biting um in terms of what the concept is but it's always like light humored\nA you always know that you're going to get your you're going to laugh when you listen to that rhythm so is that something just into the rhythm itself tells you what the song is going to be like um\nBut the last told me that play there was a ... ... ... ... another old performer from the first generations and or the ... is very popular song called fear\nAnd uh I've tried to play as original versions that could cause these lyrics have changed over time\nOr he himself has added stances and a later when Carlos ... is a covered it he also added a few more stances so but let me tell you a little bit a quick translation of what it is he basically within a few this guy Indiana was in a few with this other guy called a\nLawrence let me get more rallies or what a lethal as he as he was known for\nA so over here are so he he sort of the song saying this is basically this track and this is back back in the day before hip hop before a I mean I'm sure there's other generals have distract but this is like\nLike a similar to like in hip hop or you have in a lot of these shows you have to\nTo the music itself but this one was the most popular them all he's basically saying um\nThat are more lethal I heard that you were in a in the meantime the other day and uh you didn't want to party you you left that same morning or it must have been from the anger from the rage of a of the last burned that I gave you a lethal\nYou thought you thought that you were gonna win he thought that you were going to uh take me down um\nBut once you once they saw me once he heard me play you got caught up in the cold sweat and close was the name of the song\nUm\nAnd then once once he heard my music\nYou're a you're shot like your gun shot or a myth fired a\nThen uh over here you also saying something about like a a I heard you name drop my mother are only so you could offend me so so for
