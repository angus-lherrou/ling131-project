difficulties and we didn't quite make it tell when I Am so yeah I Am a real this time I'm\nGoing to show you a few things I'm this show is it's a\nMusic it's an indie show for those of us who spend a lot of time in the band rehearsal room in high school\nI'm going to play a bunch of Indian pulp and folk and probably funk and punk and all of that um but using those instruments that you're familiar with from high school symphony orchestra or Tim funny hall downtown\nThat covers horns strings accordion harmonic because all across the board I've been trying to be real brought about it\n'cause honestly it's just the music that I Love the most is\nI mean you know I tried to be cool but\nAll my favorite stuff is kind of a throwback to Beethoven\nI'm so without further ado I'm going to start out the set with a song by Mary up or the u._k. artist I Believe called long gone I mean just skip that\n\nThe ball\nLa\nDe\n...\nYeah na\nNa\nOh\n\n\n\nThey're all bad\n\n\nDa da da da and long ago by Mary up where and what a horn section of my friends uh I heard that one on a\nThat by chance um occurred to me to believe how amazing it was I mean I feel is a I Can't remember why I was listening to it but you know several years old now um and that was really a gym that I found\nJust getting my next\nSong up I Can't remember what it is yeah so this show called the philharmonic as my backing band I went through a bunch of names um but the point is\nI used to play cello and school and so I grew up with classical music kind of along side all the contemporary stuff I listened to and since then all of my favorite songs of always incorporated\nYou know the the instruments that I heard in rehearsal off um [noise] my very favorite song which I don't think I'm playing tonight and say we get for a special occasion is that song up the wolves by the mountain goats was just incredible cello solo\nUm and now is the kind of stuff that when I heard it as a teen I was like oh man I gotta stickers this music thing it's a really good [laughter] I remember trying to learn the that that's so low myself and failing of course but\nYou know it was inspiring um\nSo yeah that's what this shows about um hopefully that comes across talk to people about it and not everybody totally gets it but the idea yeah it's just\nYou want to be cool you want to listen to modern music but she makes you cry you know\nI'm\nThat's pretty much all I've got to say about this show and I want to just get right to their music\nUm which is off of the recent mountain goats album not the one I was talking about earlier but I'm from God a and the sons called painting cocaine\nA feature is an excellent saxophone and no guitar that was the thing for this this album alright here we go\n\n\n\n\nHi there you're

section and that brings in the editorial Labor Day of baseball [noise]\n\n[noise] this kind of behavior wasn't unique to football players and frat boys but it was certainly more prevalent in those circles and more accepted\nI didn't have any friends in that crowd in high school my interactions with them were limited to being shouted at as I walked past them in the cafeteria for some of the fence related to my uh feminine appearance or political buttons I knew a boy who played football in the rural neighborhood in northwestern Connecticut where I spent almost every summer of my youth though\nWe didn't have much in common and didn't hang out much but there were only a few kids around on the mountain and we all came from out of town or in his case out of state\nAnd together pretty often I hadn't seen this boy in years since we were both ... and then years later I saw him one summer when he was visiting the mountain briefly\nFor some reason he started telling me about what he said he had very recently done back in his home town I assume he was telling the truth because it's hard for me to imagine why anyone to brag about such a thing\nHe said he had been at a party and some suburban high house where another high school student a girl had drunk too much alcohol and it was passed out on a bed in the bedroom he told me he went into the bedroom pulled their clothes off and raped her\n[noise] I don't think he used that word but that's plainly what he was describing having sexual intercourse with a sleeping girl he didn't know obviously very non consensual sex by any conceivable definition\nYou then went on to laugh about how hard it was to put her clothes back on you talked about how much he needed to accomplish this task in order to try to hide his crime though he also didn't use that word\nI don't know if he expected some kind of solidarity from me but I thought he might have been looking for some kind of empathy or understanding\nAll I could think about was what a horrible thing that was to do to someone but it seems so unreal at the time and the people involved so distant in some other state an unknown victim to me and an assailant I barely knew\nI knew many such stories mostly the about fathers who beat my friends their children there were many fathers like that in the suburbs of Connecticut I knew not to tell adults about any of it I don't know why I Know that\nBut I eventually forgot about the story and I don't think I told anyone about it until last week I remembered it because of Dr Ford Senate hearing and now it's all I can think about\nI Wonder if that girl was on the other side of the country from me and some others suburb I'd never been in that sounded a lot like the one where I grew up and out here I Am\nWell a salt survivor on the radio talking about how completely most kids lack any kind of education in the concept of consent and other essential things they need to understand well before they ever become sexually active\nAs a parent it seems to me that the best thing we can do overall is to raise kids in a way that they know they matter deeply and everybody else does too we need to break the cycle that continually produces more male violence [noise]\nThis will require completely transforming our schools and just about every other aspect of so called popular culture that is shut down our throats daily by the rape culture that produced those scenes in Animal House and other movies that have been a news so much lately [noise]\nAnd we also need to raise powerful self confident passionate

they're one of the regular to hug festival every year and they were certainly marching through the streets of some of the island to Cambridge this past weekend I was hoping to actually prevent some of the original recording I did there but we shouldn't even at a time protecting pretending most of the material\nOh I think that they are just reinforces the message that this ... the way that women have been treated for millennia\nI think men men protecting themselves in protecting their power it's the culture of um sexual assault of violence that's the culture that we live in the culture of women hating\nAnd um but I don't think it's going to work at the time I really don't I think too many women have spoken out too many women are on the line I mean I was up on the hill all last week a and even the day um women were flying in one of our interns flew in with a group from her school University of Iowa\nTo testify that people were holding a filibuster on the um on the Capitol Grounds that went on for over twenty four hours we're not going to stop we're going to take back\nOur legislatures across this country and we're going to win in twenty Eighteen and the anger is not going to go away and no matter how gleeful they are\nThey are the mom they act like the mob they actually had actually act like the mafia their tyrants and we're not going to put up with it any longer we're going to put women in power\nInto the seat even though they've gerrymander them and we're going to keep on keeping until we take this country back what we're seeing going on now\nIs really more than just about women in sexual assault and sexual harassment this is the backlash against our first black president said this is not just about women this is about racism and we have to be honest about that they may not be saying that right now but that's that's a big piece of this is the racism\nThe white supremacy that's also going on the hatred in this country these people that are in power rightly right now are very very ugly people\nKnow impeaching terminal as one of the options here if the Democrats to control the house of representatives a lot of analysts say that's a long shot because the peace process can be started but they need to\nProcess itself is is worth investing politically and\nI Do I think that it is really a good ... you know people\nThat are liberal that wake up in the morning and they want fairness for all believe that this process was rotten from the start\nAnd I think that we have to talk and teacher and I think that we have to use every single avenue and not say okay well there's no way that we can get two thirds of the senators so therefore we shouldn't try now we have to keep pushing forward we can't just decide that something has already been decided before it's even been determined\nWe have to keep our voices strong and loud we have to let them know we're not going to go way they're not going to get away with is we are taking steps to stop them\nWith a five to four conservative majority now established on the U.S Supreme Court whether some your biggest concerns\nAbout Supreme Court rulings going forward in of course is a lot of concern out there about reproductive rights labor rights environmental regulation and climate regulation ... deregulation of Wall Street of social safety net programs\nOf overturning criminal justice reforms civil rights voting rights all GBDs cue writes the list goes on and on\nYeah it does they want to rewrite America they wanna drag us back to the bad old days and uh\nWho knows what's gonna happen with that they're also filling up not just the Supreme Court but the other the other federal benches and the other courts where they are allowed to a point that's why it's so important that we get to the polls that we both vote them out of office that we did get the Democratic majority\nIn both the house and the Senate and now it's going to be working\nTo put more women into office and to do just that that's\nOut of office\nThat was Tony Van Pelt president of now the national organization for women learn more about what now and other groups across the country are doing to protect hard one legal and legislative victories from being overturned by the new conservative Supreme Court majority\nBy visiting our between the lines website at BPL online dot org\nThousands of unaccompanied immigrant children are being held in detention by the U.S government with many being transferred to a refugee tent camp in the middle of the Texas desert\nMany of these children are eligible for relief but have almost no chance of success without a lawyer kids in need of defense or kind is a national organization whose mission is to provide pro bono attorneys to immigrant children in deportation proceedings\nKind trains these lawyers who often come from the corporate world and then matches attorneys to children fewer than half the children in detention of attorneys when they appear in court\nAs a mid September some twelve thousand eight hundred immigrant children were being held in custody of the health and Human Services department\nThe backlogs that has developed in moving these children through the legal process\nIs in part the result of potential sponsors being afraid to come forward for fear of being deported themselves and the government's decision to prioritize the cases of children the Trump Administration separated from their families at the border earlier this year\nBetween the lines Melinda to who's spoke with Jennifer ... call policy director with kind he or she explains the roll her organization plays in children's deportation cases in recent developments and the plight of immigrant youth\nEvery person said the government is I have a right to have to remove a proceeding\nSo they have to make their own case so they have to have a\nUnderstanding of us immigration laws to understand why they would have some sort of right to be here is it because they actually did have some sort of these or is it because they're asking for humanitarian protection and they want to make an application for humanitarian protection and so it's really absurd to think that somebody\nFirst of all who doesn't speak English let alone have an understanding of US law let alone have an understanding of us immigration law would be able to make a case for themselves in court without a lawyer and it's even more absurd when you think about a young child\nSo when they are represented by attorneys how did these kids' fare\nMost of the kids that were representing almost all of them are\nApplying for some sort of humanitarian protection meaning you know they either suffered harm in their home country or they would suffer harm if they had to go back and so that could be an application for asylum\nThat could be an application for special immigrant juvenile status which is a special visa given to children who were abused or abandon are neglected and a judge has determined it's not their best interest to go back to their country\nThere is something called the trafficking visa so for someone who for a child has been the victim of human trafficking they might be eligible for a special visa and so these forms of relief\nGranted to children and if they win their case there is an eligible to apply for what's called referred to as a green card so that they could stay and live and work in the United states\nYou know and I will tell you that when kind is able to screen cases you know make that determination about who we think might qualify and who we think might be better off if they return to their home country when we're able to screen the case and represent the child to the end of their case we have an incredibly high success rate how high is it\nSo if we're able to screen the case and represent the child to the end if they're\nFurious you said these cases are hard to prove and I imagine these kids come with little or no documentation so how do you have such a high success rate\nI mean it's amazing you know these these attorneys who take the case says particularly a promoter attorneys I mean the amount of resources that they put into these cases is really amazing\nUm and so it depends what kind of application the child is applying for\nIf they're applying for asylum you know there's a lot of research that goes into what's happening in the home country and trying to cooperate with the child said about what happened experts can provide testimony so it depends on what kind of application a child is making\nWhat can you tell us about the expanded detention center for unaccompanied immigrant children in the desert attorney in South Texas\nThe government is running ... as an emergency overflow a shelter for kids and it's the office of refugee resettlement that's in charge of providing care in custody to unaccompanied children until they can find a sponsor in the U.S is willing to care for them while they go through their court process\nWhat's happening in ... as the government has implemented some policies that is making it harder for children to reunify with a sponsor so kids are really backing up\nIn the system and the detention system so are are as had to resort to opening you know what they're referring to is uh some urgency facility torn you know and it has over three thousand beds and they're over three thousand children can be how they're and they're holding children between the ages of Thirteen and Seventeen both boys and girls there\n\nAnd that I can I say tomorrow night maybe we can at five thirty for half our news from the viewpoint of British radio WBEZ when I'm with you and I had a very\n\n\n\nWe are in Cambridge um this is pretty city radio with

L. C. S. um it's good to see the Bruins back on track I'm a I'm not watching football this year a but up until now it's been really good to uh see the patriots success at them\nYeah [laughter] uh I have some reverse opinions as someone from Seattle but if you were a Boston my wife's eye where bosses fan I can see how that is a good time I'm to be alive\nUh anyway so back to what we're talking before it ... should we should we take a ... place sweet Caroline it's not local but it feels very local and I've got to ask very true I I Would love it I Will be singing along here in the studio\nOkay let's say that first and they will continue talking about real stuff I'm not saying sports isn't real\n...\n[noise]\nWhere it began yeah\nBut then I Know I grew up in ... um\n[noise]\nUm\nMan\nAgain [noise]\n\n[noise]\nLittle bit below nine and do the same solo man we delay it all boils all they\nYou're in\nAnd [noise]\nI\n[noise]\nMan man\n\nSaying no\nRight now they don't\n\n\n[noise]\nManly man and [noise]\n\nYeah I remember my face Red Sox game and didn't know that I didn't know that this was like a thing that people that after the eighth inning yep yeah and I was just surprised that it was like very like cute and heartwarming [laughter] in some ways\nI mean it does make me feel really great when I'm walking or when I'm walking in the area or\nIn the evening and I hear people from Fenway like blocks away\nOr a singing along to the song yeah\nIt is interesting how definitional sports is to the Boston psyche for at least from an as an outsider's perspective on it um yeah I Would say famous slashing notorious for for sports success uh\nYeah I ... that's actually very recent up until\nUp until the\nEarly to thousands of a Red Sox had very well documented futility the patriots were one of the worst teams in the NFL yes I'm a bit and the ... pride in their sports team like has that increased over the last Twenty years as well our ... I I mean there was a there was talk actually I'm\nIn the early ... thousands of the patriots moving to a St Louis ... oh yeah to uh become a\nA football team there until the LA Rams moved there um and the uh the owner of the team Robert Craft was intent on uh keeping the team here and buy here I mean Fox for Massachusetts which is very much at Boston\nI'm though it's just kind of like a field like as a spur of Boston extending as an arm no that's not true\nThat so much I mean I think a lot of Bostonians kind of do you think do you think of Fox Brothers as like a a very separate entrance way cool yeah\nAnd I realize the patriots were like the New England patriots and not in the Boston [laughter]\nI'm a lot of the sports teams here that you know the Boston Celtics and the patriots and the the Bruins in the red Sox probably enjoy the same geography of New England up until about central Connecticut I'm Esther I'm as the\nYou know as one another regardless of how they're named but I think what they do kind of represent is or even if it wasn't a ... if if it wasn't always success I think burns had some success before the two thousands in the eighties and nineties Celtics obviously have a lot of success with Iraq way back when way back in the ...\nUh I think it was at a sweeping [laughter] ah but I I mean I think what really defined Boston sports in a way that I think it also kind of defined one cultural aspect to Boston is is actually the idea of ... um there's a lot of uh\nValor in being kind of like a an underdog being really gritty like being very working class in this town um which I think represents one is two distinct cultures that have like long prevented the idea of what it means to be bused in\nWhat's the other one the other one is the boss and Brian um which is uh both uh I think is represented by both like uh [noise]\nUh as far as I Know like a landowner in class and like an educated class um\nBoston was founded as like a ... like in the city on a hill model mhm uh with ... literally being where are the the peak of Boston was um although of course there are a couple of other health bunker hill\nI'm speaking has not very tall anymore necessarily I don't know but I uh I mean there's a reason that um\nThat that neighborhood really did like has historically been exactly what it is which is a kind of higher income or\nIt's like I'm a strong a kind of elite class to go along with a another class of people which is you know a lot for working class a lot more for the call her a lot more um I Would say a lot more immigrant focus so a lot of the Boston problems as far as I Know we're uh\nWe're closer to the first wave of immigration to Massachusetts followed by a larger Italian and Irish a wave of immigration\nWhich constitutes I'd say the scrappy are greedy or Boston at least historically and now obviously there are a lot of other uh uh immigrant populations that have made their way in a visibly or unfortunately maybe a little bit more in visibly\nI think uh I think there's a really interesting story about the MBTA um Walter O'Brian a restaurant party candidate\nAnd the and the way in which the a ... you know the uh the country's oldest subway system was formed so um [noise]\nI Know that the the green line was the uh first subway um system in the country\nI'm as the as the system expanded it you know I picked up more aligned with the most uh I guess the most recent lines being the silver lining in the blue line but then um I don't know if anyone is anyone more familiar than I Am with the construction of the orange line\nYes [laughter] and you wrote a book I wrote a thesis about it right now I'm going to I'm Sorry that was not real [laughter] description um so my under graduate thesis here at MIT was about um the movement to tear down a\nOr to cancel a few plans that I'm for highway building that was going to basically destroy the ah social and I'm physical fabric of Boston and I'm One of the successes of that movement was um\nWere able to change federal law to allow for some of that\nOrange line I'm used to be an elevated line or Boston used to have a bunch of elevated lines but the Washington state street orange line was the last one to be torn down and then they read about it the or and then when they were building this new underground or an ... an\nUnderground orange line um they've changed riding a bit so that it goes through um J. P. to go to force health as opposed to X. ray and then in two thousand two they put in the silver line which is not a real subway [laughter] now it's not that way\nIt was theoretically built to specification of light rail so you could it was built with the intention to make it forward compatible so you could put a light rail on those in that right away with minimal disruptions in for a better quality of service more people per vehicle et cetera\nI'm fortunate in that tunnel or on the street as well in the in the tunnel I'm through to the seaport however there were some\nUh funding issues the federal government and maybe we're getting to in the weeds the federal government refuses to provide funding for a new transportation projects unless you can prove that trips will be generated that makes that worth the investment um the seaport at that time was not developed\nAnd so ... Boston was unable to say like we're definitely going to build this even though they knew they were definitely gonna build it\nUm so the federal government refused to provide them all the funding they needed and the ... statement said he couldn't agree on a funding split and so the silver line comes above ground for crossing the street um and it's a whole it's a whole mess now\nAnd then that that part and it was actually we're replacing where the old elevated Washington street line uh was was on Washington street which goes to deadly square which is another pie of December line which is not connected to the seaport an airport prior to sever line another piece that got cut and that's something to\nI Do think that's really interesting but for for its its ramifications of how the how how does that a project came together and how to pieces fit or don't fit together but also because uh if you ever have to take the silver line to or from the airport during rush hour you having to go above ground makes that trip miserable [laughter]\nThere's actually a I'm a ... small rampant in the area that's a land controlled by Massport um but where there's that state police station there's a ramp directly to the highway that the the civil and bus was intended to take to cut off the whole trip past the ... on the convention center and everything would say about twenty minutes on your overland trips airport\nBut due to 'em\nRight of way disputes and the state police insisted that they needed that route and the Massport was unwilling to kind of re evaluate the status quo it's anyway we'll see where that goes um\nBut it's a it's it's a complicated it's a complicated legal and governance issue that's me I had a much more difficult trip for it really ... yeah\nSo what we've learned in planning school and that most of the issue stem from a politics and governance [laughter] all working together as opposed to what actually fits in infrastructure way [laughter] yeah that's very true people MSG\nI'm\nSo coming up next we I Believe we have um a number of songs from from local bands yeah um that's something we we like to do he chose to to highlight some music that is is from that city and uh you know\nOf the moment maybe some vents that than don't get as much exposure to and he said did you want to yeah do you only want to play that my first Fisher oh I'm so the buffers

about cycling generally we talk about the things that we love about cycling and the one of the ways that we kind of coalesce dot\nThat's not to blame the diamond string a phone number ... someone's trying to call us ... much articles I haven't ... let's see if anyone's on the line and wants to talk to a well just give it a minute and the mean time for\nThe next topic that we're looking to do is actually traveling with gear on our bikes so as we talk about a little bit earlier I was recently on a trip and so the first part of the trip I was self supported\nAnd has as carrying on my ... year but I did stay in Arabic envious of country that I did not writing and then I bring a tent with me doesn't\nJust with different kinds of things like car camping versus hiking into the White Mountains\nThat's true it was also going to be a little colder\nAnd it rained half the time that I was like self supported so yeah you just want to be warm and dry and I but the YouTube overhear Miranda and ... on the line or on the line on the air with us and I also did a self supported right so let's say a little bit about\nGear and you know how do you carry everything sounds like there was a maybe a debate about the best way to carry\nThings are [laughter] there was I think the phone is um let's take a call on let me pause\nFor a moment ago oh hello ...\nAnyone anyone on the line [laughter] any low hello ... no\nAll right well we'll keep moving forward so governor keep on calling back we we were trying to stay on the air that you on the year um [noise] but uh in the meantime let's talk about going after the prevalent\nThat sounded like the phone was on and then hung up\nWe have 'em but you know this is great radio but let's talk about [laughter] or riding up to Portland so how did you guys\nThis day and we say that they're being be and someone do the job I hung up and stuff and now he was all sort of like organizational thing and we ended up carrying all access the second day and it was pretty much everything I guess except for tens because we did stay with someone but we all had sleeping bags and food\nAnd I guess we didn't really have camp stove or anything 'cause we didn't stay in the house up and [laughter] you bring your own water [noise]\nNo we just ... grocery store I mean we were just on the well part of it was on the bike path like a path and some of it was sort of on a highway and we stopped at some grocery stores and some coffee shops and it's it's not like you know you're in the middle of nowhere and my wife's care\nBrings I have a hundred or I have twenty miles between me and my next availability of water and I'm a big cut and I drink a lot of water so it's just one of those things that like I'm always kind of like hyper aware of where am I give him in the water hold me one or both will have on me but you all had enough places to like stop and do that\nYeah that's I mean most of it there was like different businesses and restaurant I'm trying to think of where we actually did stop we a sense of time with the Hannah firms grocery store and yet when he ...\nA [laughter] born and raised I Can't help you out [laughter]\nBut that was actually just a side note real quick about my favorite things so I had mechanical issues on my way out to Nova Scotia and I had stopped in Portland it's going to spend twenty four hours there anyway visiting family friends so when I had issues is really great 'cause\nThey could drive made a ... bike shop to get the bike repaired and I left my\nExcuse me I left my bike with them and we went to the grocery store down the street and so for some reason just like maybe being back in your home town or whatever it is\n[laughter] it's just being able to be like yeah I'm local I Know [laughter]\nI used the lingo I thought it was these out as her to ... uh well my mother never let me speak like adamant accent uh so you've had a real maybe\nThat is not true and I will fight [laughter] oh ... oh\nSo yeah go you're a dying thing here\nI'm a war said the thing that Abby and I kept debating is that I like to carry everything on Iraq on the back of my bike I have a big like a pair of ... everything in there um and I don't I mean each side one on each side yeah sometimes I'll do just want if it's like not quite enough to fill them both but I can slowly and some time yeah\nUm but I don't like having anything on the front 'cause I like to ride with our hands sometimes like giving my wrist and by sometimes she means like Seventy five percent of the time were worse if Elizabeth\nI'm just like any time I look over at random or writing she's like on her phone or\nJust like a good actor or sharing the experience\nWith someone else yeah those are good things are good for not cars or anything around when writing it I Would never do anything [laughter] but also words mean for every proof is in putting Miranda standing here before it\nSafe in the whole\nAlso be a huge hypocrite after all the photos and videos [laughter] that was like I'm just going to take a bunch of videos here's me talking about some thing on the coast gravel road all of\nUs yeah I gotta\nDo should or should yeah but so the thing is then you can't\nThat was a problem for me are totally agree with you I totally agree with you I mean I Can't have that much I Can't have any way in the bars like you know for the same reason you do I get my hands off my boy sometimes too\nYou know and it just totally and I guess my wrists just get really tired out and so especially just having not wait there it's so much more work
