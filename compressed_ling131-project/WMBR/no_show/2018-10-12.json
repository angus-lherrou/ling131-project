um\nWith regard to climate change and what's interesting is that I struggled with that because Puerto Rico had not gone through a hurricane\nFun but like all of this data is kind of\nConjecture like my questions were very hypothetical like what would you do for hurricane happened and a lot of the responses I got were well you know in some parts of the island a hurricane hitting a hundred years so\nIt was interesting to hear what people would do but that was it tested it anyway so I kind of came back really interested in doing more work there but nothing conclusive from a research perspective\nThen Hurricane Maria happens and that completely changed the game and suddenly even though I really still felt like I didn't know much about Puerto Rico and our department pretty much turned and said ... what do we do\nAnd honestly I was like in my head I was like I don't know if I like outwardly I was like okay well there's that impulse that you feel as a plan or\nTo do some things and to do it as ethically as you can it's so a lot of things happened and long story short the department funded this class um to take a bunch of students to Puerto Rico and keep looking at the disaster and infrastructure and recovery on the island so that was the during\nUm and then the after part is this other long emotional moment for me that I think is going to be\nPretty um\nKnow it gets unlimited in terms of how long I feel like I'll be engaged with this conversation because now the people that I initially started off interviewing\nAre now friends notches informants or interviewees and the people that I Want to check on him to check on me and I see them when I'm there and they see me when they're here [noise]\nUm and so there's this personal emotional state that I've developed with the island um almost unintentionally and very much\nIsland in January of twenty eight teams three months after Maria on a research scoping trip with MIT while there she found parts of the island to be markedly different changed following Maria\nI think this quiet really stuck out to me and before the hurricane the times that I've gone to the island there was always music there are always people on the street\nThings were always open and\nYou'd always hear something but then when I went back in January twenty teens are kind of scope out when it happened after the hurricane season it was just really quiet and areas that usually aren't going down like shops were close and then it's like to say the old neighborhood raised to live like\nRestaurants weren't open and they're\nNot that many cars around and I thought that was really strange I think from a sound perspective like the silence is something that stuck out quite a bit have\nSmaller significant differences such as these revealed the impact of hurricane on daily life even months after and the time that followed the hurricane outsiders and mean landers attempted to provide relief and often we're the ones with the available resources to do so just had its own pitfalls both logistically an ideologically\nThese conflicts continue today\nWith the help of we are the ones that are violent ... from New York though was really really rooting for them to have the will be maybe a people that you know a local scary\nAnd ah how old all the layers them all that you had information they share formation in order to ... author of all the people you're saying\nAre we really need to community sensors at each other in order to be able to stop things because\nIf people are not getting to places we buy a car\nThere were also and legal there were people that they were never before the violin or we were really important and that each will address that became a problem and\nThere weren't too many I mean are people in the New York he became a ... ah [noise] so what we call them up or available or the people that were committed\nAs ... tells um yeah that was the ... off from a plan or on the city of San Juan I'm actually explained outside interests and contention with good intentions um and they've yellow resources often locked 'em a certain knowledge of the local and the idiots and caught ec\nCommunication with chicken really difficult and I'm Out in ... presentations of various resources on the local scale was really crucial\nAnd the longer recovery different levels of government have often been less than effective in courting these efforts recovery is um a friend of mine ... messy and convoluted process and Puerto Rico or even more so\nThe honest dodge got Puerto Rico has always had a complicated relationship with the mainland and the territory when it's on culture history and heritage but we were there we observed street art on the sides of free weights in buildings on which often featured the phrase like ... or the oldest colony\nThe notion that Puerto Rico Roman ... compounded with the federal government's neglect following disaster that was Maria was something that had a variety of him\nThe Beijing has been diminished swim minimum and it's really awkward to have a federal government or local warming solution to expand on her own invasion when\nIt is something that Jim in a rush to Congress and four and a history of money\nOn a lot of money and it would be that it would be expected to backwards I work at the local government to a more understanding scope I'm a worst Senate cats meat on\nAnd so now that I'm more humane and vision on\nHow to approach to the community but eater notch like Sarah [noise] so it's a real challenge to try to make some harmony happen between rep settles said on most people babbling on\nWhat is in the absence of that money\nAnd people have no option whatsoever that go just go with whatever level and then and you know being able to um a lot of money available to round them up\nAnd when a lot more like worrying\n\n\nHold his cat and um but as we're figuring of those things out um I think to think about the issues that I'm ... raising here I'm doing about that that there's a ... in the wake of disaster there's a lot of problems um\nBetween different levels of government for the state government um federal government local governments and with that um the ability for in the longer term and the recovery process for citizens to participate um is something that hasn't really fully been prioritized and\nMaybe it's a matter of expediency maybe it's a matter of um you know whoever can do this quickly the in the quickest option but um yeah that was one thing that he can be to us I'm as we were speaking to him that\nThe notion of citizen participation which seems to be so key in a place that has seized a lot of issues and problems with neglectful and incompetent governments\nAt all levels the federal level at the local level um [noise] I think that was a little bit um what\nWasn't shocking to hear because we already were aware of that fact um [noise] it's something that I think is troubling I'm definitely when people on the island um given his territorial son has given it's sort of status as a as a nearly colonial place um\nThe fact that people aren't able to sort of determine their own kinds of futures um in local planning processes within disaster recovery I think is something that I'm going to be really important in the long term\nHowever art music and communities pieces had been really important enough help provide a sense of healing and solidarity after the hurricane I'm Felix Rodrigues um the other person that we spoke to is one of the owners of a low cause a ... or do it yourself community

I'll probably take this down tomorrow and [laughter]\nIt's not there anymore but I happened to happen to spot it and I grabbed it while it was a while it was barren available for free download so I'm there you go crack the red from boy racer um perhaps a song that perhaps he will make available against some time or maybe you want but I thought it was pretty good credit to read from the race or follow toys like desert\nOr their first single guns that my had originally came out in Nineteen eighty six and tropical storm also from Australia choice on his or her from Australia a and there's some

the pack and\nGermany's crazy crazy crazies there\nDestroy the allusions to pack their self titled\nUm Germany's fine of steaks I like to call them because they were sort of jumping on the bandwagon with the whole punk rock explosions and I I Know I've mentioned this before some of these speakers that would cash in on a not even cash in what am I saying that it's not like they made money off of

action songs after that so there are still in town out there and green fields or\nThe was at the root cellar I Believe uh so that's happening tonight and the scientists have moved on and it was so

next for the WNPR news department I hate to have the good evening\n[noise]\nYou\nKnow I don't\n\n\nSee they're friendly listener did you know about all the ways you can listen to WNPR\nIt's not just on the airwaves\nVisit our website at WNPR toward the stream of wives poor listen to the archives show for the past two weeks or download our Android app to get the same things on your smartphone [noise]\nDo androids halfway deal the views and opinions expressed on the phone program are those are the participants and not necessarily the staff and management at WNPR the technology Broadcasting Corporation or the Massachusetts Institute of technology can evenings and welcome to what's left [noise]\n\nFully and greed of those that are in power these old white men Republicans and the woman that enable them it's pretty shocking that this could be happening in our democracy today I think there's a that it's really important that with the me too movement time's up enough is enough\nThat women are finding their voices and they are finally speaking out and I think\nI'm just taking tactic from their play book when women get angry women aren't allowed to get angry if we get angry\nThen we're cultural and now apparently were called a mom so um they keep saying that they're talking about the Democrats but they're not talking about the Democrats are talking about over fifty one percent of the population of this country and that is the women of this country who have had enough\nAnd it really doesn't matter what they call us we're not stopping we're going to take back our legislatures across the country and we're going to win in twenty Eighteen and the anger is not going to go away and no matter how gleeful they are\nThey are the mom they act like the moms they actually had actually act like the mafia there's high rent and we're not going to put up with any longer we're going to put women in power\nAnd these these even though they've gerrymandered them and we're going to keep on keeping until we take this country back what we're seeing going on now is really more than just about women and sexual assault sexual harassment this is the backlash against our first black president\nSaid this is not just about women this is about racism and we have to be honest about that they may not be saying that right now but that that's a big piece of this is the racism\nThe white supremacy that's also going on the hatred in this country these people that are in power rightly right now are very very ugly people\n[noise]\nHave you on\nWhen you're going to be loaded\nHas died and then why do they do to your mom I come\nThat did you deal with the congressional\n\n[laughter]\nMaking a bomb they remember\nOne game and they can\nPicture that the big companies when she was in the world\nDid your mom I\n\n\nAbout that\n[laughter]\nAnd give\nJoke [laughter]\n[noise] but yeah\nAnd give\nThe game and that joke\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nBut I think part of what's going on here is that Democrats persistently miss identify what's important to the American people because we have ethics and what's right on our side persistently and are unable to communicate how our interests aligned with a broader American interests and a satisfactory matter\nAt all so for instance the predominant message coming out of the lab is believe what business\nLaudable for obvious reasons we all understand the extent to which sexual assault or grossly under reported under prosecuted and\nThey have a bilingual sound influenced by South American folk house Latin percussion and of course hip hop\nAnd um they have a new album coming out but this was I don't think it's going to be on the new album and I don't know but the new album is uh is is bilingual although I think it's mostly in Spanish I make a versus America took\nA car is what that's called and now they were upset is rebel the dot com but that's on what's called you mad just exactly about\nThey have the disease is the white capitalist patriarchy okay it's what's left indeed have his show and that is the scene and that you hear so thanks for joining us with that and a hope you you enjoyed that let's do another\nThing now this is a ... in the background the great company ...\nAnd his trio from oh way back in two thousand five album called spiritual unity usually wouldn't talk over this because tutu good I'm oh I'm Sorry when I said it was from two thousand five I meant\nThat was when it was released as a CD actually it was originally recorded in Nineteen sixty four [noise]\nFor sure Gary Peacock on base and Sonny Murray on percussion very lovely lovely stuff usually I wouldn't talk over it but hey I'm it's angry and so am I. [laughter] so ah the struggle for democracy continues\nAnd I'm as Greg palace says this is a couldn't be more crucial time for that struggle Greg palace to as you may know is a\nWell known investigative journalist I Would say he has worked for the BBC and oh lots of newspapers and so much\nUm [noise] oh the guardian written a lot for the guardian he also has worked with labor unions consumer advocacy groups is recorded a\nAll kinds of things he's written numerous books including a I think the most the most recent is a Spanish language version of the best democracy money\nI think also came out and twenty twelve\nAnd he's done a lot of work on um the voter rolls purging the voter rolls how Republicans in particular have been stealing back the rights of people to vote especially people's color\nAnd young people a palace been not actively involved in a following Chris\nCole back [noise] that's how it's pronounced the guy from Kansas and that has now in the in the Trump Administration purging voter rolls everywhere he goes now uh he talked with\nDennis Bernstein the host of a program called flash point which is a daily politically progressive investigative news and public\nAffairs program broadcast weekdays on KPFA Pacifica Radio station in Berkeley, California\nAnd broadcast us on Pacific as national feed and we'll have a little excerpt now from that from last Wednesday October third Greg palace talking about um\nSpecifically focusing in on the state of Georgia and um the Republicans trying to discern read disenfranchise black voters in Georgia so let's hear some from Greg palace and\nInterviewed by Dallas Bernstein and you're listening to WNPR in Cambridge\nThis couldn't be a more crucial struggle in Georgia we have the possibility of the first African American woman to be elected governor in Georgia so there's a lot at stake writes Stacey Abrams is an amazing candidates so the issue here is big Darren\nOh I should say two things one it was would be the ...\nAnd so that's historic also you should understand she's an unabashed\nA progressive Democrats you into the Democrat she is a a a left Democrat and proudly so and I'm\nCamp a is a and and so it's it's a and here's the thing she's slightly ahead in the poll it's almost a dead heat and so Kemp by removing one in ten voters\nTo understand the conflict there he's a secretary of state he gets to decide who vote where they vote how you vote and then he decides which ballots will be counted now you have to understand in the United states of America and in Georgia\nWhich I'm not sure it's the United states of America pretends to be but in Georgia they have a particular problem with tens of thousands of absentee and provisional ballots which are disqualified and thrown out each year the chance your belt will be disqualified\nIs nine hundred percent higher if you're black than if you're white and understand this is not Kris Kobach Kansas won the Republican primary there\nUh his opponent won but it basically want the ballot for his ... the sitting governor of Kansas and Kobach Kris Kobach of Kansas the secretary of state disqualified the governor's voter's ballot\nAnd thereby want the the guy running itself does qualify his opponent out that's what we're having a Georgia with this guy who\nSet up to do the same thing and he started by bleaching the voter rolls whiter than white and I should say I I Do go to both candidates I don't you know I I can give both candidates a chance to speak\nStacey Abrams to not try to get me arrested she did not manhandled me or push me away um she just looked over my evidence and actually she should be an investigative reporter 'cause she found something I hadn't\nShe said that looking at the list which were by the way created by Chris\nAnd she said they said these people have moved\nIts true some of them have look at your list Mr palace some have moved into Georgia not out of Georgia some of these people have moved\nInto Georgia we just so you know down is I check with the post office or not just check the post office we hired and no small expense the post office own experts to review\nThe uh the voter list of those purge for moving Adam and overwhelmingly\nThe vast vast majority of people who are still right there at their original voting address we just got calls from people move down the street and were removed which is illegal\n[noise] so how did I don't have the secretary of state who's running for governor justify\nDisqualifying over a half a million people and I I assume I'm correct in saying that they are mostly people who've colored people who'd be inclined towards a supporting the Democratic candidates in this case a six string ordinary a woman Stacey Abrams you choose the yellow educated lawyer in a house minority leader there in the states\nNow now I'm not endorsing candidates I must tell I everyone should be allowed to vote in any white or black or other but it's true they the methods that they're using target black people a lot of things that they and and and the other group the other demographic they really get young people hard and then new\nNew Georgians people coming in from out of state moving in to the states\nAnd um that the New Georgia voter Georgia is the only state in the south where the polls are saying that\nGeorge in favor Democrats over Republicans are it is a you know so it's a very very different state um Georgia is becoming the first state in America where white people are the might of the first state in the ... in southeast\nIt scared and so they're removing young voters voters of color and Asian Americans are being hit really really hard in Georgia and in fact that's one of the things in my film the best democracy might buy\nI actually there's a part of the film called voting Gangnam Style and it's about ... young Korean Americans trying to convince their parents to register and vote and uh and the ... and Republicans used to love the Asian Americans because they voted mostly\nA Republican now they vote Seventy five percent Democrat and rising in other words the voters if they've turned black and in my film I illustrate that the kids are voting Gangnam Style and suddenly pop pop pop the turn African American and there is John Lewis a dancing gang style\nSaying votes Gangnam Style and I'm the only place you're ever going to see John Lewis dancing Gangnam Style I guarantee you but that's what's happening Georgia going after the Asian American vote in the young Asian American vote 'em so at one of the things that they did that I caught them doing\nAt one of the saddest thing there was a group called ten thousand ten thousand Koreans vote and they were registering ten thousand Korean Americans and\nIf they could replace\nThe machines because Detroit is occupied territory the people voted their Marin County supervisor but it's controlled under a bankruptcy a management operation by Republican governor\nSo the so whatever the mayor or the county and the elected officials walk and say is necessary Republican said no because the Republicans aren't going to fix clothing machines in Detroit\nBecause they know if you don't fix those machine the votes or loss and get through it that's what happened that was not the Russian the Russians did not purge half a million voters the Georgia ruled the Russians did not remove people in Indiana using the races cross check with\nThe Russians didn't create Kris Kobach cross check with\nIt is a white supremacist wing of the Republican Party willing to use race as a way to basically\nSteal elections that's what's\nIn Moscow playing with his with his Atari\nOr the Republicans do exactly how to shoplift the vote at least eight or short\nFor just that reads in twenty six states so I say summer are are coming out with their hands up a habit it once I got kind of a funny story\nI yesterday I we Indiana and all these states by the way are are dropping like flies because the biggest ... eighty nine day of Ninety Days or the legal requirement we have to get them Ninety Days before we go to federal court lady I date each state they're coughing up their files Indiana\nUh we uh our investigators asked the officials in Indiana cheat seemed like we have a lot of people who have been removed by um uh excessive use of the cross checklist they said\nAn individual or that we all it officially thought oh my God that's correct it looks to us like some of the counties are violating a federal court injunction at that you can't use the cross checklist in a federal court and jump ship\nAnd yet we have they handed over the evidence or even admitted it that we have all these people who are using the Kris Kobach just you know ... you know white cheat operation a and they admit that oh my God people are violating the federal court or\nI Want to let people listening to flash points on Pacifica Radio that's great talents to stay
