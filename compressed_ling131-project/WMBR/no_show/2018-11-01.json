look I'm all in favor of flexibility I think businesses should have some flexibility [noise]\nUm but that's not an excuse for not bargaining in good faith and not thinking about the uh the needs of your workers which is not\nNecessary for most big corporations um a including hospitals unless they're ... unless they're forced to\nOn the other hand I'm not sure it's such a good idea to tie a tie the hands of the hospital administrations in this way again this should have been taken care of through collective bargaining in my opinion\nBut I I Am going to vote yes on the nurse question on I ... on one I Am going to vote yes on one and if there are if there are um problems issues bugs in in this ballot referendum [noise]\nAh I I I think the legislature can ah can can make changes I think the legislature can tweak it now does our legislature have a great track record in a tweaking ballot referendum knew\nThe uh the recreational marijuana question is a perfect example we're still waiting you know ... ... still picking and uh we only we only passed that uh two years ago\nOr took four years for medicinal marijuana dispensaries to get up and running so this is likely to be quicker than that it's still slow as molasses is\nYes across the board including yes on question one it really bothers me that the big hospital associations are in their advertising and their advertising has has been having an ... an impact in effect\nAh when ah when the question was announced actually yes on one was um I think was polling better than no and now it's losing the yes\nFolks are the nurses are and their union is losing ground and are they the the millions of dollars being spent you know the millions of dollars being spent from by the hospital associations and their supporters or could have been used to hire more nurses\nOr could have been used to take some of the a patient burden off of nurses well what really bothers me is that the way that the no on one forces are framing this as\nAs um you know our children will never again be safe in a hospital and people are going to die in emergency rooms are going to fill up\nAnd uh the ground is going to open up and be a result Bob will reach up with his with his demonic hand and pull us down into the bowels of the earth no no\nI mean where did the hospital with it seems as though the um the uh hospital lobbying groups are taking a page right out of a our commander in chiefs of a book of out of of lies and miss truth [noise]\nUm on on the again on the other hand uh I don't I think the ... really should've been done at the bargaining table but uh\nThe uh the nurses that just have not been able to get the hospitals are too it seems to me and my observation they've not been able to get the hospitals to bargain a properly bargain in good faith\nAppears will be re electing Senator Warren [noise] ah I think that is a good thing I'm I'm not a big fan of Jeff deal nor the independent running a sheep or a or you do are are are you do or die or you do write you a\nUm I I saw his boss his bus parked knots of a few blocks from my wife's office in Cambridge with the big um I'm a real Indian and she's a fake Indian banner\nThat um that is plastered across the bus I'm not a big fan of his I'm not a big fan of uh of of of Trump deal I mean Jeff deal [noise]\nUh but I I disagreed I disagreed with a with Elizabeth Warren Senator Warren for saying anything about considering a run in twenty twenty for president\nUm 'cause I Do think you you ... you would least have to give lip service to being or senator first\nIn a presidential aspirin second on the other hand I don't have any problem with the ambition to be president I don't know why the hell anybody would want that job but we will eventually have a a a woman president I'm not I'm not sure it's going to be Elizabeth Warren though\nMight be I on Presley in Twenty years who knows\nMaybe\nAnd good luck to her because she's a running on a post or in the general election so good luck to her in a in the house of representatives and I hope she does a good job and I hope she does as good a job as a as a copy one wasn't a bad\nOr a\nCongressman not at all and uh what else there is a um Suffolk County district attorney of course\nSo is running a for that office I I think I uh I I I think I Would approve if she wins that election not that she needs my uh my approval but um\n[noise]\nWhat else uh there's got to be out of there there there's got to be other races oh well we got this uh this little little thing called the ... the gubernatorial election speaking of the governor\n[noise]\nSo I'm going to read a little bit from a Sandra story who used to own the Jamaica Plain gets at\n'em and she sold the paper to a ... a small um a a ... a small regional newspaper business but the Jay peak is that is the paper of record of my neighborhood in Jamaica Plain Sandra story as a special correspondent\nOr to the cars that are so she occasionally writes a opinion editorial pieces\nAnd back in August I'm Sorry I haven't spoken about this before but uh back in August she wrote about governor Baker twice rejecting giving poor families benefits for newborns\nI Know he's popular but when you go into it and I know and I and I imagine you don't know a lot about Jay Gonzales but when you go into the booth next week [noise] think about this\nSandra Sandra story writes quote unquote Charlie Baker is a great governor one ad for him this month begins with a woman saying that\nHe is running for a second term and his ads are flooding the local TV stations this month a head of the September fourth primary the of course he won his price\nI mean grin from him the ad repeats what has become a major media ... the past two years Baker is popular\nIn his recent handling of the two thousand Nineteen appropriations bill the Republican governors behavior toward poor family in the commonwealth was definitely not great to put it mildly\nThe trouble started late in the work day on Thursday July twenty seven when Baker unexpectedly vetoed the repeal of what's been called the cap on kids where the family kept in the two thousand Nineteen state budget\nTwenty three year old law the legislature voted to repeal says babies born the family's already receiving aid a transitional aid to families with dependent children for instance\nCannot receive additional aid\nThe repeal of the cap on kids endorsed by a coalition of a hundred and twenty two organizations and more than eight members of the house alone had passed the house and Senate and their conference committee on the appropriations bill the week before\nOkay so the legislature had only three days to override bakers veto before the session and somewhat difficult but doable as it was with some other line item veto is\nUnfortunately with this one item Baker turn what would normally just be hard to accomplish into something almost impossible [noise] some people at the state house perhaps including him at first thought the legislature would never be able to overcome the tricks he pulled\nBaker attached what was called a poison pill to the language surrounding the Capra repeal repeal he added that adults receiving transitional aide who receive Social Security for it\nMm\n\n[noise]\n\n\nRoger annoying\nTheir regular sight people\nThese musicians but I guess there's a lot of\nThey call themselves rather large\nAnd track called they called him blue\nAnd now we're listening underneath we can snap our fingers were listening to part three a little bit under the [noise]\nAll right uh let's see\nUh next week's election and are taking a look at a sort of the national picture when it turned our attention to Georgia [noise]\n\nAnd a number of um [noise] George or voters are are upset a number of people are upset at the secretary of state in Georgia Brian Kemp who is a running for governor\nAnd a is running for governor against Democrats Stacey Abrams I Believe she would become the first African American female governor uh I'm In Georgia\nAnd uh this this uh Brian Kemp is being accused of\nAwful terrible vote purging hundreds of thousands of people\nA purge dropped the voter rolls by sending to their house postcards that look an awful lot like ... or ... um spam ... you know spam mail that you do you just look at briefly and throw away and if the postcards don't come back\nUm these people are not being notified but they are being removed from from the voter registration rolls which means when they show up\nThey they are told they can't vote hundreds of thousands of people and this is not new this is that this is trickery that has been going on for a for quite a long time um you know it it it it uh historically has a precedent\nIn a in the um the uh\nStrategies used by yes Democrats to keep a to keep a blacks from voting you know in the deep south and uh and and now it's uh it it it's based\n[noise] I'm Greg palace to someone who has been a tirelessly or studying or a voter suppression or it just more than just that he writes about it he's created movies about it\nA and he's actually part of a lawsuit against Brian Kemp or in Georgia of it's about a seven and a half minutes long we're going to we're going to see a clip of a video\nFeaturing Greg palace talking about a voter suppression in Georgia
