University in Russia and originally\nWe just worked with Russia sending students to this country for internships or to do research but now we are low wing or into a larger him and she had to that's why right\nNow we call ourselves am I to Russia annual racially because not only a work with a Russian partners let's we also work with um\nDifferent goals for the states are like Georgia Kazakhstan are trying to help them I teach students a Gatz professional experience I'm working with this country and then also tried to connect these countries with MIT\nFor somebody to your spirits whose lives are going to have\nGone to these parts of the world so I think that um\nRussia well of course I'm biased I Am from Russia [laughter] um but I think that this is a one of the most fascinating parts of the world and Russia it's a one of the most interesting countries and right now with the um\nThe it's a difficult political situation and the old so um is an important country to know and especially if you are an engineer I'm for it or search or a scientist she'll someone who uh fees that passion shall for\nHerself working with global partners I think is very important ah to experience um\nThis country or these parts of the world because what\nI'm drawn education in science and technology and that's why I think that's where my students is very important to try to a Scottish connections there and I'm a potential need to find a lifelong friends\nWhat are the area of science and technology ah that are really causing a lead in their fields and I think it was part of the world\nSo I think that um there are a lot of\nUm a memory as we are a Russians meeting in terms of its fundamental approach to science of course everyone knows about Russian within additions and physicists or but at the same time Russia also approaches um\nSome maybe a research topics from a very unique perspective and you're a\nYou know as um Everytime I read reports that our students needed I see that they mention some\nTopics of their research and they say I was studying this or approaching this from one end goal within my tea and then coming to Russia I just realized that there is a completely different approach to this topic which helps me and my research\nTold me about some of the Pacific program or in some of the post Soviet countries or you're worth\nSo we um in addition to our internships out we also\nSand MIT students um on global ... labs and we work with schools in Kazakhstan and in Russia in ... we actually have um\nMore partners than in Russia because um Kazakhstan is investing a lot and I in their education\nOh I like him to us and a lot of force of us are excited to have a right to students who can teach hands on work shops\nAnd Daniels who work with the George yeah ah with the Georgia is a innovations acknowledged agency and they prepare and to pre Morris uh in various disciplines and they are eager to have and I teach students who also can share um you know some\n... Mm\nYou know\nA guy on the no\nNo I was like whoa\nWhoa whoa\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa\nWhoa something on my own\nFamily or not but I don't really know oh\nWell now online\nNa na na na na\nNa na na na na na na na and there's a\nThere's a lot of money you know uh\n\nOn a day or so on and on and so\nTo go online and you say you know\nI'm a I'm\nA I'm On my you know a hundred dollars a\nDay or a you know I'm\nA I'm a ritual on the\nPhone now going on and on the line there you go\n\n\nTo a guy the guy that they are they going\nTo be a\nVery nice you know now now\nYou know a lot of pressure on\nI'm going down down down down\nDown down here I don't\nHave you on a bomb on my bike on the line\n[noise]\nOh All right and that was some Georgian choral music this is why I miss the radio and WNPR so amazing 'cause you could just turn on your radio down here in Georgia and choral music uh so uh earlier when I interviewed conscious you had mentioned some new programs\nAnd Georgia so I went to my hat there to the traditional music of Georgia\nI'm so now I'm In a moment you'll hear my interview with Alex nap he spent\nA this past summer in Russia I'm working on robots actually and so you're about to hear more about that and again excuse me for the quality of this recording it should be fine um but it is a little bit less than ideal I'm so thank you for staying tune\nA this is W. MBR Cambridge\nRight I'm here with Alex Alex aren't you a health a bit more about what you did over the summer\nAll right uh so yeah this summer I spent eleven weeks in Russia or just outside of Moscow sounds ... I was working at school that University School of the Institute of technology\nA and I was doing some robotics well is there a chance to explore the city kind of meeting new people in ... in the culture and listen to the language practices you know shopping or talking to people just randomly\nTrying to figure out how to get to the airport in how to get back to the airport so I got a lot of practice there is a lot sounds really cool and\nUh ... what is your or a major where are you from maybe also what attracted you to go to Russia and France\nAt MIT I'm studying aerospace engineering um and then I concentrated in Russian language and the reason I started taking Russian in the first places it's kind of funny I guess I'm I I knew that my my grandfather on my mom's side uh\nIs either from Russia or Ukraine or somewhere in Soviet Union like his family line comes from that um and then also in my dad's side there were some Italian heritage and so when I was younger I always thought\nOh I'm a quarter Italian and a quarter Russian energy so cool to learn these languages and honestly had no\nReason to learn them besides that uh but I I remember I took Italian for a few years in high school and enjoyed it I liked learning a new language and so when I got here and saw that might be offered Russian I thought why not it's cool language to learn I get to learn a new also that\nUm it's something that I wouldn't see every day so I thought it'd be great experience and I I took a class so variety here really enjoyed it\nSo I continued within I've decided yeah cuts opportunity to actually practices language that learning to test for years in that actual country as well as just kind of meet people from across the world which is something I've always been a fan of so but how is your Russian how honestly\nProbably a lot worse [laughter] worse yeah running well also I've been back for what now two month yeah yeah and I I haven't had time to do any Russians since I got back from parents um unfortunately it just you know I'm Out of MIT classes in Russia and uh\nIt just doesn't go past Russian for and I don't have time for take extra classes Harvard at the moment so maybe later in life I Would like to go back to it and get a little better at it but as of right now it's starting to decline unfortunate\nBut when you were there were you working almost exclusively in Russian or whether they're laughing when I was\nThey're um they're required to present and stuff in English and their classes interest which is yeah it's pretty impressive if you ask me I got it and it's mostly Russian students yeah there's a lot of Russian students there's definitely some international students but they're they're pretty solid in English so I Would practice occasionally\nBut I don't know if I'd questions about work stuff that I wouldn't really know how to say Russian usually talk to them about it I mean Bush so I got a great and ah do you have like a favor Russian proper or anything like we're saying I don't I don't know if I have a\nFavorite saying I mean there is definitely some fun words like there are there worked for famous sites\nAnd I'm probably going to push it 'cause I don't know if I remember it completely but it had like ten syllables and dust a three month jump from the tea or something like that I mean the same effect but I I always found that were kind of funny 'cause it's like twenty five letters right to say something can sitting rush hour so all of their words in general\nOr or longer though when you're learning is the language it's a lot of trying to pronounce ... syllables or knowing which still does he should not be pronounced thing and trying not to like stumble over the work that those are sometimes I'm so let's talk about like what specifically works on\nWhen you were there at school I got 'em you give us like a little bit of an overview mhm so\nThat's a lot more that I worked at a they had a bunch of different programs projects going on a one of the main things that they worked on every year was a competition called ...\nAnd it's called your about but it's open to the entire world uh I don't think us generally has teams competing in it but basically every year they come up with some sort of competition and the job of these teams is designed robots that wall of autonomy asleep complete these tasks\nBush in competition with the national upset or so they had to robots that they had built and they're just kind of like are just like a cute basically to drive around and do stuff all kinds of stuff what they do\nSurprise you that sort of cut you off guard um\nWell besides the amount of trouble I had getting from the airport to my apartment when I first arrived and the amount of trouble that I had getting from my apartment back to therefore when I was trying to leave things weren't made like they went pretty smoothly or some of the the weirdest the cultural things that I\nWasn't expecting that are just like just slightly different but it's kind of throw you off and you know expecting it uh\nIs when you say Hi to someone in the morning you kind of shake their hand like\nNot when you're first meeting someone which is more common here but like oh hey good morning you shake their hands and it's like the way of saying hello\nUh that was like you know it's fairly different it's not that weird but it's something that I caught me off guard I wasn't expecting it um\nI I remember so before I left a I'd learn some you know Russian culture growing my my classes here and some of the superstitions if they had it and I remember thinking or they're they're kind of odd\nUm you know they all superstitions are at some points a little weird\nYou know you never really know where they come from and so I remember\nI think maybe it was like first week there I was asking someone else in my life was like hey so I was told about the superstitions because I thought there they're kind of interesting like\nIs this something that you guys think about it and they're like oh not really I don't know so it was just like the things I was expecting to be different weren't really necessarily and maybe that's because of where I was um\nI also remember being told that you know things had been slightly more\nI don't know what the word is that since the world cup was there they had prepared I guess for a lot of tourists to be there and so it was probably a lot easier to get around as someone who wasn't a native Russian speakers and it had been in the past whether it was very for their regular signs and the fact that I I I went there expecting to only see sterility\nAnd those translations I didn't expect that whatsoever over here so they definitely some of that I think was preparation for tourists from the world cup and some of it might just be that they're they have a little bit of English floating around as it is\nIt almost sounds like what was surprising to you is that uh you weren't that surprised [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] yeah and so I traveled before and I come to the realization that you know usually going expecting things to be very different and then\nThey're usually not for pretty much people across the world right um but I wasn't sure I'd never been to Russia and you know that's a bit more foreign I guess than some other countries in Europe uh that I've been to so\nWasn't sure what to expect and I I Know during the meeting so we had before and they were like hey these are some things that you should expect that might be\nDifferent and then I think when I actually went there it wasn't that different which is what I've come to expect but\nThough as somebody who has some Russian Russia and Trump ancestry they did it was it at all meaningful you to be there to connect to anything any particular way are so anything strike you as like you were somehow part of your family background\nSo yeah I guess with the story I told her earlier about that it's it's not like it's been a huge part of my life I guess like my grandfather doesn't speak Russian [noise] um he wasn't he never lived there either uh so for me it was just kind of a oh this is kind of interesting things like it it was never really like\nA a thing for me like this is part of my family heritage or anything like that it's not it's never really had thought about it it was more of just a oh well I can learn a language and why not learned the ones that get my family when they got a long time ago um\nBut you know when I was there it was more of just for me at\nLeast when I travel is more about the people I get to meet them\nThey don't even know I I I Know my grandfather said he was maybe one of his parents just from Ukraine with us from Russia and I would assume maybe Moscow or St Petersburg or something just because the big cities right out of the year so you were there a\nYou know when there's as there has been a lot of talk about how there was Russian interference in the U.S election I'm curious if that if you encounter those news stories um\nAnd just generally how the media was portraying the current tension between\nUs and Russia from the perspective of an American consuming local\nYes there so I guess I I kind of wish I had done more of that I didn't really watch the news to Montreal is there or anything like that um but the perspective I got was you know interacting with other people there are\nAnd I think that the overwhelming thing that I got from\nThe Russian people that are meant that met there was that they didn't care that I was American like it wasn't it didn't matter to them or something I I tend to learn or at least it's a it spends on the person but I Know before I left you know I get questions like oh are you going to Russia like [laughter] I'm\nSure you want to go through our enemy out of the great right yeah\nSo I think the thing that I learned just and maybe this isn't true across the board but uh what they would like to say that Russians do a better job of separating between politics and then just like you know normal people today if they realize that\nYou have maybe I'm not a politician not someone who like me myself I'm not an enemy of Russia even is maybe our countries themselves don't get along Super Bowl so whereas you know before I left people like hey why are you going to Russia people that are like oh cool you're from the U.S like\nIt's just you're just another person [laughter] yeah I think they do a good job of there\nYou don't have any any day now so I don't know maybe I wasn't looking at all or is that people just didn't really talk about it\nWhether major news story in Russia that were happening while you were there that you got on your radar\nSo there were small things like I had had in my sewn some international alerts service that would tell me hey something's happening and you know occasionally I see something like don't go to this place at this time and it was like okay it's kind of just didn't go there but it didn't take too much attention to it so\nI I kinda I guess in a way stick my head and stand with his photo news kind of goes ah I of course enjoyed the votes causing followed that but as far as you know international stuff I never I very much of a political sort of yeah area yeah yeah I wanted to separate myself from the United states\nBut it is funny because you did hear more about that on this end yes yeah for sure and what about when he came back did you hear you saying like how I'm asking you about other people ask you about it as well\nA little bit yeah I mean I think at that point people are more interested in just like oh how was this the the tricks and what kinds of stuff that you do and you know I I got a few questions but nothing like I mean obviously I didn't have a ton of answers either so in some get too far with it yeah\nUm is there anything else about Russian culture that he found to be really interesting or exciting maybe the food or anything related to that so I didn't really enjoy Russian food apparently Russians themselves don't super enjoy Russian food it can be blended time after um\nThey like their their uh their version of ketchup is sour cream and like the cream on everything and it was okay with that [laughter] the out that um so\nYeah interestingly enough I remember I was walking around the city but it's one of my friends is a lot like the first week that I was there and I kind of want it to trial for Russian seats on that depression foods and at one point he was like hey you Andrea\nCan you get like when you get a\nFries at McDonald's in Russia does become a sour cream or I don't get I think of it I did it but\nLike it was the same as if I went to the right here I heard the largest McDonald's in the world of Moscow really yeah I wouldn't be surprised like\nHas like a roller sixteen register [laughter] and when you walk into the counter yeah I I seem to notice Donaldson foreign countries that definitely nicer than they are here right but if you don't like Donald and they take 'em or yeah a little bit [laughter] yeah\nWhat other Russian food for you so yeah so some of the my favorite\nThings are there are ... which are like kind of fried cheese in a way a fried farmers can use a those are super good are they put Supreme as you may have guessed by now and jelly on them [noise] those are the two common like talking there was a super good um\nWhat else is there a little meat is currently the direct translations pancakes meter crepes more or less the same thing um they like to eat it usually like\nPut something within invented a role in love with something inside so you can have some with me you can have vegetables and then start training them um those are pretty good\nUh a lot of their salads are kind of like what we think of just like to take us out the good news and potatoes or stuff like that and ... and so I guess\nA lot of the streets are kind of\nI don't know how to describe it they have a certain kinds of taste that seems to be\nYou nice depression is real but so he's\nLearned more a depression is real dot org [noise]\nSupported by

we're getting all the way to the to the end and I made quite a trip to mix it down um my contributions consist of areas of my expertise\nA keyboard playing into inside the canals sort of stuff which I picked up a couple of tricks from a John Cage and his coterie\nYeah well you have a moment let's hear a little bit of the examples of you're doing that from and some of the sun which unlike a ox ... did come out on CD and it's um\nOriginal version and a week and I'm here some of that although\nYeah OK I'm [laughter] oh I I'm just having a weird issue here maybe we won't hear some of us um what's the oh yeah let's see what we have here\nYou know this sounds like it's nothing else done [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nI was insulated you might say yeah and I I probably the best time of everyone and also the stage was kind of a rickety will read it that are coming down fill it was ... not a headline an extra a huge rock and roll disaster underage named\n... well you know the band is always kind of I'm paying their performance there but I've listened to it and it's not that bad [laughter] it really was pretty well yeah yeah there is the name of it too\nYeah yeah it's it's out there um [noise]\nSo um you know you you kept on a\nA performing with them for a quite a while and in through the uh he's Nineteen Seventy and uh your last appearance was in April Nineteen Seventy one with the band the Fillmore east and those funds shows are are represented on a CD so called ladies and gentlemen the Grateful Dead and um [noise]\nSo uh you're um current project that you're with is a a a great aggregation called lived and writers sixty nine and a we're really glad to have you for the electric Halloween ball at the Wilbur theater in Boston on Wednesday night and um\nDo you mind grateful that I knew why does the purple sage music or I think I saw the group once before doing the live dead album song for song but that's not the itinerary this time [noise]\nBut we moved on it it's like you know the ... the thing that they were particular ... at the kicked in our shows settlers to do that but now they moved on\nAnd we realized we couldn't just do that over and over and over again you can look at pretty much did that in Nineteen sixty nine [noise] but the difference but this is our approach to music that district the material is organic we do it from the inside none of us learned these songs from us song book\nRight right yeah and they didn't originally either [laughter] yeah\nSome of them some of us never did actually yes\nAnd I'm just a great lineup of musicians or mark Karen who uh played with Bob wears rap dog but he also has a resume with many other artists including a Dave nice in human ... and um he's a\nUm he can just do all kinds of sounds and uh I'm a very intuitive guitarist and I've always been a fan of his I've interviewed him\nAnd I'm Robyn Sylvester ... also from Bob here's rat dogs on base and uh\nHe's just one of these ... unassuming guys who doesn't seem like he um doesn't you know really promotes his past but he's played with a he's backed up the beach boys right coot or the leak Marty bailing a Motown an R. and B. acts like Mary Wells in the ... the coasters the drifters belly Preston ...\nUh he's got quite a a resume and um he's a\nOn base with you guys and he was with a Bob here's rap dog and\nYou know I Know that Bob we're um\nPut a lot of these old too old or tunes or through their paces with these newer guys and so they learned the material really well and ah from what you've been posting um you really have\nFreedom because we're not none of us is trying to be someone else around you know who we are we got the trail from the inside and we are testifying as we have learned\nYeah and also the uh the technology is there to give a much ... more more fair balance to your keyboards and then that might have been a over forty years ago forty five years ago which I definitely appreciate yes\nYeah yeah that was unfortunately part of the uh the issue with the dead was I'm going I actually have found the Grateful Dead ends in Nineteen sixty nine Halloween Night concert on line and we'll play some of that or they were at San jose State University you were there you can be heard\nBut it's I'm really unfortunately in the mix kind of thin and ah [noise]\nAh so it's going to be really great to you know it's really too bad they didn't have the technology or that they have nowadays for making that getting that kind of criminal balance between keyboards and guitars and so forth [noise] ah so I guess\nI I finally found a new comfort zone and it's a as a name implied quite comfortable\nYeah All right um\nWell ah and\nAlso in the band I Do want to mention a slick Aguilar who was performed with the Jefferson Starship for many years in the recent decades and he's joining a mark a current on guitar and ah as they have a real a really a great dynamic together I'm also a Oh yes yeah\nAnd also the ah I'm more of the Grateful Dead family musicians are on drums is a joke charcoal from the ... gene God so God show band in the long time a New York jam band on his ... and my closet Renault who I who was played live on the show before back in the year two thousand when he was with\nYou on a coconut and Pete Sears the three of them played light on the show or my show LA and um he's a great guy\nBe a kind of leading a new writers opening set in the style of the way that they open for the dead back in the late Nineteen sixty nine era so that'll\nI remember some of those shows sickly yes\nYeah and those are just great tunes too so this will be a lot of fun and um [noise] uh this'll be at the Weber theater in Boston on a Halloween Night and um let me see if I can find the\nUh the time here on earth well I'll find that in a moment here got too many too many windows open on the computer at once [laughter] yeah\nWell I I'm the last one to ask they just deliver main points to the station say it's time\nYeah um okay no I found it it's a these shows that eight pm on Wednesday night until eleven PM and um\nYou know there's a there's a also were really um on Wednesday nights as a a really high energy a Grateful Dead jam band that uh but has propped up in the past couple of years here called barely dead I'm\nYou know probably an absurd thing dimension but if you're not too tired out after ... after the gig maybe I'd bring your to check them out they play every Wednesday night I'm there wouldn't be a yeah a\nLittle ... they go till twelve thirty so are the people that you see the show could probably make the end of the show too but I Will be giving away some tickets to this and this is just going to be really great um [noise]\nRight uh so I don't want to overstate I Know that are are you you're in between um a given your son ... is that what was happening [noise]\nOh yeah well actually it's the ... the last couple of days before I had out right away it it will bear fruit Wednesday ... sure\nI Want to mention they'll also to our listeners to the north of Boston that ah the tourists coming on Thursday night also to the to blow music call up and down\nTrue exactly alike anyway so we'll we'll ... it up and go out again from a different angle yeah every night\nAnd and what would you think about this I mean I I um [noise] I said mentioned this before is that was just mentioning one of the dead cover bands\nIf forty years ago somebody told me that there would be over a dozen Grateful Dead cover bands just in the greater Boston eastern Massachusetts area alone in twenty eight team it would've blown my mind um [laughter]\nUm I mean I knew of only one back then you probably I Would think of them are worked with them they became an original band called max creek\nBut uh oh yeah yeah they were doing dead covers when they first started out about forty years ago when uh I don't really think anyone else much was but now I mean you can go and see live did music in various clubs almost every week night of certain weeks in this area it's just amazing um\nTo imagine art to believe\nYeah [laughter] I don't know if you have any ah um comment on that phenomenon um as I don't mean to put you on the spot but\nIt's it's a testament to the material yes that keeps on tour right\n[noise] yeah that's what it is and it's a really what they've tried to accomplish a and try to achieve in communicating to people musically and lyrical early and spiritually over the years sometimes they fell short of accomplishing that but it didn't matter at all with sounded great in with a lot of fun I'm real started way [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nRight oh I didn't mean to just to cover bands ... they're pretty much I couldn't I met the dead themselves occasionally they Oh yes yeah occasionally they felt laughed but the I mean I saw about\nNot as many as a lot of people I Know maybe fifty eight Grateful Dead shows in a jury lifetime in a in some amazing transcendent won some really blown blowing away ones and a few that were kind of clunkers in yet yeah that was the way it was um [noise]\nBut um yeah unfortunately didn't get to see you with them I\nYou just miss playing live here at MIT to where they the dead played live here at MIT and may Seventy that was a guy an outdoor show 'em anyway [noise] um well great to have you with us today Tom and I don't want to take up too much more of your time and I want to thank you anything else you'd like to do with where we unlucky\n\nHave been to the movies with those stupid [noise] and they're going to\nBe able to play [noise]\n\nWhenever we're limited\n\n[noise]\nOkay that's a does continue to be pretty intense but uh I don't have a more room in the show for that\nThat was the other one that's it for the other one from um the Grateful Dead Nineteen sixty nine Halloween show at San jose State University in October thirty first Nineteen sixty nine a kind of a rod recording but I wanted to play basketball for the\n... keyboards you can hear them toward the end there from a coming through and once again congratulations for ticket winners who will be seeing Tom can stand to along with

was eight\nThat was how many sides the whispering how old are you guys have rack Chad in the song the eleven\nOkay let's move on to something else I'm speaking of Grateful Dead though Wednesday night as I mentioned the band barely dead plays every Wednesday nights at uh the thunder road club in Somerville great high energy band and um they just came out of nowhere a couple of years ago ... years ago and uh\nAnd um you could maybe even make it to you to the second half of their second set if you go to the Wilbur show to six one Seventy five three eighty eight ten for barely dead Wednesday night and speaking of that there are many ... bands playing around\nBecause this show I think it's either free or very low cover I don't have tickets for it\nBut the uncle Johnny's band who I play the midway cafe a tip you hours on early friday evenings are doing a Halloween show at Sally O'Brien's in Somerville on Tuesday night as well donor tickets for that one don't work as a cover charge or not

most\nEyes uncommon misunderstandings out this year from strong arm press she joins us now by phone from Maryland Welcome back to counter spend Nancy Altman\nThank you so much for having me\nWell let's start with what Mitch McConnell just said when the Senate Republican\nLeader was talking to Bloomberg on October sixteenth he\nCalled Social Security Medicare and Medicaid the real drivers of the debt\nAnd lamented both parties unwillingness to address or adjust them well some people must have thought did he accidentally say the quiet part loud and allowed part quiet you know Social Security is famously so popular that it's described as the third rail of us politics here he's saying\nShame if anything were to happen to it ah right before an election but if it was maybe brazen McConnell's claims are are in a long tradition thing\nYes and I think you really captured it perfectly in your introduction this is an ideological fight this was about values but the side that as opposed to Social Security\nPresident Dwight Eisenhower signed a letter to his brother described opponents for Social Security as negligible in under a tiny splinter group unfortunately that tiny splinter group now\nHolds rain over the Republican Party\nBut they understand the politics low enough to not say we think Social Security socialism we don't the government should be doing this they say oh we love it but it's driving the deficit the reality is that Social Security does not add a penny to the deficit it's totally self financed\nIt is an earned benefit that we all contribute to its gotta have a balanced budget and it always\nHas and no other but conservative president Ronald Reagan you can go on YouTube\nTo the deficit but this is a line that Mitch McConnell is using and I think it's you feeling defensive because of course their tax cuts\nTo millionaires and billionaires and big corporations blew a hole in the federal budget at one point five trillion dollars and now they're trying to look around and the ... it wasn't us that did it and so they were going after their favorite targets which they oppose on ideological grounds\nWell and they have something to work with because media I think have not done a terrific job of\nMaking so concretely clear the realities of Social Security Medicare and Medicaid that when you hear these Republican claims you can say oh wait I Know I Know that's wrong you know I think in fact media\nHave some active on telling a to do having spent decades kind of\nEnabling the story line you unpack and address the storyline in your book the truth about Social Security and I I Would really like to just walks through you've started to already but walk through some of the myth that seem just so difficult to dispel\nNo you're exactly right and let me before we get to them is talk about the role of the mainstream media because as I mentioned\nDwight Eisenhower called the opponents a tiny splinter group which is true but they have oversized influence right because they are literal billionaires I mean the obvious or the Koch brothers but there's another who died recently Peterson who spent before his death\nA billion dollars of his own wealth to spreading the lights about Social Security he was dedicated to this and set up a lot of organizations feel talked to various organizations committee for a responsible federal budget and all of these very independent objective but they've all been funded by the same group of that\nIncome you know they go to the same cocktail parties they bought into this fortunately the Democratic party has emerged and returned to its roots and see the light and they now are calling for expanding Social Security both Republicans are still saying we've got to save Social Security it's\nYou know it's we love it but we can't afford it and other nonsense like that which are some of them is what I think will be getting up\nTo absolutely I mean you know I was just going back to fares\nArchives on this and it's there's just no shortage I mean here we have NPR's Scott Simon this is two thousand for\nNo one would deny that Social Security is headed for a major crisis the crash in a sense has already been done because thanks to the baby boom there are fewer Americans paying into the system so\nThat is what sets up this idea of\nWhat is ultimately of course a goal of privatization being packaged as rescuing a system that same crisis\nExactly it's all the same rhetoric and let's billionaire funded campaign has been unsuccessful in actually cutting our cash benefits but it has been successful in a couple of ways one is that part of what Social Security is supposed to provide in addition\nTo wage replacement is a sense of peace of mind security its in its name the idea that if\nThe unimaginable happens and you become\nDisabled and could no longer work if you die prematurely leaving some children or if you were fortunate and live to old age you are secure in the knowledge that you have a benefit you've earned that will provide for you and your family and that's something we've all contributed to and paid for so we've lost that\nAnd the way that we've lost that is that you ask most Americans especially younger Americans if they think Social Security will be there for them and they say no and that's just wrong\nOver the next Seventy five year the end of the twenty first century there would still be enough revenue coming in to pay Seventy five cents on the dollar now that's not enough we want to have a hundred percent on the dollar but the idea that the program won't be there would take an act of Congress\nWill and I think media Austin oh Mitt that idea of government choice there is a sense of well nothing's going to be done and it's like a rock rolling down the hill when of course government makes adjustments to policies all the time and could certainly do so with Social Security\nWell and on that point and this is why this election coming up is so important as you've mentioned Mitch McConnell and Marco Rubio they've all said they they're going after Social Security Medicare and Medicaid they want to cut these programs\nAnd if they're saying this before the election they're just going to be emboldened they'll think they have a mandate after the election the flip of that\nIs that if the Democrats take the house\nThe person who will chair the Social Security subcommittee is representative John Larson of Connecticut who was introduced an expansion bill called the Social Security Twenty one hundred act which\nThat only expands benefits across the board has more accurate cost of living\nAdjustment increases the special minimum but fully pays for all of it\nThrough the end of the century which is why he calls it Twenty one hundred act and he has said that if\nHe gets the gamble he will hold hearings and start to push this legislation\nIn the new Congress so we will see action I think the reason Congress has not acted is that they've tried to do something the American people don't want the American people overwhelmingly oppose cuts to Social Security and that's what Republicans who have control in Congress want to do which is why there's been no action\nUh as affirming is actually performing at the Sinclair tonight uh and I will be dashing right to the venue dried after my show so uh we'll also be listening a hearing from some other clear artists including a new track from real vena\nAs well as a one of my all time favorites uh by Alix Leahy and\nAn Australian indie rocker um\nWill also be listening to some ...
