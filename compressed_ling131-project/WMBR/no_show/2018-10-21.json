with me I'm a bit of girls but I Want to say thank you why stock happy Tuesday\n\nHello WMBA our listeners this is Amy and we're back on we're all immigrants uh show based on racial identity and issues related to that I guess I'm today I'll be talking to eat and Garza\nHe sophomore here at MIT about his experiences with his racial identity um so\nFor the previous two interviews I had already talked to my interviewees previous handed kinda dumb like a pre screening at hadn't gotten a feel for um bits and pieces and maybe some major themes that they would talk about but\nFor eat then I actually haven't done any of that so this is I'm I'll be listening to story for the first time just as you guys all are and so it will be a different style of interview I guess but um you know here's hoping that it goes great and here's Ethan\nAudi high heat then um so I guess I don't even know what race are you I guess or what would you consider yourself to be\nThat's a really tough question only because I think my ethnicity is like I can almost fully like a hundred percent with confidence say that it is like Hispanic but I don't know what race I Would be classified as\nWhy do you say that like I guess maybe a more specific question is where are your parents from\nMy mother's from Mexico and my dad's from the U.S I see and I guess I'm like what\nYeah just white you know like um I don't know like what kind of heritage he has\nHis great grandma or his grandmother my great grandmother is from Mexico um and then my but his mother is how is it Europe descendent\nEuropean descent okay and do you know like from which area from Europe she's from no [laughter]\nUh she says she can use like from many from what I understand yeah\nAnd I know it's all good so I guess I'm so you felt you feel that you're Hispanic I guess I mean it sounds like most of your heritage comes from Mexico then did you grow up with um like celebrating Mexican holidays are you hearing to Mexican generation though I grew\nUp mostly which is a holiday celebrated it in the U.S I was aware a lot of like Mexican holidays and traditions\nI'm I there were\nVery few that I Would say that like I celebrated fully has they would in Mexico I guess\nMhm of course I mean he lives in the U.S though I mean do your parents Spanish at all my mother's fluent my father speaks a little ... and so do they speak Spanish to you while you're growing up\nAh my mother did a quite a bit because um when I was young my father was active duty military so it was mostly my ... my mother and I when I was younger and so like I had a lotta speak English\n[laughter] um I guess um how are you okay so I guess did you um growing up did you feel that you identified as like a Hispanic like when you were younger did you think like oh like I'm different from the other countries because I'm Hispanic\nLike race or ethnicity because I didn't really pick up on that kind of thing when I was younger instead since I kind of like spoke broken English and broken Spanish it was really tough for me in the public schooling system\nTo where teachers had special classes for me so that I can learn proper English [laughter] and I I I didn't know the reason why but that was it [laughter]\nMhm mhm and so at what age did you realize that oh you know I'm Hispanic you know that that makes me I guess different in a certain way\nUm I wouldn't say maybe until recently just because beforehand I Would just do it I Would normally do without a of like\nRace or ethnicity mhm and where are you from\nI'm from Texas so I may have been easier for me because a lot of people there are Hispanic yeah [laughter] and so like it wasn't so much as like being different due to race\nYeah you did interface right yes yeah and so how was that transition I guess for August could you tell us because people might not know what ... is a little bit briefly and then um I guess how that affected your understanding of your racial identity\nOf course I sew interface is a two year program sponsored by the only me\nAnd it's meant to help get students who may not have had the opportunity to be has ... prepared for MIT course work to get to that level to help us succeed as like students and potentially\nYeah and do you feel like it did change your MIT experience\nYes before coming here I had no idea what a factor was and I was very important thing to know so I'm very glad that I had that\nBest friend ... you also did interface with me and so that's where we met\n[laughter] yeah I'm I've met Clinton I think [laughter] but I guess I'm\nI guess so look from your your high school background I guess you didn't know that she was like what was your um high school or I guess how would you describe your high school environment\nHas far as like academically or yeah like academically\nIt was it it wasn't a bad school but I don't think it was really possible for me to get fundamental like a good fundamental understanding of more or less basic concepts\n[laughter] mhm I see an or\nUm how many Hispanic people were in your school it was like the ratio\nOf [laughter]\nMaybe somewhere in between thirty and fifty percent\nThat's actually quite a bit like almost half of them were Hispanic yeah so I guess you blended right anyway [laughter] there's probably a lot of a range of his many people will do so with that transition kind of weird to come to MIT where there maybe aren't as many Hispanic people especially there is there aren't as many Mexican be well I Would say\nA\nIt was it was it was cool I got to learn a lot more about different cultures rather than just reading about them or hearing about them I got to like experience them more or less like first hand mhm\nUm it did like helped me to see how different my background was from any other people's background and that's probably about it\nHim [laughter] yeah do people ever insinuate that you had gotten into MIT just because you were a minority I'm not too sure if\nOh how hard I worked to get to where I Am but I at least if they did either didn't catch on our wasn't there at least they didn't do it in front of me\n[laughter] mhm mhm\nYeah or I guess I guess you know there's a whole debate going on right now with affirmative action um Harvard I don't know if you've been following that is under um or you know a group of ah students and parents have filed a lawsuit against them saying that\nYou know um they discriminate against Asian Americans specifically and so therefore I guess they they want to dismantle affirmative action because they don't think it's fair and I guess what what are your feelings on the issue it's really\nThose dynamics you maybe I've seen in cocoa would definitely had\nA lot of that [laughter] oh yeah [laughter]\nYeah do you feel like that changed your guests them your outlook on life when you're growing up like that change the way you thought about things\nI'm kind of an in a sense that like I think about family more but other than that some details may seem frivolous to me yeah\nHow was it in this recent I was there for you in this recent political climate that is so well I mean there was always people who are like anti illegal immigrants against but\nJust recently it has taken I feel like a very dark turn and people are more openly racist I guess against just Mexicans in general and so I guess how\nHow was that for you and um oh my gosh [laughter] how was that for you and how did that affect you I guess\nIt just\nMade me sad that people I always say outspoken people weren't necessarily dealing things objectively\nUm\nConsideration into some things but mostly just maybe people attacking people who just because of the race not necessarily based off of actions mhm just because there were like\nA tax I don't I mean like verbal attacks at least on people who are just of Hispanic or Mexican\nHeritage for not even doing anything but being that yeah\nWhat's your stance I guess on um people from Mexico to immigrate here legally like do you think that's a problem do you think that we should close our borders you because you build a wall\nI think I Need to look more into some things before I have a formal opinion yeah\nUm I guess yeah\nUm what kind of things I think it's what you want to listen to look into\nWell a just a ... but his takes kind of thing\nUm I\nI don't think a big wall would be very effective honestly like weather like being for or against it I think there should be some other kind of solution but\n\nJust things that I don't feel well enough to have formed an opinion on\nYeah I'm from ... from Texas probably people like your high school may be more like\nI'm\nFrom like illegal immigrants were descended from illegal immigrants\nI'm\nProbably [laughter] and it also depends on like I guess how far back you want to go in and like everybody practically\n[laughter] show actually I don't know if we're all in business is really the best idle because\nPeople from like where I well yeah and I at least everybody's arguably\n[laughter] and I also feel like that overlooks the black American Experience because\nI wouldn't say black people immigrating here not necessarily or especially people who came like forcibly yet do the transatlantic slave trade or I wouldn't call that immigration is a family so sometimes I think that a better time would have been like no one is illegal in my opinion [laughter]\nSo um yes I I think we need to talk with on the shows I'm Glad I was able to fit it in such that you know I'm not look overlooking or I'm I'm not intending to overlook the Native American and black American experience\n[noise] but um yeah I guess what do you think it means to be an American\n\nWho [laughter] that's like a very tough question it's like um\n\nI think people who contribute to the country and have a deep sense of appreciation for it\nAlthough I think that's also probably generic to any country not necessarily in their ... went to the people who what could you ... over who like are strongly for their country\nLike contribute to it\nAnd I think I have like one more thing I forget what that was interesting why do you think you have to er okay so somebody who like kind of like nationalistic as I guess they're they're patriotic\nThey in a sense yeah interesting and um do you feel like you're an American\nIn a good way I'm a course things could always be better oh sorry I of course I I think things could always be better\nLike I'm starting from nothing that we've had progress [laughter] mhm and that's how I Would say I'm I'm pretty proud I'm happy to be here yeah yeah\nI Am happy to hear too I guess so um where are you going to play a song now so this is WNBA king um Dallas eat anywhere like take a break right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nMean this is what have you with us it's just one of my cousin lives down there when I used to watch him on like a photo of what you're saying that if\nOn to give any
