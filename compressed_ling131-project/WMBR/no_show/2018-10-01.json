rate of this is our first time doing misty radio misty is MIT international science and technology initiative\nAnd I'm going to be your host Ari Jay I'll be here every other Monday morning at seven AM I Hope\nYou can also join us going forward\nI'm so let me just touch on the premise of the show a little bit um so am I tease reaches global and this show is meant to be a platform for students to reflect on their experiences abroad and how they relate to issues of identity\nAnd broader global MIT challenges and so I think what I wanted to do is create an MIT program for the world about the world and today we're going to be talking about some of the work MIT does ah with Syrian refugees in Jordan and possibly more refugees hopefully as ah the program you're about to hear about expands\nAnd I am joined today starting out by a at near message and am I saying that correctly\nYes ... and David do lab\nUm who is my colleague at misty special guest for it today um so we're going to be talking about some of the work that they've started doing I'm I'm there can you just introduce yourself for our audience\n[laughter] so ah my name is a new message says you pronounced correctly [laughter] very much and uh uh I'm an assistant professor in ... and ... engineering a fellow at the\nYeah that might be and David\nWhat's your what's your how do you fit into all that well I'm a\nDirector and managing director of firms and are very excited to the professor a message for the Arab world alumni and ready to fight or make the world a better place to look at me or students credible global experience\nAll right and we'll we'll hear more from the students are they are or what is um what is react so\nTo react to that is a great opportunity for a displaced people all around the world that to um continue to start them continued their higher education it's a\nIt's an idea that started a couple of years ago when uh I joined MIT and realized\nHow um [noise] they can all a G impacted education or um globally and that and um and then are working with my colleagues here at MIT we started to develop but this idea of implementing some of these technological advancements in a\nIn a um you know helping a refugees to [noise]\nTo continue to education and I must say I'm ... the\nThe challenges is huge considering the the numbers that we are facing I don't know if you're familiar with them with those numbers but we are talking about yes we're talking about um Seventy million displaced ... today and then\n[noise] and this number is definitely gonna increase unfortunately and um and are being displaced is really I'm really a an a challenge or especially when it comes to higher education we are talking about\nOne percent of refugees are being able to at the end\nUm yeah so we we started a couple of years to go in thinking about it and a year\nOr two thousand Seventeen we found is really act that the advantage to solve a and M. and now what do you know okay so so is this a MIT initiative to um sold the greatest challenges of flower\nA society and that indeed or one of the first challenge as the sole launched a um avoids I'm challenged to deliver education to refugees around the world than I lead that challenge and that then this to work a\nThat was very valuable for me to to learn about um about um you know I'm tools and I'm\nA and the issues related to education for refugees and and yes and I'm at the event in may we launch react than we are excited or to um share this the first year of experience and the and also a continue working on this\nSo can you tell me about the emphasis\nBehind starting I Know there's some sort of personal connection here some reason you really want it to get a gun oh yeah I mean I'm I I was born in a ex Yugoslavia in the um ... and I lived in Boston the end and living in Boston nineties was not such a great ah\n[laughter] ah so ah unfortunately and you know you may be even fortunately [laughter] for my personal story I ended up in the refugee camp that discovered the Palin for science and math and a\nAnd a um [noise] you know a\nStarted or actively I'm focusing on education as the key of ah my success\nSo I'm from ... um where I basically become one of the best young twenty campus of the country I ended up studying in Italy through an NGO that helped me a starts university\nOr in terrain and yeah I got my degree and moved to Germany and eventually ended up here or there might be and\nWhen I entered the or are they might\nThe as I said I realize how a technology changed the in two decades send or how much should we didn't improve when it comes to a offering education for refugees and that was the main motivation for me to\nThen that focus or a efforts and some of the experience to be able to design a you know specifically to the um programs that that will address that challenging issue when\nYou were students are in the refugee camp what was your access to education like\n[laughter] yeah oh I can tell you something that they learn this summer I visited my uh my uh high school professors in Croatia\nAnd they told me um they told me or something that I didn't know so um [noise]\nBasically I was not allowed to go to school in ... as a Bosnian refugees and uh with my mom we went to a for school and got the on board a because this director of the school\nUm said okay I I don't care that you're effigy I see that you are a good student so I Will I Will let you in as a guest\nAnd are actually show so in that day he broke the low but he told me he told me this summer that actually my uh um you know register\nUncommon sense [laughter] about human earlier and so I was really a admitted as a as a gas in after a couple of years that the that the law changed uh then they regularly you know I'm I go I was admitted to that high school and then I\nGot my degree so you see it was really difficult I I knew that I Am talented I knew that I can be really excellent but the um but I had to overcome some of these are brutal critic of obstacles that a a\nYou know offer um our students the opportunity to get a\nA you know MIT degree if [laughter] if ah this is feasible and they are um are able and I'm sure there will be a extremely competitive with students in a pool\nAnd um and I must say it's um it's a great experience I think uh for uh for them but most importantly the it's the\nIt's the pot for them to find jobs to change their lives in the policy matter and the most importantly to back to an education\nIn such a challenge in ...\nSo um\nYou think MIT was sort of uniquely suited to get involved in something like that [laughter] okay uh of course I mean MIT is ah is one of the best universities are in the world and um\nAnd I think I think are the biggest um um resource we have here our students um and a faculty of course\nAnd um and all that everything that is you know boiling this pot is is just amazing and a and I think are being able to channel some of those are developments are and of course give a our students and faculty the between the two to express\nAnd it was able and he's able to really offer that um opportunity for us to to channel that a a desire and also you know make a huge impact that the global scale\nSo what's your vision for going forward are you trying to reach out into new geography is are you trying to unpack more people in\nWell so we we started in Jordan as I said and the and a with a incredible results are and um\nI mean there are there are um right now a macro masses programs that are\nYou know attract students from all around the world we we got a you know applications from I don't know twenty flask countries or and or an apple who are from everywhere here in Georgia and the exactly so say I envision a um you know continuing this or I'm\nJoe graphically localize the action that uh uh includes a you know um [noise]\nInclude said this face to face activities but also really expand globally and or\nMaybe focused more on on digital education components only just to make sure that are these people are um at let's let's start from the beginning they cannot they are generally not that joke drastically you know a stable they they move migrants\nAnd and you know they design programs that can follow them through their you know migration challenges or is something important and in this case I mean Michael masses are is definitely an or in the model to follow and I think uh with my colleague said the open learning and that\nAre in ... or you know we we will uh um work on improving that um you know\nSet up yeah I don't know how it thinks students yeah they are in Jordan many or I mean I can name a I'm a ... or this um online course or that a is a within a helping and they're giving a lot of students um\nUm industries but uh he mine is a a one of the leaders and uh and uh I I Need to say react to scare also because of say that about ... who helped us a a starting a\nProgram and the ... ah from um [noise] uh from um the Lebanon and um\nSo yes there are many companies and I expect really or this or a pool to be a become bigger and bigger considering the fact that the ah our students are great who came out we we are realizing how a ... a\nExcellent they are and I I don't think I'm there will there are many obstacles to have them working remotely for or any company out around the world so ah\nJust to clarify so that we have two groups of students were talking about we have the the refugees students that are Syrian refugees living in Jordan and then we have the MIT students who now participate in these programs ...\nAnd we'll we'll hear from some of them in a matter of what can you tell me a bit about what they work on when they go in and why it's a great opportunity for I mean they will be probably the best\n[laughter] or um individuals to describe what what is important for them but I think um as I mentioned before at at this is a great opportunity for us to to channel or our knowledge and our a passion into\nThe win win for everyone I mean the students said that ah you know are coming from a ...\nAward experience or a working with a with students that are you will learn probably ah you know drudgery that they might tens and get a job at Google is just a very easy example\nOf an odd number one and this is this the moment is er and er and I mean again it's\nA it's just I'm just a great I think a opportunity for us I'm a and to do good in that in this world\nThank you so much a mirror and David\nCan you tell us a little bit more about what you ... the role you play in supporting this program\nShore or you know well I mean and his colleagues for developing a study of reactor ... will will ... may I was thinking about this idea of reacting developed the we had several conversations a you know the refugee issue is a global issue\nIn Michigan is a global program and it was clear um that that would be a good match as a partnership with trying to see how can we make major impact around the world\nWhere there are starting in the middle east but there are other centers around the world has to be done in and we had a misty have this growing program called the global teaching labs rush students um teach\nHigh school and college students around the world we had to have running already for several years\nIn with a musician it seemed like this would be great matched to really latch onto and prepare our students to be able to make impact in the world by learning about different countries different challenges around the world\nAnd really building on the course of study being able to teach 'em all these people around the world so that both our students will be able to learn about the regions of the challenges in the world and also built in the course of study and make real impact and I think that you know moving forward\nUh working together [noise] All right thank you David or we're going to take a quick musical break and then we'll be back with some of these famous students who never been hearing about\n\nOh\nJust going to take a minute\nJust doing it they can we went in and I didn't read I'm just going to take a minute\nThe hot and then when the ... days when does the cat in pain this half way how to handle the longest and all the time with the same time or money get five as tall as the years [noise] I guess not pass it on\nOn that thing is that is that this stuff happened on\nSmall ... foot bones on how to survive the violence the double what we see you breathe but as soon as ... as they try to think you need to they only gave him the way in the same but the dear mama\nRight there because I don't want me to give a price says and then the man to\nAnd every time I found\nEnded in threes home this thing to\nDays so more so when we get their hearts on the horses do when they try to keep it down but they do the job in a corner in the lord\nAnd we got to hang out with them they're so did you go um we went to the royal ... museum um I don't know if that's the correct\nTitle [laughter] what what is there to see their\nUm there's a bunch of old cars that the king of Jordan um had owned or had read it in a different time and so you can learn about like the history of the royal family there and also of course it was pretty cool\nWeather any ... or so are you still in touch with any people who are you guys talking on what's up or anything like that\nYeah I I have ... I think I have some of them on Snapchat too yeah yeah and one of his how are they doing one of the ...\nThey seem to be doing great I mean they oftentimes we'll just see something that I posted in reply to me and say like oh that looks awesome or hoping great time yeah\nAnd I've seen a lot of them really active on Facebook about sharing news about the program to encourage other people to hide this year which is really exciting it was\nPretty good endorsement yeah so in your reactions with them outside of the classroom did you get to hear any of their stories or what drove them into you know being an exile in Jordan you connect with anyone on that level\nSo um there was one student who I think had a particularly inspiring story or his name is Mohammed he um was from Syria and he was one of the older students in the program and so he had been working in Syria as a petroleum engineer um\nAnd then when the war broke out in Syria he had to flee to Jordan with his family\nAnd unfortunately in Jordan he isn't able to find a job as a petroleum engineer it's much less common in Jordan and Syria and so he really wanted to\nBe able to restart his life\nTo computer science I think he said he did like a one month long program or something like that before he did react\nAnd so I think being at the program was really going to help him he was just such a very hardworking and um\nHe was always very persistent even when he was confused by any of the topics he was the best of always being able to ask questions and always wanted to learn more which I thought was really inspiring\nOn and he mentioned to us that\nHe has um children and and one of his kids has autism and he his kid is I'm not able to go to school like the normal schools in part because he's a Syrian refugee in part because he has autism and so he at home and he spends time\nI'm trying to get the best education for his son he also on his own time works with UNICEF to tutor on other Syrian refugee children because many of them can't go to school and so on top of all of this he was\nUh doing the reactor program to learn computer science and get real work experience and I just thought that was the most inspiring story because all around he's just an amazing person and\nThis program can really open doors for him\nWhat if you're doing now and you know I\nThink he is I mean the program is still going on um they're still doing their internships and working through the loss of the online classes so um I think I assume he's\nStill doing that job from do you have anybody who is there anybody that resonated with you and\nI'm just one thing was that so there was one student who for a lot of the program was just very quiet and like we did we did our course and we gave the students at ... at the end and she didn't do very well because she wasn't really understanding what we're talking about and I think it was really cool to see like when\nAnd siblings so it was very hard for her you know to speak up and to make her needs available um for just being able to provide that for her it was really special\nBut how did the experience of sort of encourage you to reflect on some of your own privileges and things like that in this world than what you guys have had the pleasure of experiencing versus what other people do\nYeah I I think it definitely really emphasized how lucky lucky we are to be here at MIT just to be Americans um\nHim I feel particularly privileged because both my parents are software engineers as well so really I was just coming from\nThe perfect background to end up as an MIT student [laughter] I Am [laughter] so I think being an interacting with all these people who have none of the same advantages that we have is very eye opening and it just makes me want to keep working with groups like that because\nI think that access to a great education chance to be a computer scientist shouldn't be based on your family background or where you're coming from and I think that we need to continue working to eliminate those barriers in the world\nYeah um and then also for me sort of made me think about how different my life could have been if my parents had come to the U.S and if I had grown up in Iran and just how much more challenging I Would have been for me to get these educational opportunities and to learn about computer science and to find a job so\nHow do you think this experience ... sort of influence your ... going forward in terms of career but also in terms of the things you think about the things you care about\nIs definitely made me much more aware of news about refugees in the world first of all I mean I had as I said before I really only had a baseline level of understanding but now that I've been there I always make sure to stay up to date on the news about\nWell thanks forms that then if the opportunity comes up to continue hoping I Would be aware of it and have enough like background I see the situation and so I think I'm planning on just throughout my life continue to look out for opportunities where I can make a difference and help more people learn about\nYeah George Clooney want to continue teaching as much as possible and especially teaching computer science and I probably want to do detail again this year\nOh that's great [laughter] All right well thank you we're we're going

Charlie coal has this is WNPR in Cambridge\nThe ... of power who you wouldn't think wouldn't necessarily be the ones for then didn't kind of these very innovative groundbreaking strategies but they have it they have experience and their their language is just in stark contrast to Trump's language therefore it thinking they've seen what hasn't worked are calling for new approaches\nThat do work and for trying new things as well while Trump just looks backwards and then there's just also not a consensus with in the un member states unfortunately a lot of countries signed onto this\nThat and you know domestically are more reform oriented\nAnd probably did so out of a lot of heavy diplomatic pressure from the United states was unfortunate that Canada signed on even though they are ramping up their harm reduction um interventions increasing the number of super I've consumption facilities moving to\nLegalize marijuana and there are other countries that signed onto this that have much more progressive policies domestically but probably just felt a lot of pressure\nFrom the Trump Administration and then there are countries that are you know engaging in brutal lethal war on drugs that's a good example is is the Philippines in which thousands of people have been killed in this drug war and\nAnd and President Trump actually praised the Philippine president for his approach so there's a fractured consensus there are countries that are more for thinking and the U.S has definitely trying to regain control of the debate and and take us backwards\nWell speaking of a Philippine president who dared to Donald Trump has has not even endorsed the idea of sort of floated the idea of of executing drug dealers in this country\nThat's right it's so I mean it's terrifying it's extremely worrying that not once but twice Trump has mentioned the idea of of the death penalty for people who sell drugs you know it's\nI sometimes and media the human rights I'm over the punitive approach is sort of set up as\nIn this corner you know but for one thing humane ... is good you know but for another it's effective if our goal is individual in public health and wellbeing you know but I I sometimes believe that many media conversations on this debate\nLeave out what various parties would even defined as winning for some people anybody who alters their consciousness in any way should be punished you know period but we don't explore that a ... you know there's a fundamental debate over the framing of whether\nThis is a health issue or this is a morality issue I think\nThat's right I mean it's we've just seen the total failure of repressive policies\nProhibition you know and repression and punishment are an ethical and an up and solves but they also are inefficient it doesn't work and there are examples of of strategies that do work that do center\nPublic health and human rights and dignity and development it's not just immoral it's also inefficient\nWill domestically too there are things happening in Ohio where I understand twelve people die each day from accidental overdose as there was the there's a conference September twenty seventh and twenty eighth that's talking about health centered treatment that's talking about harm reduction terms but you know they're missing from this Trump\nA document so we're having this conversation within this country as well all of these varying approaches\nLocalities leaders and advocates are really being able to push through groundbreaking strategies that we're almost not conceivable in this country up until\nOf cities around this country and this is not a new crazy idea globally there are many countries that have supervised consumption facilities many cities and there has never been a single overdose death in any of them they've been peer reviewed there's evidence that that fees work\nTo support people who are using drugs that they lower the rates of infectious diseases of overdose deaths\nThey're incredibly effective and they're incredibly humane and I think you know now we're at a point where in desperation a lot of cities are finally accepting the words of people who use drugs and people who advocate for people who use drugs to say that this is\nWhat we want and says what works and it looks like we're gonna we're going to be able to open one in this country over the coming\nYear which is very exciting but we also need to scale up other programs that all that have proven to work like syringe exchange programs the availability of no locks on all of these harm reduction strategies that have worked elsewhere and hear\nMedia could be playing a role in letting folks know that those things are possible and happening\nAbsolutely which is I Am I'm very thankful that that you're hosting this program because again this is not sort of inventing the wheel these are proven strategies\nAnd the more that that's presented a as a viable and helpful of the better and and if we think about the amount of resources that we pour into prohibition and law enforcement that good could go to treatment and support and harm reduction we would just be in a much better place\nWell I don't want to close without noting the maybe most recent I'm sort of positive step as we record which is that the sits a act the stop the importation and trafficking of synthetic analogs active twenty Seventeen that the house passed in July I understand it was kept out\nThings in the more punitive direction that we're talking about it sounds like has been halted for the moment\nBut there are these little glimmers of hope because I think people are becoming more sensitized to this issue is that is a small victory yes\nWe've been speaking with Hannah ... senior international
