this is WNPR of course where men\nBark repeatedly [noise] that's one interpretation [noise] eighty eight point one on your FM dial [noise]\nAnd uh WNPR dot org if you prefer\nYour digital devices I'm David Goodman yes the central ... they called me that because I like to dwell on things and tonight\nI'm dwelling on a couple of things one is\nThe red Sox are playing a game for the American league championship series this evening it's the bottom of the third inning and the red Sox are up three to two and so if I'm a little distracted this evening that's because uh\nActually have the game streaming in our control room\nAnd uh\nI'll give updates along the way\nFamily comes first radio second but baseball is a close third [noise]\nI'm also dwelling tonight on the fact that we're about a twenty five days I Would say away from our two thousand and Eighteen fundraising\nProgramming we bring you nonstop eclectic fundraising [noise]\nAnd the fundraiser begins on November eighth it's a Thursday this year and runs through Wednesday the fourteenth so once again they have decided the powers that are have decided that uh\nThey don't need sound and fury to raise much money will be the next to last program heard on the fundraiser or or the almost the next to last that might be two shows after us that night\nOne and it's just fine we'll do our best will ah will reach out to our loyal\nUm are loyal listeners and even those catching us for the first time a an ass to support us 'cause we only do that once once a year the rest of the time we uh\nWe make do with whatever we have in the in the kitty oh in the pot but we appreciate our listeners they've helped us out quite a bit over the years and so um you know no complaints on on that score but tonight since uh the game is on\nAnd I'm\nI'm just kind of tired of\nThe daily from ... and that that that I feel over the are the people in charge of this country and the people making decisions in this state\nI'm not all bad but mostly Ninety nine point nine percent bad I'm ... will just try to be slightly entertaining tonight will play some tunes\nIf a if you wanna actually talk about stuff over the air we don't do call ends very often but uh the number is ...\nThe three uh in the bottom of the third inning a tie ball game All right well you socks and you didn't think that the Astros were going to go away um you know they weren't going to cringe when they're in a little cave just because Jackie Bradley junior hit a grand slam last night but ah\nHopefully the red Sox can muster the uh the offense and and means necessary [noise]\nAnyway what was I saying oh yeah so we'll we'll hear some music will have some surprises we're actually going to reach very deep down into the WNPR\nAre actually the W. TBS archives before Nineteen Seventy nine or Nineteen eighty or so when we switched call letters from W TBS to WMD are\nA number of the\nDJ's and announcers here would produce all sorts of funny spots not unlike the funny spot we heard earlier that Brian played the ah the the the program promotional announcement\nThat was um uh affectionately making fun of the public service announcement about kids being going outside into the wilderness and having fun out there rather than staying home playing video games all day indoors um [noise]\nWhat was that for that I think for the parrot us paradox box I was a fun announcement anyway well here's some of those will reach back into the sixties and seventies and really deep into our archive\nOr for some of that stuff and ah\nIf you have any comments on what you what you hear or would like to connect or could Joel or cohabitation is I often say six one seven to five three eight eight one zero that's six one seven to five three\nEighty eight ten let's start to show off musically with some boots\nOf a better tomorrow\nSound and fury\n[noise]\n\nLike\nWake up in a home to get like ... the model witness reach me oh you get a you know\n... waiting for reparations to pay your screaming you can stay plus\nCould mentally per se but that's just another trick too much like buses minimum\nUp ... up in the changes I didn't watch out what the struggle that brings us to put\nPaul with the man that comes to the scoop Bogle flow still Maliki the friend that keeps us welfare and all the time and they just will not bring a satisfaction without should know who can disagree with me\nWhat it means to you face these documents the slate CEO Jane\nSaw that on January and I'm\nLike no no no no he\n\n\nDana Dana that\nOpening\nIn\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] which ...\n\n...\n... ...\n... ...\n...\n...\n\nAnd\nA dog ...\nAnd the ... the the ... all their\n\nWell tomorrow for the wisdom blown [noise] ...\n...\n[noise] and they put her own\nCold and snow known [noise] all\nThe the news\nHow poll [noise] all\nThe way [noise]\nAll the role model says the own money [noise]\nAnd ... and they say the new in\nTown and and and you can turn\nOn\nThe term [noise] burner\n[noise]\nFor her or no [noise] ...\nAh don't matter and\nAnd or\nA dog ...\nAnd the gravy B\nO ...\nO\n... or ... or ... ...\n... a woman who [noise]\n[noise]\n\nBoring Johnston with are worried about the new quadratic formula yes friends here it is the tool of tools the handy dandy combination formula that is good for all quadratic equations whether they be rational irrational are both\nThe formula is the single most important formula did you ever use you'll live with it eat with it drink with it walk with it and even talk with it it uses are so multiple that it's hard to imagine being without it and what does this modern miracle of nature costs\nIt costs absolutely nothing the makers of fly by night mattresses a division of nocturnal aviation we'll give you one free with absolutely no strings attached to use it on your math use it in your science use it in your bath tub\nNever will let you down to get your quadratic formula send a stamp self addressed envelope to waste basket room fifty oh thirty Copernicus Damone that's the quadratic formula use it today tonight [noise]\nCharlton Heston ... Billy Graham and\nMinerva Europe\nWill not be hurt so that we may bring you the following special program [noise]\nAnd fulfillment of its obligation to this fine community\nW TBS presents a program of inspiration\nHistory and taxed\nAbout to hear is true\nAny similarities living or otherwise\nPurely coincidental [noise]\nNow WCBS presents to the beach here\nThousand four hundred years ago today\n[noise]\nIn the beginning God created the heavens and the yard [noise]\n\nDammit turn on the line and God said ... therapy light [noise]\nAnd God saw the light\nWas good ... ... after several under eventful days of creation gods said my God I knew I forgot something there upon he realized he was talking to himself\nGod was lonely he needed someone to talk to someone to call his own but mainly someone to clean up after the elephants\nSo God created man in his own image but his nose wasn't nearly as sensitive and God called them in Adam for that was his name Adam couldn't take the terrible ribbon God was giving him so he gave him one of his bears and God said\nWhat am I supposed to do with this eat it but I haven't been vetted barbecue sauce yeah this is a fine ... while they're your elephants say about the one thing\nWoman is that anything like an elephant that for me to no way of you to find out\nGod had had a pretty rough six days so he decided to get out of town for the weekend but while God's away the children\nWill play ... ... that's what this one was good and watch you play [noise]\nBut it's all of that and so on and I'm In my house [laughter]\n\nAnd think oh this is the first and seemed to be the one\nThat uh [noise] ... no no this is the leading last fall on the phone this ah with\nAdam Adam ... I\nThat leads to listen to me or if you don't like that joke\nI Know ... I'm ... I'm eve you're sitting on my belief\nUm the the quest to to ah to die with the most money if you will with the most toys I'm leads these institutions to ... ah forget forget about who actually\nInvest their money in these institutions who pays the bills who who's taking the risks\nUm and ah and that's I think that's why people are fall prey to banks insurance companies\nPharmaceutical companies other ... other um institutions of of a commerce\nAnd I'm like I think Sonia wrote this song or and up put put the ideas of what happens to\nA new from a Don Karen who ah has become in my opinion has become somewhat of an Internet star with his parity project we heard something very new called hate dude\nI don't think I have to tell you which which song or in the pantheon of music uh he's uh he's using their he's parity in there or who which family he's buried parity and there\nWere some things straight out of the WMBA R. W. P. B. S. archives of course a radio station needs to be named after the technology a broadcasting system W TBS which went on to become Turner Broadcasting and that's a whole story\nThat maybe I'll tell if you haven't already heard it or read about it I'll tell during fund raising how TBS became MBR\nBack in the late seventies early eighties we heard the quadratic formula\nAnd the Bible the greatest story told so far checks Ritter something old from an album from a vinyl lp called high noon her blood on the saddle and the Washington Square is from Nineteen eighty nine\nA green back dollar an old white axed in tune from their album fair and square [noise]\nMichelle indigo cello and nocturnal sunshine from a Nineteen Ninety four a album that was part of the red hot and a blue series of records is was red hot and cool\nWe are also called stolen moments this was a series of records that were so\nI had a lot of artists on them or we're concerned about uh HIV and AIDS and the ... the sales of the albums and the concerts went to um a ... a hell\nIt'd be to prevent aids and that sort of thing we heard nocturnal sunshine that that track features um Herbie Hancock and we started this the set off with Wu Tang clan a a better tomorrow title track of their two thousand and fourteen record a better tomorrow\n[noise] so you're up to date here on a sound and fury once again I'm Dave good men the central ...\nAnd ah I'm flipping over to the baseball game and it looks as though the red Sox have tied up the game a it was to one and then two two and then it was a the read it to a Sox\nKnow it was a yeah was three to two and then a Houston tied it up three three and then Boston a Houston made went ahead on a a home run or in the bottom of the force they believe\nAnd uh the red Sox in the top of the fifth tied the ball game so this is going to be this is going to be a battle of giants he has to really really good teams but currently it's the middle of the fifth and we have a tie score between the red Sox and the Astros for all\nA an update to something I talk to I think I talked about this last week or the week\nBefore I'm a very large group of radio producers and podcaster has got together in Chicago or the first weekend in October at the same weekend that we were hosting honk here in Somerville [noise]\nFor something called the third coast conference where people get together to network and to hear of folks in the industry or talk about best practices\nIndependent pod casters and that sort of thing and it was a concern at the conference wouldn't uh wouldn't go forward for the whole weekend because members of the night here union ah were striking in Chicago against the Hyatt hotel there\nWell they the the the union UNITE HERE locals number one actually a has a settled\nAnd come to a contract agreement with uh uh with the Hyatt Hotels are high it which I just learned this recently is owned by Marriott which is actually the world's largest biggest a hotel chain\nUm they own a lot of properties um apparently they own Hyatt they bought high it recently and uh the big concern was a which they settled in this new contract is that\nWhen they laid people when the hotels lay people off especially in the wintertime in areas where there isn't as much tourism and as many people booking hotel rooms they lay their staff off but they don't continue paying their health care while they're laid off and these are people that are going\nTo be hired back year after year they're hired back but there are slow periods when they don't have any health care well in this new contract at least in Chicago they uh they they have now are arranged to continue paying health care cost for health insurance to these workers\nNow getting back to the third coast radio conference at least one colleague of mine that I spoke to earlier this week said that uh she believed that a pressure came to bear\nOn the uh management of the Hyatt hotel because the folks from third coast in there were thousands\nAnd not to hold events at the hotel and that that's the sort of a that's a sort of economic pressure it may sort of be second hand as a as a as a rather than you know direct protest but it's still economic pressure the fear that the management of Hyatt Hotels had that maybe third coast wouldn't come back\nThis is an annual conference um ... helped push forward the negotiations in and got the union in the end hotel management to negotiate [noise] now so that's\nA a positive notes having said all of that here in Boston UNITE HERE local twenty six is still a a\nIn a dispute with I'm\nMary it operated hotels including hotels in the seaport district or the Ritz Carlton Boston the Sheraton Boston W Hotel Boston or the west in Boston waterfront and the west in a cop we place a staffer are on strike\nAnd in fact on Saturday this coming Saturday at two PM there's going to be a rally on behalf of striking a Marriott workers um who say that one job should be enough they shouldn't have to work multiple jobs in order to for instance in order to have healthcare coverage\nSo it's ... am a on a Saturday\nAnd I am searching to see\nExactly where the demonstration is taking place let's see\nI Will follow the links and a ... square so ah October twenty us to solidarity rally or with Marriott Hotel work\nFor ... ... square on a Saturday and\nUh yeah so you may have\nDriven through the city or walked around the city recently in ... and hurt folks on both orange those are the those are the uh hotel workers you know looking for a looking looking for a fair deal I I Would say\n[noise] again you're listening to sound and fury on WNPR Cambridge the views and opinions expressed he of course are those of the participants and not necessarily those of the staff and management of WNPR MIT or the technology Broadcasting Corporation\nWill go back to some music I'll go back to keeping an eye on the ball game and this is Mr burnings
