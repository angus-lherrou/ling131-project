I Know that's what I figure [laughter]\nIt's still the same accent ashamed music can shame fads\nYou actually played the Lynn auditorium a few weeks\nRight there was a fun and it was good time [noise] so we're going to\nThere were at least a couple the echoes\nAnd try and while he does what did your homework always do\nYou [laughter] well yeah the my very first ban I I started when I was twelve years old first we were the echoes about six weeks later we changed our name to the tornadoes and uh my very first gig\nWas in my home town of Niles, Michigan I had just turned Thirteen and uh we played the American legion hall and I think we made fifty bucks and that was I couldn't believe somebody was paying me money to do this\nUsing it a lot for back then\nIt was it was to us well when it when we were twelve and Thirteen yeah ... well that's right it was either mowing lawns are planted a bad there was no water so at any rate that was my first professional I guess you'd call professional is\nIs when you get paid for it I guess that was my first ... yeah\nSo uh the echoes were in junior high common the natives were in high school there's a single floating around there you know on line I'm sure you're aware of that\nYeah there's a couple of them actually uh I had two little a label deals one when I was fourteen with a little label in Michigan called north way sound and another one when I was a sixteen a cold snap records and that was where hanky panky came from my first at\nNo well the one ah from sixty to which I'm sure people\nCan't yeah that was north way south yeah that was the fireball original a long long that's right and long ponytail that's right\nAnd but you your son was the right which was sunny pretty good for Fifteen year old you\nAre not bad I guess it was a call Judy on the flip side and that was one I rode when you first see your name\nAnd all I can say is it was just such a kick the beyond that you boxes and stuff of course the record died a miserable death didn't START I know\n\nBut the second record was a little more interesting because um\nI was involved with the local vending machine guy ... boxes and we had all the boxes in about a hundred mile radius and we were played locally and uh hanky panky was to record it was one of four records that we did with this company for sites\nSo ah the record again died a miserable death because we had no distribution but I'm a couple of years later I graduated from high school and sixty five and I took my band on the road and we were playing clubs in the mid ...\nBill was conscience and right in the middle of my two weeks the guy goes belly up the IRS shut them down from that ... so uh we got a quip man out just barely and went home feeling like dogs you know real losers\nBut that's how the good lord works because as soon as I got home I got the call that changed my life\nI'm a disc jockey in Pittsburgh and a local entrepreneur bootleg eighty thousand copies of\nHanky panky this record that I had made three years earlier and um sold them in the city of Pittsburgh and we were sitting at number one you\nDon't get any money for that sort of thing well no but God Bless the crux of the beginning of your dad started my career and in the criminal business that you weren't the criminal\nYou know I just wanted to go back for a minute though about hanky panky I found it quite interesting how you managed to discover songs that others road but we're forgotten or underutilized sure and you would notice them as the beside you noticed them on half the tapes lying around that ... very very clever\nI was always interested in you know music that I had never heard before\nAnd a lot of it was good that was so well let's put it this way um I've worked in a record shop in all of high school so I could promote my band out of the record shop and I was always looking for things to play hanky panky was a song though that was a you know I heard another group play\nAnd I saw the response to it I just immediately put people on the dance floor and I said man we got to do this I don't know what that is but did you see the reaction from everybody and so all I could remember was my baby ... thank you take we had to make up everything else\nAll that boy John and that boy John was about John Kennedy and when he was assassinated they pulled the record off the market so nobody heard the a side and much less the beside so uh when we came out with the record no one had ever heard of before\nAnd you must mentioned who the raindrops were various\nJet yeah Jeff Berry LA Greenwich to to to great writers from the Brill Building in New York\nAnd I feel obligated to mentioned a few of their songs because people might not be my baby river deep mountain high chapel of love and the list goes on forever\nOh yeah all the Phil Spector stuff and uh um do Ron Ron and all that stuff I they were just amazing writers and uh I got to know 'em both very well but the point is that uh the record exploded out of Pittsburgh\nAnd um you know I had no group\nBecause the group that I had originally recorded that with was you know in six different places so I sort of grab the first group I could find in Pittsburgh\nAnd uh they became the new ... because we had changed her name by the way to the Sean does when we did ... so a a week later we were in New York selling the master a and we ended up selling it to let that of course that's a whole other involves story\nOh well we're going to get into it we made it it's it's really important to your history I have to say yes\nIt is and you are on your way to worldwide domination but you did have to get a major record label so you could go beyond the Pittsburgh rich right that's right and I find it really amusing maybe it is and to you or wasn't or isn't any more but you entered the world of Morris Levy levy levy\nLevy ... has a very tore his character shall we say yeah he kind of took it up\nDid long ponytail a fireball tune it would only you're part of that in way back at the top I failed to mention the background the bed to my introduction was the title track to Nineteen sixty nine\nYou just heard a little there okay back to the Tommy James interview you know leave he had some real claim to fame before you met\nHim oh yeah nobody sold singles like roulette\nYou know he had a bunch of ... star lighters Jimmy Rogers\nA loop Christie ah oh God I mean the list goes on he um was also a very good at making things happen mhm you know he really could\nShake the universe if he got up really wanted to do something he was an amazing guy amazing figure but as I say it was every bit of\nA mobster yeah\nSo that was that was our story for a long time\nWhen we should mention also that Moore's levy was responsible or I think the founder of bird land grab\nA bird lands absolutely the biggest jazz club in the world\nHe had the great rap and there's no reason you wouldn't want to be with him except for the fact that the other labels were much bigger in the public eye I guess\nThat's right and uh you know Mars was a fascinating individual he could have been the c._e._o. of a company\nAnd yet he chose the dark side and I always\nAm amazed when I think of Mars and think of the things that that happened there because there's a lot of ... actually comical things happened there too in addition to\nYou know scary things I mean it was just a lot of uh amazing things that went on you never knew who was going to be hanging out at roulette cardinals Spelman came up [laughter] [laughter] um\nYou know it felt like a Morris was a an abusive father\nThat's that's exactly how it felt um and that is really I guess the gist of the story you know behind\nThis New York fog and somehow it works\nIt was like a father bowling his young\nThat's exactly what was it was like it was like a the kid who get smacked around by his dad but he sends him to college\nSo yeah and it kind of went and went on for years until the boy who was you became a zone men and you dared to challenge him he was right it was\nQuite a blow out at the end and that kind of dangerous but ah yeah that's all part of the story\nRight well I loved the story of the book is amazing so Hank it's going to be a movie now well what ... what's going on with that because you were saying that a few years back what's causing the slowdown\nWell it it's not really a slowdown is it just takes that's how these things go rocky took ten years\nOn you know it's just it it by everybody that comes on ah the team is a separate negotiation it's amazing anything ever gets made but a ... is producing the film she produced Goodfellas and a casino\nAnd she produced Hugo with Martin Scorsese a couple of years ago\nAll Scorsese stuff I'm a yes you know what she was married to him at one point there\nAnd but she's a brilliant producer and uh oh she did the color of money she did uh the last temptation of Christ\nAnd those are those are also scores see there yeah\nSo the the two of them really worked well together so\nDoes he have the rights Martin to your ...\nNo no I'm what's gonna happen as well Matthew Stone just uh the screenplay and um I have this tremendous respect for screenplay riders now that I never realized I had because they have to do with a dialogue\nDo it in scenes with dialogue between people you know so the screenplay is really a very magical\nProcess to go through ... it's a whole nother art rate really is that I have great respect these guys now but at any rate I'm getting a hell of an education and everybody that comes on the team all the technical people and everything is a separate negotiation and then finally the director which they're going after now\nAnd she's boiled it down about three people that she really watch once that happens once the director is selected then things really move along\nSo I Hope to heck it does come up because this is an amazing thing and I don't know that any there's been any story like get out there\nWell thank you I I I think you're right though I I really believe that rock and roll and uh the mob or very potent combination\n\nThat with\n\nI\nLive in\nA [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] right\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nI\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nAnd a couple of other things about uh levy he was not Italian or you know it was true and I know you can tell by the last name really and he was the real life modeled behind somebody on TV\nOh but the aside cash they used to call it much more sleep it was his real name was marsh and the character hash on the Sopranos was directly taken from more slowly\nRight but not as big and not as intimidated are not nearly as scary as more is really was right and one of the other things that we did was she had just strawberries record chain which we in New England know all about\nYeah as a matter of fact I watched it is where I think the home office was the the\nAnd that's where we are [laughter]\nWell you knew you knew and he spent all the money that should've been yours\nWell he got away with a big chunk of it or what happened it was more slavery a course a was\nFinally arrested up in Boston at strawberries the feds got him and for racketeering and all kinds of stuff\nYou know nothing compared to what he actually did they got him on the lesser of the charges but he was then a ... this was several years after I left roulette\nHe was convicted and sentenced to ten years and he died of cancer in Nineteen Ninety before he could ever served a day and uh uh\nHe asked for me and I was supposed to go see him or right after I got off the road I was playing a gig in Chicago when I found out that he died and ah I have very very mixed feelings about all this because uh yeah I cared about the guy but\nYou know doing business with them was such a disaster is just a you know what are you gonna do\nYeah we'll children do care about their abusive fathers\nThat is true I guess and I are so anyway I have I still miss him a in a in a funny kind of way although if he was alive he would want to own all the stuff\n\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na [noise] I'm taken\nOf two sons in that uh in the last three the San ... like the beach boys that was from the Modi Modi Nineteen sixty eight album you're getting\nFunding thing that was the only on released song on a greatest hits them that came out in early sixty seven I think something special the best of Tommy James in the Sean Bell's\nOkay I Want to give away some tickets to not Tommy he showed up and Lynn I'm a number of weeks ago but at the middle east downstairs least scratch Harry famous Jamaican reggae guy we used to ... producer and inventor he was recording artist and counted them\nHe had twenty\nAlbums that came up between Nineteen sixty nine and seven Seventy nine he worked with the way ... among many other people so if you like tickets six one seven to five three eighty eight tend to be the number to call the first caller and here's more Tommy James\nYour next giant hit the biggie after hanky panky was I think we're alone now\nYeah well actually we let go but I think we're alone now when gold or several times over if you really want to get technical we sold several million of I think we're allowed\nUs for six months and uh it really changed the course of my career and it changed me because I learned so much about making records with I think we're alone now about the Fisher the physics of making record the science of making records\nHow were you involved in that\n[noise] well vote gentry and Richard Cory Adele became my producers and we switch studios and we we began layering our music rather than a back up until then they were were recording everything mano even though you have\nFour tracks or eight tracks you still would be doing it all as if it were a mano date you know what I'm saying he didn't he\nOh we began layering using a was I think we're alone or use you know base and the drums\nAnd once that got the way we want it and we add the rhythm instruments we you know we'd had guitar we'd had keyboards\nAnd finally vocals so you built the record a step at a time rather than doing it all at once and that was a big change it sounds pretty archaic today but that was a big change and and also I I I just want to say this that\nWe learned that we weren't writing songs anymore we were writing records and that really was an epiphany that really change things\nYou were you were writing a within a three minute time limit you had so many ... beats per minute you had so many versus so many courses bridges solo and I said\nOh I see so you're talking about the actual composition you got yeah familiar with but I thought you were talking about you know one song out of the long player but\nAnd I think we're alone now was the record for example of little things like uh\nHow long it into the one you want to let the disc jockey talk over the top of the first seven seconds here record as she's introducing the record so we can tune can can can you can do and we did that and and so ... you could talk over the top of it I also learned that I'm\nOn the radio less is more\nYou know it's gonna something's going to fill up a hundred percent of your radio speaker and the fewer instruments you have the more important each one become and the more investment you had those less important everyone comes it's not like listening to something alive so\nI think we're alone now it's stepped down into the into the hook\nA where he's just had a the eighth note\nI think we're alone I was placed as a ballot for me and I said we got to do something like I could hear the hook was smashed but um it was too slow we went in the studio at a demo and that's where we came up with the ... I played guitar and that and and came up with the eighth notes to what later got called packing\nYou know or you're doomed to come to me too and um that became the signature sound for the record so all these things I think we're alone that taught me you know how to make records for AM radio and by way we're talking about AM radio not not ...\nIt really hadn't come into it so yeah that's right\nAnd it was they still had the compressors and limit ... and and so the sound of a mano single on an am station was an amazing thing\nI just got this incredible appreciation for modern recording because you couldn't when you're mixing it for example you can't pan anything out of each other's way you have to do it with equalizer ...\nYou know you have to eat cute things out of each other's way 'cause it's all coming from central point\nOh I don't want to get as far as I shouldn't be here on out I'm Out in the weeds now but ah [laughter] this this this this whole all this stuff was I learned was I think we're alone now\n[noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] the\nThe leading to on this ah [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] where are you guys but what do you want\n\nTo do\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nThe same to the\nTo think [noise]\n... says oh man\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nIt's been said that the song kicked off the advent of bubble gum music but listen in my mind I always figured bubble gum would sort of assembly line music that was directed at younger people with anonymous players and that's not what yours was about\nWell you know the funny part is bubblegum music came from the Nineteen ten fruit gum company right cash and cats who took Modi Modi and I think we're alone now sort of made cartoons are we going to add when we did I think were alone the term\nAnd we wanted to create over the radio and uh it was later when cash and that's and catch started fooling with the sounds I mean I I like the records they made but they they made cartoons out of that sounds\nLike a banana splits on TV the ...\n[laughter] that's yeah so but I but I Love pot don't get me wrong I I Am a pop nut I Love pop music pop records I always have so I don't think that I'm complaining\nWell of course not you wrote pop [laughter] why would complain and ... and I had very good luck with it right and then there's that one story of the backwards hate which it's hard for me to my mind around because when I hear your story when I listen to what's the mirage right\nWell what what it boils down to is we when we finished I think we're alone now that the final mix and by the way more I Would never let us do a stereo mix\nThat works that still records actual goal with he never let me do a stereo mix he was afraid we screw it up so [laughter] uh we had the model mix of a I think rely on a on a seven and a half\n\n\n\n\n[laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\nWNPR in Cambridge\nWe do [noise] ... [noise] every other Saturday remote limit the midnight on WNPR Cambridge ... point one\nClassic electronic [noise] he went to midnight [laughter]\n\nYes we just heard money money\nFrom them Moneim ... Nineteen sixty eight games in the Sean Dell's\nPrevious to that gingerbread man not a hit but a great song also from the same alimony Mooney we heard mirage which was I think we're alone now\nApparently [laughter] the tapes or backwards or at least part of it from the I think we're alone now I'm sixty seven and then the title track itself was before that okay let's move on so I mean James\nCritics than was such a style change for us and let me just tell you we were out on the road with Hubert Humphrey we are here at home for his office called and asked if we would accompany him on the presidential campaign he was running for president he was vice president running for president\nSo we played a couple of rallies and we ended up doing the whole campaign with him\nAnd criticizing clover came together as we were out on the campaign\nAnd um they were just two of my favorite words that I put together sounded per founded that's all it was and shouted poetic\nBut ... and clover strategically for us was the most important record we made after hanky panky and the reason is because it allowed us or to sell albums up\nUntil that time you know we were basically only selling singles with our share you know greatest it's albums and they think we're loan out and stuff but it was\nYou know after the size of pepper album and all of the the album sales of sixty eight that's where the ... the album was was really for for the rock and roll and what happened was that year FM radio started playing a rocket of all they had never done that before\nAnd when we went out on the campaign\nGood creating a ... if you are leaving a lot of people out but the point is when it when I got back\nAt all single sex when I got back Ninety Days later it was blood sweat and tears ledge chaplain Crosby stills and Nash Neil Young Joe Cocker oh album acts it's a sea change in in in Ninety Days the world turned upside down a\n...\nNo no no\nNo\n\nI\n\nMean\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] oh\nReally\n[laughter] ...\n\n\n\n\n... ... ... ... s\nNa na na na na na na na na na na na na na ve and then I ended up on\nOn local randomly and then I'll hold on I'm Alone homeland\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd very uh I I usually for you you had a last minute opus Ansel symphony that's true and it seems the album seemed like kind of a genre tossing musical affair it was it went up everywhere\nYou know how that record got made this a true story um my usual studio a leg girl was closed for updates they were gone or from sixteen to twenty four track so they had shut down for a couple of months\nSo I wanted to get going on in this new album and I went to another studio\nAnd a new studio was called Broadway sound it was about three blocks away from a leg grow and it was owned and everything in the studio by Whitey Ford when the Yankees so I go there and I walk in and the first thing my eyes fall on was this\nThing it looked like a Nineteen twenties switchboard with the RCA plugs [noise] you know number players you know it looked like it was that big it was the first ... synthesizer in New York and it was huge it was the size of a whole wall\nAnd it was owned by Whitey Ford who was there that day and welcome to me it took me to lunch you should've heard me talking baseball him talking rock and roll [laughter] I Wish somebody had recorded that congressman\nThankfully you were a baseball fan it's well yeah\nThe year after but at any rate um I Love this thing I started playing with the keyboards and before and it was all manner of phonics you couldn't do anything you know it wasn't like you could you could only played one note at a time\nAnd a very limited but we knew that that was the future because you can make it sound like a drum Trump the keyboard you know\nIt was just a phenomenal instrument so we ended up doing the album and ... just met you know fake music\nBut that was all ideas and several of the tracks on the album then we use this synthesizer I thought it was so cool Whitey Ford you know when he's on the mound to you know closing the ballgame out [noise]\nThrowing the curve ball he's making up since rips I just thought that was so cool\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nWas paying down that way and I knew the [noise]\n\nBringing a\n\nWay

twenty two crystal city but it it really\nFeel the same but it wasn't it wasn't about any particular uh um well as it is happening with those people apparently and still is maybe it did back then well

would come back on an album ... greatest hits or come back\nMine was teaching on the charts and all of a sudden I'm Out in LA and I turned on the TV and I see dragging the wind is on this cut out album but\nThe problem was when it record is is on it cut out and that reduces the value of it from a dollar to about a\nDime right in the midst of it was right in the middle of it being a hit he's got it out on and on and old he's ... he was kind of a jerk [laughter]\nWell he made a lot of money you know everything you touched turned the gold I mean I'm not kidding you up at his farm in upstate
