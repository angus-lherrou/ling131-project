does [noise]\nIn that group of people who doesn't have a driver's license that helps you out there so\nIn terms of what we might do at the state like California I'm you know ultimately we want to work with them to um further expand a voting access and so they've got a lot of great things going but they could for example a ... even though they've got automatic voter registration and they have\nUm online voter registration that still leaves out the population of people that um don't have driver's licenses and you know the stat on that now is that\nI Believe as a twenty fourteen um you know there were only a about sixty percent of people who were uh Eighteen year olds who were getting driver's licenses and that's down from down about twenty percent from the eighties\nYes a lot of um prefer I've seen studies that show that an Eighteen year old would much prefer having especially in the city and Eighteen year old kid would prefer having a smartphone over a driver's license if given that choice\nI mean I I think that just with things that didn't exist when I was when I was Eighteen is a and you know living in the suburbs in Texas is um you know you've got lifting Hoover you autonomous vehicles were coming more and more people are living in urban environments that you can take advantage of public transportation and so\nYou know and the California example the simplest than they can do to uh to fix that would simply be allowing voter registration forms to be submitted by facts which would allow us to do or a signature um roll out here and they would be able to bring on a whole new crop of others\nYou know making that case\nAt a time period when they're not really busy which right now in October fifteenth there's probably not the uh um the right time to do it but um it's not going to be a battle like it would be dealing with one of the states you know say I'm In the south it's actively trying to disenfranchise voters right now [noise]\n\n\nThis is Alex was on sea change radio I'm speaking to the CEO boat dot org raven Brooks so raven we mentioned California's a quote unquote friendly state and then you mentioned how\nTheir states in the south that are actively trying to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands perhaps millions of people from voting how does vote or worked to combat this dynamic we often hear about lawsuits from organizations like the ACLU\nBut does vote dot org take an active approach and fighting with those governments who are putting up barriers to voting or do you focus more on just overcoming those barriers and and\nThe day and it's not necessarily that this will continue to be the case you know in twenty Nineteen and beyond is to try to overcome those barriers I mean there's a lot of groups who have been around for a while and are well established\nThat are taking on the battling piece of this whether it's you know groups like the Brennan Center\nOr the ACLU or or any of the other voting rights groups and they're doing a great job with what resources\nThey have um we're trying to find ways\nAround that just by registering greater numbers of people I'm getting people to turn out um so that the electric changes and eventually will probably be doing some of our own advocacy for solutions we think would improve things um but we're really kind of\nA there's a lot there's some big shoes to fill as far as other organizations that have been in this fight for a long time\nLet's look a little bit closer at some of these non friendly voting states\nOne that's been in the news quite a bit recently as Georgia where it's kind of inexplicable but the secretary of state who's in charge of the election management of the state is running for governor Brian Kemp against Stacey Abrams\nThere's been a kerfuffle over fifty three thousand potential voters who've been purged from the rolls it's dispute about whether or not they've actually been purged or if they just are are put into a different tranche where they have to just bring their voter id\nWith them but Seventy percent of these fifty three thousand voters were African American and I think thirty percent of registered voters are African American in the states and and it's worth noting that camp is white and his opponent Democrat Stacey Abrams is African American\nTake off your vote died or a cat for a second and explain how this is acceptable\nNot have a conflict of interest I mean\nYou know it's it's almost like I don't even need to take off the the nonpartisan ... to to make a statement on that I mean it's it's unacceptable I mean it's a clear conflict of interest and you know it's it's\nCrazy that he's able to\nContinue to make decisions are as secretary of state which affect the electorate that ultimately will be voting on him to be governor 'em and you know and having it be done in ways that are reducing numbers of voters who would likely vote for his opponent I mean it's just\nThe fact that there is not some national standard about this this is crazy but this is kind of the patchwork of you know a election laws we live in and and a lot of them have been getting um\nYou know for the weekend I mean ah when the Supreme Court a few years ago a weekend um the voting rights act I mean not that really took the governor off of a a lot of states and they've been going full bore and trying to reduce footing access\nAnd it seems like ... this has been a kind of strategy for any state that has a Republican governor they can put in a ... perhaps the most important appointee for that Governor turns out to be the secretary of state which I Know in California is not\nThe lynchpin of our government but in these red states like\nGeorgia and we also see in Kansas where Kris Kobach is running I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name right but he's the secretary of state and he's running for governor and he's been leading Donald Trump's now defunct\nCommittee on on trying to flush out voter fraud and how does an organization that's actively trying to expand the amount of registered voters deal with the muddying of waters of voter fraud maybe first explain\nA lot of fraud in this country\nI mean first ... first of all voter fraud essentially does not exist in in the country it's a you know it it is a um a straw man argument it's it's meant to drive here I'm In into for political reasons are there have been\nNumerous long running studies from you know people at the Brennan Center and other places you know trying to document any of the cases and in it it's\nSo uh so and you know so small that you have a better chance of being hit by lightning than you do of of someone committed voter fraud\nOne state that has come up with a new wrinkle\nThat is particularly creative and pernicious is North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp is the Democratic\nSenator in that state and she's running for re election in November sixth and she's relying on the Native American vote to help her in a fairly under populated state why do you explain what North Dakota has done to try to keep Native Americans from voting for their candidate at their choice\nSo North Dakota's you know an interesting state as far as laws go so they're basically there is no voter registration you just you just show up with um you know your id at the at the polls and vote 'em but the way that it works for Native Americans as you know some of them obviously have um street addresses but for those that are on\nUm tribal land they don't have street addresses they've always had\n'em mailing addresses and uh you know that's what they were allowed to use 'em to ah to vote\nAnd recently the Supreme Court decided that mailing address Israel longer valid so\nYou know you have a state where they're not assigning street address as to the native population and you took away their one address and you know we we as a team or kind of going through the election", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cambridge",
