stay tuned for date ended up early and beyond you\nWell we just like not\nIt's not as bad now\n\nPac man when\nAnd led\nHe had to ask me when\nAbout\nAnd then there\n\nIn the context of of all of that I mean what what do you want to say today in two thousand in ... and seven where many of the same problems you were addressing in the sixties and seventies or either it's still there are worse\n[noise] yeah I think I Want to go back one second to um the or honorary degrees I did get several of them but\nAs a great friend of mine said to me kept me they wanted to put you in jail but they gave you a degree in that [laughter]\nThat that's kind of where all of that that I'm I'm a little concerned that after thirty or forty years of I'm\nTrying to do something about hunger and homelessness is more of it now than ever before\nI'm also a little concerned that our new governor seems to think the volunteerism is the way to go uh I'm here to say it isn't as and develop a tried that then that didn't work\nWe've got to change the conditions that create poverty we got to change the conditions and create\n[noise] hunger and homeless [noise] we got\nTo change the conditions\nThat keep people down instead of up [noise]\nSo so so bad I mean we were like ... and I were lucky in that I think we selected the edge as that personal geography but the people that we work with\nWeren't that lucky to select that it was like good for them that's what we're trying to change after all these years\nWhen what to say but she was also a sponge seeking ideas and insights wherever she could the challenge for all social justice activists comes in the form of institutions and their leaders who have very different ideas about justice\nAnd of course one person alone can fix all things so here we are the lyrics and the singers have changed but the song remains the same\nAs we stood near the Boston women's heritage trail in the south bend I ask Murray totally to consider history and the relationship to our current issues\nThat the numbers of people sleeping out at night on the street seems to have gone down a little bit although the the numbers of people using shelters has gone up a slight little bit [noise]\nWhy do you think she wasn't more successful uh I mean one person can't fix everything but you said she had a great relationship with mayor Menino and she was a force of nature why we why do we seem to still be stuck with thousands of people homeless and all the other issues we face\nI mean I'm going to be very Frank I think it's because we are now seeing the final this inches Reagan's war on the poor\nAnd you had a decision to vilify people who are not an administration and now subsequent administration's where they vilify people for being poor they have a a mindset that this is something that people choose which again just shows a real\nAmount of privilege in their lives that they\nCan have the luxury of thinking that I mean I work with incarcerated women now I'm On a tour for sheriff Tompkins as a senior policy analyst for women and senior programming and no one wakes up and says I Want to go to jail today [noise]\nI mean things happen in people's lives in and so you have also decisions to walk away from building affordable housing\nAnd the poor and um I mean I think and\nA lot of people have been able to do very well over the last two decades obviously the one percent or just fine and getting richer but the level of poverty the fact that wages and I'm a ... wages have not\nKept pace with the costs and particularly in cities and then there's just been a fundamental stepping back from building truly affordable housing\nAnd there is no\nThere isn't that kind of altruism where somebody says oh instead of building forty units of market rate in Boston now which is you have to make a hundred thousand dollars a year oh I think I'm going to build forty unit for\nA you know formerly homeless people to live and that's not what we're doing now we would be interesting to see how people might think about redirecting someone for sense well\nBut right now that's not the Congress that I mean but those were and if kept alive God lover she'd be the one yelling the most she would have been down there demonstrating in speaking yesterday [noise]\nMurray Charlie is referring to recent demonstrations at the south bay detention center where the sheriff's department has been holding undocumented immigrants that too would probably have been one of kept hearing and burning issues [noise]\nWell I remember um one time she had a friend took we were putting on a better fit in June fruit took me out to lunch with her\nBecause I think it was called proper rocky across from the south Jewish gr on what's going on ...\nAn MIT senior lecturer mark Harvey and his ... jazz test will be performing at ... memorial dedication tomorrow in the back that he remembers how kindly kept treated people\nIt's a nice meal to to celebrate a nice vacation and think about it so we had a lovely lovely and of course you knew the major dish you knew everybody [laughter] she really knew a lot of people that a lot of different positions in life including you mentioned mayor Menino\nAnd he spoke at her memorial and I know a Marty Walsh is going to speak at this occasion coming up and so I think she was she was one of those rare people who could meet and discuss and be friends with people from all across the the social spectrum\nAnd still maintain her own sense of integrity and purpose knew exactly who she was and um\nAnd when she needed to put a little pressure on somebody I'm sure she did that and when when she needed to just relax and let things for sort of low without that was the the motive a modus operandi\nThe festivities for the KIPP Tiernan memorial begin at one PM tomorrow on ... street between Boylston and Newberry in Boston back back as mark Harvey says mayor Walsh has been invited and
