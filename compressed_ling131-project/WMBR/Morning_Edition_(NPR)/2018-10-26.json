I she betrayed and the and this one well they signed for the one point five is that taking account of retreat a whole\nGreenland and off the west Antarctic ice sheet but they're not taking account of anything else so the thing ... accounting for uh the east Antarctic ice sheet which is so is beginning to retreat [noise] or um additional mechanisms happening\nIn Greenland are related to the fact that that you have this new process of melt water running down to the bedrock ...\nThe flow of outlet for the moment yes ... yeah that's something that they know hiking a capital and they it's again it's a question of\nThese three backs which way to get you you can go so fully enforcing feedback skits where something new happens or because of warming than using this happens makes things worse\nAnd worse and worse and they reinforce open for some feedback which what I'd drawing attention to just about to them and ...\nIf things literally blow up at their faces a Yankee or anything to blow up in the ice is they want things to to perhaps gradually accelerate but but not the most surprising things to happen because otherwise I think they feel that code to action will not be a need aids\nIf it's to a gym to coal which seems tough to me but anyway that's that's ...\n... no we've covered two of the three I thought you had mentioned a third feedback loop\nOh yes the other one that they don't mention is changes in the ocean circulation a for instance the decline in the ... it's ... it's actually having worldwide patients but in the Atlantic beach and it's reduced focal will to uh\nTo Europe so that Europe doesn't warm up as fast as a it would otherwise to but also the which is ... won't just cooling in to talk to Atlantic and the coke or Mexico or the faster than I had\nA mass producing about increasing the chance to how it comes so they the intensity of panic comes is increasing as we know at the ATF stinks juice or a more destructive how he can but that's going to keep happening because of the decline in the ... even though that that's a\nWestern Europe 'cause it's off the hook as far as ... concerned that the Chinese relate to it again took a loss of sea ice because the the the ice age from\nBeing produced in the green in the area and you go that's the region where\nThe wait was Dr ... so that's that's what sort of a known fact and they think he's being incorporated peak was thinking and but again it's not mentioned by IPC say they don't talk about any changes in political ocean such\nBy some means the warming below one point five degrees then various other things one\nAnd so we don't have to think about the moment and that's the reason I ... in this thing is we we find a white just keep the warming down [laughter] than\nOther phenomena was ... and so we don't have to talk about so me being a straight instance won't happen because the sea ice retreat [noise]\nBut it's already retreated to the point where you're warming up the coast to face of the opposite it's a mentality of all basic complacency when you need a mentality of\nDie a primate ... warning to say look we've got to do things really\nYes seriously like we need a radical departure\nYes I mean we need one for two degrees because that's not going to be easy to to reach or old possible probably the one point five you know that's that's really requires\nUm something absolutely drastic ... but it's not it's not going to get you to go into this report Ricans rudely to continue our lives\nThat was professor Peter ... interviewed by Stuart Scott on October ... eleven twenty Eighteen on the United planet face and science initiative\nNext is professor Kevin ... interviewed by Amy Goodman on democracy now they spoke on October nine twenty a teen\nFlorida is preparing for the last\nA store and that's a new report from the United nations climate panel warns humanity has only a dozen years to mitigate climate change her face global catastrophe\nAnd five degrees Celsius including transitions in land use and transportation systems and the adoption of future technologies including removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere according to the report global net carbon emissions would need to fall by about forty five percent\nFrom two thousand ten levels too by twenty thirty and reach net zero around twenty fifty or for more we're joined by Kevin Anderson had he is professor of climate change leadership at the center for environment and development studies\nAt ...
