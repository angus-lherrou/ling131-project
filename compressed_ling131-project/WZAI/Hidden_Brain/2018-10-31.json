is one truth that has endured through the first two years of Donald Trump's presidency\nHe has kept the support of the core group of voters who propelled them into the White House [noise]\nThere's only one part in that finally someone that's not a pilot\nThe approval of these voters often white and often working class has meant the Republican Party as a whole has stayed loyal to Trump\nView Republicans running for high office can expect to win\nWithout the Trump base as Trump's himself once famously said\nI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters okay it's like a [noise]\n[noise] this week on hidden brain we explore two competing perspectives on Trump's supporters and their motivations one paints a sympathetic picture focusing on class divisions and economic pain\nThis is a group that feels belittled and ignored and you know what some level they write\nThe other is more critical race as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society I think Republicans are using it to their advantage [noise]\nIn the United states just currently professor of law at the University of California Hastings College of law she's also the author of the book white working class overcoming ... in America Joan welcome to read and write delighted to be here\nWe've heard a lot about the white working class since that twenty sixteen election I'm Wondering if you could paint a picture for me Joan of who you include in this group and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty years you need to find three different groups\nOne is the poor on within the median annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars that's the bottom thirty percent of Americans buy household income and then the top ... their professional manager of the elite is the top twenty percent by household income\nUm and I find that as top twenty percent in my household income with one college grad\nThe group that's being called the working class is the group in the middle it's the middle fifty three percent within median household income in the in the seventies that's the group that's called the working class although they actually are the middle class\nAnd also it shows that that guy needed to keep close to home in a small circle of friends and acquaintances who knew no she's not just the guy who sells toilets his social on her is not portable [noise]\n\nJones says blue collar families feel resentment not only to the people above them on the social ladder but sometimes to those beneath her she told me a personal story about her sister in law who comes from a blue collar background she walked at a daycare that's sort of low income families and she found herself getting frustrated with some of the mothers\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag for Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and hike I Can't even afford shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also ... she was very angry when the the she was in head start she was teaching in ... as a head start teacher some of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying white Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental\nThey're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as keeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty years straight whereas the poor are seen as kind of hard living drug sex rock and roll\nUm didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise] Mm\nJones says working class people have come to us you know government benefits and government programs are not for them when her own working class father in law started to suffer from dementia Jones suggested to her mother in law actually apply for some help\nHer reaction was striking [noise]\nBeen her reaction was oh I'm not even going to bother to ask the government doesn't care about hardworking people like us it just cares about the poor\nUm and in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they\nDeliver it to help and they deliver it quite efficiently but it was that was not her assumption you know it doesn't hurt job to know that it's the job of the people were designing the programs and all of the political elites\nTo make sure that Americans know that and they had seriously dropped the ball\nOne of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book\nIs that the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan and the outlook and people who are not so they're going to be people who are very much at home working in Washington or New York or working tomorrow in London or Shanghai\nBut there are also people in the u._k. and in the U.S while routed to the community in a way that's very different and in some ways they resent the people who are accustomed politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have\nSort of the same ties with the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there's there it does map on to class but breaks it and Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did\nI'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump but the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of GDP the twenty six hundred counties\nUncensored the people who voted both for brags it and for Trump where those people who are left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people\nWho have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nThey actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity in contrast to the professional managerial lead or more focused on individual achievement and self development\n[noise] when you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to the work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the extremes that your husband had with his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes the it's a it's a form of social display\nBut it's also a form of saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\n[noise] work it's what you do to support your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups\nBut the hard work is a matter of of of persevering and staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life\nUm elites are completely defined by their jobs you know what\nAm I I Am a lawyer I and a techie um this total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of\nSort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole life sucking up to each other and confused their jobs with their lives [noise]\n\nOoh\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many rather do people believe that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead\nOh is that in the book Joan this idea is a much more controversial idea among the white working class\nWhite going to college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course couch debt is wet quadrupled I'm In recent years so it's very risky\nTo start to go to college and many of them ultimately dropped out there's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from\nNon elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as a very very risky in addition that they they typically don't get in to the same colleges and social science studies show that\nUh if you give people an identical Scott's cool record and one from an elite family in one from a ... a white working class family the white working class family\nHas a kid has to actually be about three times as good as a delete family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jones says researcher sent out two sets of resumes to employers the resumes what identical except for one difference\nOne set off a blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music the other set off elite signals water polo classical music or Mr water polo got sixteen times the number of call backs as Mr country music\nSo you may go through all of this process encourage\nAll of this debt and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to use you may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway [noise]\nJune Williams argues that these class differences rooted not just an economic hardship but and psychological shame and cultural humiliation play out in politics when we come back we'll explore different theories about why the white working class tip the twenty sixteen presidential election Donald Trump\n\nI'm Shankar based on them and you're listening to hidden brain [noise] this is NPR\n\nI'm In the time most of the point coming up tonight at seven books that scare us what better time to talk about scary books than Halloween Jill\nLibrary and married friend Buckley from eight cousins bookstore bring us their favorite those stories creepy mysteries some dark tales by Roald Dahl and Stephen King the point tonight at seven on W. CIA [noise]\nSupport comes from you and from the town of ... with the artist shanty program along the walkway to the sea in Hyannis harbor featuring creations from Cape Cod artist and artisans artist applications for the twenty Nineteen season at arts Barnes Noble dot com and from our business sponsors\nSubsequent election which means to suggest then that it\nWas immigration that was explaining partisanship as opposed to vice versa\nLet's step back for a second and just paint a picture of how you've arrived at this thesis or ... you say that since two thousand the United states has absorbed in extraordinary number of immigrants and in some ways and will be very surprising if the sewage did not have a profound effect on politics\nExactly as states like California Texas we already are majority minority states meaning that the majority of the population are made up of\nOf people of color and most of whom are an immigrant descendents so the U.S census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do these families as you point out a calling for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of the friction intention that's the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public or the fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that\nIt for the average American voter you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected would walk polls show Morris uh half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants or a burden to us society and the slack majority saying that Latinos out to the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so\nJust like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence is\n[noise]\nDemographic shifts ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class [noise] these threats come in different forms [noise]\nEconomic threat as far as I'm concerned they're stealing\nWhat comes on the hill understand the threat of baseball's huge posed to the country and to them\nSo you have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have\nThese rapid demographic shift you also have views increasing feelings of threat among many white voters and simultaneously you also have a situation where one political party is seen as being more responsive to the anxieties of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really taken all of these multiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central message and theme that can really again mobilize their voters\nAnd the fact that their base is overwhelmingly white means that they can have a central message such as immigration\nThat can activate and mobilize their voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues\nThat they want to advocate for there's been some criticism that well this is a short term strategy and if they're gonna they're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen\nYou won't you looked at what happens in states as the demographics of states start to change so as the Latino populations in states starts to increase for example what do you find in terms of the behavior of white voters\n[noise] well what you typically see is that as the population of a Latino voters have increased you start to see the shift in the political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh\nThat would be consistent with the theory that immigration is explaining the voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote this book before the twenty sixteen elections so\nFor better or worse some would say that it was ... into the ... of the outcome but it was just remarkable to us that when we were putting together this this book and our analysis is that\nFrom all these different angles not just of you know um who white voters supported but also the kinds of policies that they favor that it was really just that immigration was such a strong and important predictor in all of these different\nA political outcomes that we were exploring and so I think that's where this idea that it was really this white backlash towards immigration\nThe political climate we live in today\n\nWhen we come back what ... does thesis about a white backlash means for politics and elections\nAnd you're listening to hidden brain I'm Shankar Vedantam stay with us this is NPR\nBack\nWe

and Donald Trump's presidential campaign\n[noise]\nThe time when there's so many pundits that Trump was running a campaign that was out of ...\nUh but but um anyway as your book shows he was actually running a campaign that was perfectly in touch with the anxieties of\nWhite voters that's right I think what ... Smith says that Trump was trying to attract all voters across the United states he knew exactly what demographic and what base he was speaking to and so again with these kinds of emotional appeals\nThat are tied to a specific group of individuals that pitch that message resonated as we all know now extremely well with his supporters and I think it was compounded also by the fact that we had eight years in Obama presidency and so it's immigration\nAlso tied in with the issue of race and this is why the subtitle of our book is immigration race and politics because the two things ... if they at least in the context of the United states they go hand in hand with one another and so you have\nEight years of the presidency of the first African American president in this country coupled with\nAt the specific campaign message of immigration a altogether tongue in a lot of that racial resentment that happened in that past eight years\nI think it just is what galvanized his campaign and his presidency\nSo one one disturbing implication from your thesis Morris says if we're heading to a situation where we have different political parties for people of color and people who are white or an an increasingly what this means is that our political divides become racial divide\nIndeed and that uh I one of the ah again more pessimistic outcomes of this research is that really you know race as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society [noise] but I think also Republicans willingly took on that strategy\nAnd are using it to their advantage clearly [noise] there's an interesting\nTension here it seems to me for both the Democratic party and the Republican Party you know we we alluded to this sometime earlier but what might be in the interest of each party in the short term might not be in its interests\nIn the long term can can you talk about that from the point of view of both the Democratic party in the Republican Party\nShore I mean for the Republican Party right now there are an overwhelmingly white party and as we know with the way demographics are shifting in the United states we're going to become increasingly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "Brewster", "day": "31"}
