I'm fascinated by coincidences and could listen for hours the stories about them but what is it that is so fascinating about these moments in life at the University of Chicago psychologist Nick Epley thinks he might have one answer he's the author of the book mind wise\nTo understand how ... thinks about coincidences I Need to take a moment and explain his broader work to you first at least book exam and how we read the mental states and intentions of other people [noise]\nThis is a remarkably useful skill luckily sometimes miss applied [noise] we sometimes attribute intention identity\nTo things that aren't even living [noise] especially when they're out of the ordinary for example we don't personify a sunny day but we give hurricanes a name Katrina Sandy Andrew [noise] after Hurricane Katrina\nThe mayor of New Orleans said God must be mad at America [noise]\nFor centuries people have described intention ... to natural forces [noise] we think storms droughts and north quakes must have a mind of their own this general tendency to explain behaviors in terms of purpose or one tenth or [noise] or meaning\nTurns out we live with other people who do have intentions and goals and foresight and planning and meaning behind their actions and so by and large that tendency to make those kinds of attribution to other people is a good way to learn about each other is a good way to explain why are the people that something in the past\nTo predict how they're likely to behave in the future but the problem with\nAny kind of good tool is that sometimes we use it a little too much and that's what happens in these cases where you're trying to explain the behavior of something that doesn't really have\nA sensible explanation for some random event some chance occurrence some physical anomaly some weather pattern or that crops up that might not in fact have have a mind behind that\nThis is why we're fascinated by robots that move in unpredictable ways\nWhat we found was that when people were given a description of an object that made it sound unpredictable\nLike you couldn't anticipate its actions\nThat when people described it or reported that have had more mental states they were more willing to say that the object has a mind of its own that it has intentions for instance and I don't think this is totally counter intuitive that that is a mind if you if you see for instance uh billiard ball sitting on a table\nAnd other ball comes along and hits it and that ball rolls often they're predicted direction where you don't you don't need anything to explain that but if you've got a ball sitting on the table and suddenly starts rolling around randomly\nWell then you've got something to explain and in these cases\nSometimes people look to the inside of an agent give it a mind maybe the ball is possessed\nMaybe there is a demon controlling it a moving it around the table sometimes people attribute a mind to something when it's not there but they do that as an effort to explain what's going on in this uh autonomous and this autonomous agent and they're more likely to do that when an age of ... somewhat unpredictably\nI was over at a friend's house and uh my friend has a wonderful pool and um he had set the\nThis underwater Roomba for the lack of a better time to clean the bottom of the pools as it rolls around the bottom of the pool and it goes into completely random fashion right so just runs a couple of hours of cleaning the bottom of the pool and\nI find myself fascinated just watching it because the fact that you can't predict what it's going to do next makes it just more interesting and more I live in a way than something that moves in a very predictable fashion\nAbsolutely something that moves robotically very predictably that is just a mindless\nNormally well now wants to go over there a little bit not wants to move over here and now it\nRealizes that didn't clean that side of the pool over there are things that we have randomly start to get a little sense of a mind that people are crazy you don't you don't think it's like your mother writer or your your your uh you know your spouse whose vacuuming\nOr the living room but it starts to look just a little bit more mindful in fact the rumors are good example people\nActually do name that ... you can buy outfits to dress it up\nOr if you Google this uh online you'll find all kinds of examples of people thinking of their room buzz having perhaps a little bit more of a mind than it really does I Want to\nTalk to you a little bit about the subject of coincidences and I thought of you and your work because it feels to me that when something unusual happens to us and we stopped and we say\nThat is weird I was just reading this word in a book a second ago and someone in the room around me mentions the very same word and and it makes you stop and look up just like I stop and look at that underwater Roomba\nAbsolutely that's a case where something unusual happened was unpredictable and you try to explain it you can explain these kinds of random coincidences in lots of different ways there are lots of different kinds of causal structures we might be able to put on it\nUm but some of them involve giving it more meaning that it actually has\n[noise] this is what underwater ... have to do with coincidences [noise] like a robot that does something unexpected coincidences crowd for meaning or explanation because they are out of the ordinary we stopped to see patterns even when there aren't any\nMy favorite example of this in the world of psychology there's actually phenomena first documented by my PHD advisor Tom Gilovich\nBut there are times when falling in love with ourselves with people who remind us of our cells can be a real problem [noise] referendum is a professor of psychology at Montgomery College in Maryland you study something called implicit eco tourism which\nIs the idea that many biased these are unconscious and one very well studied bias was you get to some value in the cell favorably protecting the self and so forth and so we simply got the idea that there's several different things that at least to some degree reflect the preference for the self an attraction to things that resemble the self\nLike having an affinity for someone with the same but stay or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo off your name\nWe originally looked at whether people name Denis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry but we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great director ease of medical professionals there is a guy named able who was able to document that was a review on this paper and I was ...\nYeah a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer gravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples Brecht looked at a massive database of millions of Americans names from the recently released Nineteen forty cents is to examine if they were brought patterns like\nCarpenters working in carpentry bakers working as bakers butchers working as butchers\nMiners working as minor masons workings makes them so we looked at every surname there is a currently at the top two thousand surname that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're laughing at them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forties census with something like a\nI think it's a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to say of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be carpenters is that the name carpenter probably originated from families who were in carpentry and so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both the names and the choices quite\nPossibly but if you do the math you pretty quickly say it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people so if you assume that even over ten generations there's a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did and a fifty percent chance that you did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality you're talking about a a probability of less than one thousand\nAlready over ten generations in other words surname are so old\nAnd they change hands you know when a woman named carpenter Marin County farmer for example that that's really it really just can't account for and in fact anywhere near this magnitude\n\nRent them as looked at large data sets and public records that the Social Security death index or state marriage\nRecords databases with information about millions of Americans and he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds of funny effects like for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different months this isn't as on communist you might think\nBeyond what you might expect by me a chance there's about seven percent biased in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that if that doesn't sound like a lock your rights\nIt's a tiny invisible nudge it won't shave for everyone does all the time but it does shape what some people do some of the time it's when you multiply these smaller effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples read says that if you really love your birthday the effect gets even larger\nOr operational definition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number so if you got married on the thirteenth of the month you were quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number Thirteen as his birthday number\nAgain Brett calls this an implicit bias for a reason you may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names and our butts days and have positive associations with them\nAnd so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that and the the best bit of evidence I have but I've never bothered to publish is there's one part of people's names I don't like that much\nAnd that's their middle names you know the the joke about that is the sole purpose of a child's middle name it's a no when he was really in trouble and my additional come as no if he might be a serial killer someday right in the middle name is not nearly as love this the first or the last name people feel very ambivalent about their middle name\nThey can be other reasons for ambivalence sometimes we dislike it with another person has the same but if you were born on April twentieth you might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day to\nRectify and said if a consumer product happens to have your name on it but as poorly belt you are more likely to have that product people dislike seeing something inferior in the world that has that name on it\n[laughter]\nAs Britain and I were talking I realized something a little uncomfortable that I myself had fallen prey to him that he got his you know as as you're talking right now I'm realizing something about myself for the very first time there is a there was a philosopher in India whose name was ...\nMy name and he actually taught a philosophy that is known as ... and I've always being drawn to the fact that\nI find the philosophy of event that it'd be very interesting and the fact that Shankar I taught that philosophy I thought was just charming but now as I'm\nListening to you say this I'm realizing that this could just be implicit equal\nI've read his work very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think in your jak decision\nAnd if you think though that absolutely yes has this ever happened to you ... do you ever think about yourself in that ecosystem is affecting we're getting a little personal here but uh I I I Can't resist being a little bit personal I Would say the probably the most dramatic example is that my son Matthew\nI'm his his last things Poland his mother's last name was pulling my last name as Pelham\nAnd I entered a relationship with her before I developed this not after I developed a theory to validate the so Europe has them and you got into a relationship with a woman named polling Poland\nAnd we are very different in most other ways that's about as much as I said are you saying that the names played some kind of a role I I have to think it did I have to think and we were from different backgrounds different um different religions I mean where we come from very different worlds and yet I was very attracted to her\nWhere she had she was attracted to me right yeah [laughter]\nSo I and I understand why you would sort of called this charming and I think if you do this work for a while\nThere is a certain smiled at comes to your face as you sort of look at these connections and you sort of see you you understand sort of the choices that human beings make but I Do think there's something disturbing about it because I think\nThere is a very strong sense that I think most of us have I have the sense even though I've been covering the world of the unconscious mind for the last ten years I have the sense that my choices I deliberate choices that I thought about that my ... and making them intentionally and the idea that you're coming in and telling me that they have these hidden factors\nThat come in and change how I think about myself it is a disturbing idea it is a little bit disturbing and of course most people do what you and I do what you said well of course that applies to the rest of all but I in particular but never fall prey to\nRe implicit racial bias or implicit he gets as I'm so most of us do tend to sort of separate ourselves from even our own findings but I've become in the past decade or so comfortable enough of the study that I have to\nAdmit that I really never know for sure\nExactly why did something I mean sometimes I have a pretty good idea\nBut I don't I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know what why and do what I Do I mean there's just too much research ... much of what you've documented in reporting on that show that buys these were completely unaware of no just sometimes powerfully drive us in very\nParticular direction so I think I've just kind of let go of it ... it was disturbing to me when I first began to study it disturbing is well delightful and now it's become more delightful unless disturbing\n[noise]\nHow does any of this matter [noise] who cares if people born on the twenty third of September married those born on the twenty third of July\nWho cares if someone named Betsy carpet gravitates to what's carpentry why does it matter if I prefer a philosopher whose name is similar to my own\nThat at least raise is tough questions about the degree to which we have free will so I think some people who have pretty negative reactions to this work are very threatened by it and the sense that it suggests that very important decisions\nHave at least a little note edging influence\nUm based on things that you're completely unaware of so people are more likely than they should be by chance to marry another person who happens to share their birthday number that's not an objectively great reason to get married you should get married 'cause you shared values you're both Republicans you're both rabid Marxist\nBut learning that these subtle little influences can affect what you do\nA apparently to some people ... I find it delightful but some people might find it pretty threatening I don't think that it proves that there is no such things free well but it to me it does suggest that we don't always have free will sometimes we make a decision", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "14"}
