meeting someone with the same name the same birthday maybe you've gone on vacation to some far flung look how I met someone who lives down the street from you know many of us are drawn to coincidence is like this they make us wonder\nHow would the world that that happened when does it mean\nToday we explore a deep fascination with these moments of serendipity new research suggests they reveal important things about how our minds work and they have a far more powerful effect on our lives than any of us imagine\nA couple of months ago we are hidden brain listeners to share coincidences to date experience lots of people called in with amazing stories within those stories we found two that themselves formed a coincidence\nFell I was a student at the University of Rhode Island and we were in the writing class\nThis is Amanda butch\nShe was talking to the teacher of her writing class and the teacher mentioned that she lived in a small town in Vermont [noise]\nThe same small town and it turned out where to mend his mother had gone to\nThe teacher asked Amanda what her mother's maiden name was and Amanda told her\nShe just kinda dropped or pan and she goes you're not going to believe that but I live in the house or your mother grew up\nThe other listener who called us ... she called us in a scratchy phone line from Paris Sarah's an American but it's been living in France\nFor several years she was at a house party and someone told her that there was another American in the room so she went over to say hello they started talking and\nSo it turns out that party in Paris or either\nWatching on the roads we thought we might find out on today's show was talking about the mathematics of coincidences and why we find them so intriguing we'll talk today with a story about a whisper which is an app that allows users to connect anonymously online\nPeople can post that secrets on the site and strangers can respond with their own whispers the messages are short about the length of a tweet and they range from the silly\nHappy [laughter] definitely I just want to give me the way I can talk to the very serious and wash and I went to cheat on me\nAnd talk to tell us a story about an interesting coincidence that happened on that site Lauren Hudson is twenty seven and she turned to whisper at one of the darkest moments of her life\nSo Joseph ... can wrap his head around what happened to John ... but there are some coincidences that just defy mathematical interpretation Jews have told me one of his favorite stories about uh nineteenth century French poet

I'm fascinated by coincidence is and could listen for hours to stories about them but what is it that is so fascinating about these moments in life at the University of Chicago psychologist Nick Epley thinks he might have one answer he's the author of the book mind wise\nTo understand how ... thinks about coincidences I Need to take a moment and explain his broader work to you first [noise]\nAt least book exam and how we read the mental states and intentions of other people [noise] this is a remarkably useful skill sometimes miss apply it we sometimes attribute intention identity to things that aren't even living [noise]\nEspecially when they're out of the ordinary for example we don't personify a sunny day but we give hurricanes a name Katrina Sandy Andrew [noise] after Hurricane Katrina\nThe mayor of New Orleans said God must be mad at America\nFor centuries people have described in ... to natural forces we think storms droughts and earthquakes must have a mind to stay around\nGeneral tendency to explain behaviors in terms of purpose or intent or or meaning is ...\nTurns out we live with other people who do have intentions and goals and foresight and planning and meaning behind their actions and so by and large that tendency to make those kinds of attribution to other people is a good way to learn about each other as a good way to explain why are the people did something in the past\nTo predict how they're likely to behave in the future but the problem with\nAny kind of good tool is that sometimes we use it a little too much and that's what happens in these cases where\nYou're trying to explain the behavior of something that doesn't really have\nA sensible explanation for some random events some chance occurrence some physical anomaly some weather pattern or that crops up that might not in fact have have a mind behind that\nThis is why they're fascinated by robots that move in unpredictable ways\nWhat we found was that when people were given a description of an object that made it sound unpredictable\nLike you couldn't anticipates its actions\nThat's when people described it or reported that have had more mental states they were more willing to say that the object has a mind of its own that it has intentions for instance and I don't think this is totally counter intuitive that that is a mind if you if you see for instance uh billiard ball sitting on a table\nAnd other ball comes along and hits it and that ball rolls off and that predicted direction and what you don't you don't need anything to explain that but if you've got a ball sitting on the table and suddenly starts rolling around randomly\nWell then you've got something to explain and in these cases sometimes people look to the inside of an agent give it a mind maybe the ball is possessed maybe there's a demon controlling it a moving it around the table sometimes people attribute them on to something when it's not there but they do that as an effort to explain what's going on\nIn this uh autonomous in this autonomous agent and they're more likely to do that when an age of behave somewhat unpredictably\nI was over at a friend's house and uh my friend has a wonderful pool and um he had set the\nThis underwater Roomba for the lack of a better term to clean the bottom of the pool so that rules around the bottom of the pool\nAnd it goes into completely random fashion right so just runs a couple of hours of cleaning the bottom of the pool and I find myself fascinated just watching it because the fact that you can't predict what it's gonna do next makes it just more interesting and more I live in a way than something that moves into very predictable fashion\nAbsolutely something that moves robotically very predictably that is just a mindless\nLike your mother writer or your your your uh you know your spouse whose vacuuming or the living room but it starts to look just a little bit more mindful in fact the rumors are good example people\nActually do name that ... you can buy outfits to dress it up or if you Google this uh online you'll find all kinds of examples of\nPeople thinking of their room buzz having perhaps a little bit more of a mind than it really does I Want to\nTalk to a little bit about the subject of coincidences and I thought of you and your work because it feels to me that when something unusual happens to us and we stopped and we say\nThat is weird I was just reading this word in a book a second ago and someone in the room around me mentions the very same word and and it makes you stop and look up just like I stop and look at that underwater Roomba\nAbsolutely that's a case where something unusual happens was unpredictable and you try to explain it you can explain\nThese kinds of random coincidences in lots of different ways there are lots of different kinds of causal structures you might be able to put on it um but some of them involve giving it more meaning that it actually has\n[noise] this is what underwater ... have to do with coincidences [noise] like a robot that does something unexpected coincidences crowd for meaning or explanation because they are out of the ordinary we stopped to see patterns even when there aren't any\nMy favorite example of this in the world of psychology is actually phenomena first documented by my PHD advisor\nEsteem but there are times when falling in love with ourselves with people who would remind us of our cells can be a real problem [noise] referendum as a professor of psychology at Montgomery College in Maryland [noise] he studied something called implicit equal to ... which\nIs the idea that many biased things are unconscious and one very well studied biased was you get to some value in the cell favorably protecting the self and so forth and so we simply got the idea that there's several different things that at least to some degree reflect the preference for the self an attraction to things that resemble the self\nLike having an affinity for someone with the same but stay or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo off your name\nWe originally looked at whether people named tennis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry\nBut we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great director ease of medical professionals there is a guy named able who was able to\nDocument that was a review on this paper and I said no every time you say this I'm going to just jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr\nOr whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer gravitated toward those two professions there are lots of ...\nDatabase of millions of Americans names from the recently released Nineteen forty cents is joy examine if they were brought patterns like\nCarpenters working in carpentry bakers working is Baker's butchers working as butchers\nMiners working is minor masons workings masons that we looked at every surname there is a currently the top two thousand names that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're eleven to them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forties census with something like a\nI think it was a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to say of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters\nBe carpenters is that the name carved into probably originated from families who are in carpentry and so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both names and the choices quite possibly but\nIf you do the math you pretty quickly say it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people so if you assume that even over ten generations there is a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did and a fifty percent chance as he did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality you're talking about a a probability of less than more than a thousand\nAlready over ten generations in other words surname are so old\nAnd they change hands you know when a woman named ... county farmer for example that that's really it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near this magnitude\n\nRent them as looked at large data sets and public records like the Social Security death index or state marriage\nRecords databases with information about millions of Americans and he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds of funny effects like for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different months this isn't as uncommon as you might think\nBeyond what you might expect by me a chance\nThere's about a seven percent bias in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that if that doesn't sound like a lot you're right you should think of them ... as a tiny invisible nudge\nIt won't shape what everyone does all the time but it does shape what some people do some of the time\nIt's when you multiply these smaller facts over hundreds of millions of people that you start to\nSays that if you really love your birthday the effect gets even larger\nOr operational definition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number so if you got married on the thirteenth of the month you are quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number Thirteen as his birthday them\nAgain Brett calls this an implicit bias for a reason you may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse\nOr your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names in our butts days and have positive associations with them\nAnd so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that uh and the the best bit of evidence I have but I've never bothered to publish is there's one part of people's names I don't like that much\nAnd that's their middle names you know the the joke about that as the sole purpose of a child's middle name it's a no when he was really in trouble and my additional come as no if he might be a serial killer Sunday right in the middle name is not nearly as love this the first or the last name people feel very ambivalent about their middle name\nThey can be other reasons for a living it's sometimes we'd just like it when another person has the same birthday if you were born on April twentieth you might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day to\nRectify instead of a consumer product happens to have your name on it but as poorly belt you are more likely to hate that product people dislike seeing something inferior in the world that has that name on it\n[laughter]\nAs Britain and I were talking I realized something a little uncomfortable\nThat I myself had fallen prey\nTo ... you know as as you're talking right now I'm realizing something about myself from the very first time there is a there was a philosopher in India whose name was ... my name and he actually taught a philosophy that is known as ... and I I've always being drawn to the fact that\nI find the philosophy of aid that that would be very interesting and the fact that Shankar I taught that philosophy\nI thought was just charming but now as I'm\nListening to you say this I'm realizing that this could just be implicit eagle\nI've read has worked very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think you have like a decision\nAt the same time it does make you think though that absolutely yes has this ever happened to you ... do you ever think about yourself and you go to them is affecting we're getting a little personal here but uh I I I Can't resist being a little bit personal I Would say that probably the most\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org not after I developed a theory to validate the so so you're a ... and you got into a relationship with a woman named\nPulled them Poland and we are very different in most other ways that's about as much as I said are you saying that the names played some kind of a role I I have\nTo think it did I have to think and we were from different backgrounds different um different religions I mean where we come from very different worlds and yet I was very attracted to her\nAnd her where she had she was attracted to me right yeah [laughter]\nI said I and I understand why you would sort of called this charming and I think if you do this what for a while\nThere is a certain smile that comes to your face as you sort of look at these connections and you sort of see you you understand sort of the choices that human beings make but I Do think there's something disturbing about it because I think\nThere is a very strong sense that I think most of us have\nI have the sense even though I've been covering the world of the unconscious mind for the last ten years I have the sense that my choices I deliberate choices that I thought about that my ... and making them intentionally and the idea that you're coming in and telling me that they have these hidden factors that come in and change how I think about myself and he's a disturbing idea\nIt is a little bit disturbing and of course most people do what you and I do what you said well of course that applies to the rest of all but I in particular but never fall prey to re implicit racial bias or implicit he gets as them so most of us do tend to sort of separate ourselves from even our own findings but I've become in the past decade or so comfortable enough for the study that I have to\nAdmit that I really never know for sure\nExactly why I did something I mean sometimes I have a pretty good idea\nBut I don't I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know what why do what I Do I mean there's just too much research ... much of which you documented in reporting on that show that buys these were completely unaware of no just sometimes powerfully drive us in very\nParticular direction so I think I've just kind of let go of it ... it was disturbing to me when I first began studying the serving as well as delightful and now it's become more delightful unless disturbing\n[noise]\nSomehow you're wondering how does any of this matter who cares if people born on the twenty third of September married those born on the twenty third of July [noise]\nWho cares if someone named Betsy carpet gravitates to what's carpentry why does it matter if\nThey at least raise is tough questions about the degree to which we have free will so I think some people who have pretty negative reactions to this work are very threatened by it and the sense that it suggests that very important decisions\nHave at least a little note edging influence um based on things that you're completely unaware of so people are more likely than they should be by chance to marry another person who happens to share their birthday number\nThat's not an objectively great reason to get married you should get married because you shared values you're both Republicans you're both rabid Marxist\nBut learning that these subtle little influences can affect what you do\nA apparently to some people ... I find it delightful but some people find it pretty threatening I don't think that it proves that there is no such things free well but it to me it does suggest that we don't always have free will sometimes we make a decision", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "17"}
