order to present asked when Arabs\nWe begin with a story from the early Eighteen hundreds when the newspaper business in New York City was bleak the New York times\nWasn't around yet but there weren't a handful of other papers the journal of commerce the morning career in New York and choir they typically charged six cents a copy which was a lot of money in those days\nBenjamin day was working a newspaper printing and he thought the business model needed a ... six cents was way too much he decided to start his own paper the New York sun and sell it for one said\nEveryone thought he was crazy but he knew something that they didn't his strategy was one that Jeff Bass us from Amazon could appreciate\n[noise]\nWhen I was twenty fifth eighty and thirty five [noise] the New York son ran a front

upon their backs and uh apparently a ferocious sexual appetite\nObviously the paper was pedaling fake news but that's only obvious to us and the twenty first century of one man to the average person in Eighteen thirty five the discovery of mood batch was incredible and for the New York sun\nIt carry the paper to an rivaled levels of circulation\nColumbia University law professor Tim ... who has written a book titled the attention motions where he recounts the history of the many ways our attention has been hijacked by setting the newspaper for a penny Benjamin day captured market share and this turned out to produce something much more valuable than you sprint\nYork Sun which published these stories was the first paper\nTo run entirely on the harvesting of human attention but we also called advertising\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support double UCI at Cape and islands dot org\nAttention as something very valuable that you could resell make a lot of money out of and that's why I think the paper was driven to stories such as discovering life on the moon so it could build a circulation Benjamin based business model was a profound discovery\n\nThat model is alive and well today attention is to feel that allows everyone from candy makers to car dealers to sell their wares in fact the tension is so powerful that once you have that you can get people to buy things they didn't even know they need it\nLike for example mouthwash [noise] in the Nineteen twenties Listerine came up with one of the first example is there something Tim cause demand engineering [noise] it was an advertising campaign built around an unfamiliar word how to tell us\nThis dreaded condition the claimed makes you want popular\nYeah well you know I don't think people thought much about a with a head bad breath or not or before the Nineteen tens of Nineteen twenties\nOr in an era a new form of advertising was essentially invented which the goal of which was the engineer demand that did not already necessarily exist it was seen as a scientific process are done by professionals\nAnd are necessary to support new products that might otherwise not sell a mouthwash being one of them a tooth brush a toothpaste the being another people didn't necessarily want them uh the key there is that you could take human attention\nYou know what you've harvest it to some extent and then to transform it or spin into gold by engineering new demands and that was the magic or the science of advertising in Nineteen twenty to make people want things they didn't otherwise what\nCertain I understand that Listerine sales grew from a hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars to over eight million dollars as a result of this advertising campaign\nThat that's right and they're abundant examples from the Nineteen uh ten stickler early Nineteen twenty of them in engineering working\nAnd that is what powered frankly to the growth of something called an advertising industry which before had really been a marginal industry I'm In Listerine to take a sip example had\nPreviously been used for unclear purposes it had been in disinfectant that have been sold us something to clean floors with but the invention of it as a milk washed a clear to cure bad breath was the key to success [noise]\nThe attention much into the Nineteen twenties discovered that they could not only create new norms\nThat\nNight but I mean\nBut they could undo old ones one of the most effective campaigns was to undermine the taboo against women smoking\nIt was a considered unseemly or a taboo for a woman to smoke in public\nOr even smoke at all and uh the tobacco industry particularly lucky strike took aim of that in two directions\nOne was to try to brand cigarettes as a symbol of women's independence and co brand it with a separatist movement they invented this phrase torches a freedom for the cigarette to show that women do in charge of their own destiny and the second which is a well tried advertising technique\nWas to link uh cigarettes to weight loss others lucky strike's advertising to the era that picture enormous fat women into the few in five years that smoke lucky strikes or rich for lucky not for a sweet so they um [noise] I certainly wouldn't right at it and the the the statistics are are traumatic\nOr they went from very little sales to uh many millions of cartons being sold to women specifically and so I I think it's more the most successful examples advantage near\nThe night out but I Need to relax [noise]\nNinety years ago you might have heard that lucky strike jingle through a new medium that was taking America by storm\n[laughter] really didn't just captured people's attention

we're talking with author Tim Wu about his book the attention margins the ethics scrambled to get inside our heads attention much inside television shows newspaper articles and podcasts that draw you in and then sell your attention to advertisers [noise]\nNow now you know you're being asked to on the Internet\nHas redefined the notion of what and who and attention much it can be you don't need to be a fortune five hundred company or an advertising behemoth you can be someone like Jonah Peretti in two thousand and one the MIT grad student had an idea\nHe decided to order some personalized Nike sneakers would the word sweatshop printed on that\nMake you didn't really take a to that suggestion that they rejected that are still employed as inappropriate slang\nHe wrote back and pointed out that sweatshop wasn't flying that it was in the dictionary and uh uh they just cancel the order and he wrote a final email saying well you know could you please send me a picture of the a twelve year old who's making my shoes\nHe also went on to write a blog post about his experience or shared this material at described to me what happened and answered at the turn of events that tone this you know relatively innocuous private interaction into something that was close to a global phenomenon\nWell Jonah Peretti was a ... he was in the early to thousands and\nHe would heat touched a live wire but no one really understood well which was the tendency of certain stories I don't know for quite a blog post I think he just sent an email out\nAnd the email or got forwarded got forwarded got four were to go forward until millions of people who had seen it or read it but we now call that going viral but that phrase didn't exist back then uh you know John that told me that ended up on the today show talking about sweatshops the thing blew up\nAnd you know that's something we're kind of more familiar with now but the time it was it was a new phenomenon especially you know an unknown person having their email just go viral and it showed that there was something new and unusual about this medium or the Web and the Internet\nTom to do several other things and in fact he had he he demonstrated that he had something of a knack for finding things that went viral uh described to us some of the ... most of us have visited that are the brainchild of Jonah Peretti\nYeah so so Jonah in some way the law to invent a are present\nOr something about vi relative fascinated him I think he just thought that experience with issues was\nSo strange and weird and unexpected or that you know he went back almost like a scientist to see if he could bottle that lightning or he founded to websites\nOr one was the Huffington Post but she cofounded with the other people including Huffington which was designed to use these sort of Web Techniques to to push a more left leaning a form of journalism\nAnd uh you know it was a tremendous success transform journalism or not all in good ways but did a but he even went further\nAnd uh went to the cure distillation of attention with a site name buzzfeed laboratories now known as buzzfeed the only goal of which was the pure harvesting of attention by creating viral stories and that ... has obviously transform Web content today as we know what\nI remember some time ago I was I was watching something that was forwarded to me by a friend and it showed a video that buzzfeed had posted where they had a watermelon sitting on a table and needs to people working at buzzfeed essentially wrapped rubber bands around the watermelon and they kept doing so until they were probably hundreds of rubber bands\n\nThe idea was of course it at some point the rubber bands would exert enough power and the watermelon to make the watermelon explode and and you sort of knew this was going to happen but you didn't quite know when I was going to happen\nAnd people like me sat and watched this video on for for I don't know how long it was it might have been even ten or twenty minutes and all this was of people was people putting rubber bands on a watermelon and throughout that process I found myself asking why is it that I just simply not able\nTo look away and in some ways it is an active genius to create to create contests like that\nYeah I I see the laboratories I think the laboratories are so important part of the original name is it just kept experimenting until they found stuff that for whatever reason\nJust grab people and wouldn't let it go watermelons ah with with rubber bands or maybe more obvious ones like cat photos or they just people kept coming back and ah you know I guess we know more about the human mind as a result of buzzfeed's experiment on us although\nI'm not really sure that we like what we found or at least we fight\nYou know aren't necessarily reading Tolstoy or something but are these strange things like that when you mention [noise]\n\nComment about Silicon Valley and ... and and the worth of companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook are they have in some ways become mass\nChairs not just of capturing or attention but monitoring where our attention goes and building products that cater to the drift off our attention talk about the the new attention much insane in some ways that norm is power over our lives\nYeah sure a big turning point in the history of humanity came at the end of the last century the last millennia when Silicon Valley\nAre headed by Google first really started to get into advertising and turn all the resources all the know how all the expertise of engineering and computer science to the art and science\nOf capturing as much attention as possible getting as much data as possible other people and reselling it to advertisers\nUm that has been a a change with profound consequences I think uh many or most of us are are hooked on one or more a online products are which are no more about us than anyone else and frankly are like this incredible supercomputer designed to to get as much\nResettle attention out of us as possible I I think this is something that goes beyond even what television or radio was capable\nDoing because they know so much more about if they know so much more about you your vulnerabilities are your desires and uh you know customized marketing it can really work and it's something we really need to watch it in the next to the next decade\nMakes celebrities come to understand that attention on line translates to money a I was reading a website the other day that it was describing the Indian cricket ... who has nearly Seventeen million Instagram followers\nAnd the article said that we're not totally makes half a million dollars per Instagram post but he promotes a product that is just that's just mind boggling\n[noise] it does show the commercial value of attention which is really what my book is all about and it also speaks to the transformation of celebrity\nOr you know there was once a point or were famous people say the queen of England or a famous scientist they sort of tried to stay out of public view or either they they usually have jobs other than being celebrities say I don't know I was trying to discover things\nThe sense of wonder fame or that's not our model at all um celebrities or or aspiring celebrities seek to eke out any minute or second they can get a of our attention\nAnd stay there are never go away and uh as you suggested there's commercial reasons to do so that you can or frankly make a lot of money not only doing your job but just by being famous nothing maybe Paris Hilton because some credit for the theory of just being famous for being famous sick\nA famous for being famous as as the phrase but certainly a celebrity has transformed her time\nIt isn't just mega stars who can monetize that celebrity increasingly micro celebrities often called influence ours are finding there's real money to be made and harvesting the attention of
