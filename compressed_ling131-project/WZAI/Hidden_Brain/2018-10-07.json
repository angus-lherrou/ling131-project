I'm from Detroit Michigan\nBrandi drew has a story that may sound familiar to you a story of poverty and that is the kind of story that may lead people to quit conclusions so pay attention to euro Randy is now in her late thirties a few years ago her life unraveled at the time\nShe ran the dining services department at a senior living facility she been with a company that ran it for more than a decade one day\nShe made a mistake I was just in a rush to get home that was our because daycare close as I say I get off at five\nIt was like maybe a ten mile drive busy traffic area and I knew I had to pick up diapers and easiest thing for me I thought would be to pick 'em up a fire pit the baby up\nSurrounding stopped at a store run in and grab the diapers she's white took credit card at the self checkout station and reached out\nIt turns out she used the wrong card not her own by the company credit card\nBut what's crazy is I didn't realize at that moment I didn't realize it until my supervisor column in and said hey what's this purchase had she not said anything I don't think I Would have realized that\nRandy carry the card in case you needed to buy dining supplies for work should never had a problem before never been reprimanded she thought an apology and an explanation would do in her response was well you know we have\nTo terminate you know I'm like no I didn't know that like can I just pay you back it was only like twelve month\nAnd she said now in cases like that you automatically have to terminate them play\nI just cried and cried and like all day because I couldn't believe it I didn't want to go home and tell my\nKids what had happened and I didn't want to tell my husband what an ad and I just didn't know what to do at that point I found like a ... I felt like a failure as a parent because I didn't provide a a good example even though\nMistake brandy on more than her husband so the last of the job hit hard she felt like a loser she tried to bring in money doing odd jobs like cooking takeoff meals but the stress grew brandy and her husband began fighting sheets\nAnd she'd expect and he'd do the same for her but he found his situation was different [noise] he'd been laid off Randy was fired he was mad that she'd made a stupid mistake\nIs keeping them digit number on your head [noise]\nThere's a reason our minds with this way\nTunneling into something makes you focus on it everything in sight the tunnel becomes crystal clear the problem is you can't see anything outside of the time\nPeople in the poverty ... are actually very good at figuring out how to stretch the money they have to make it to tomorrow or the next week studies show that the poor tend to be better than the rich at knowing where you can find the best deals the G. tube of toothpaste\nSomeone who is poor as often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems how do I get food on the table today I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away like the utility bill or gas money or a credit card payment\nAs your as your checking the prices in a number and the prices and figure out if you took charge will you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things are paying less attention to your rent your kid's homework do the of the other things that make you know life completes\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll\nBe even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words\nIs attract the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJust as the poor focus on the money they do not have\nThe lonely tend to focus on the friends\nThey do not have the result\nIs they try too hard to be locked in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to what's actually being set the conversation\nFalters instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward are flat footed what happens as a result people avoid the composition of list and the only person becomes even lonely [noise] this lens\nOffers a new way of thinking about white people who find themselves in scarcity seem to do things that\nTo an outsider look stupid\nWhen you're in a whole why would you take yourself even deeper\nSend those says we're asking the wrong question what if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty\nMakes everyone less capable than it's the it's it's you and I tomorrow will be to become poor or with all of a sudden have the same effect the poverty is in some sense changing our minds\nHow do we know this isn't some bleeding hostility to excuse in responsible behavior and out in San Diego\nThis is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they are poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich\nSo how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugar cane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich but like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once the money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor\nSo now we have the same person a month before harvest poor in a month after harvest well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next ... tested the ... on the long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched other research that shows for example that farmers who are well off tend to read that feels more regularly and farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short to I'm thinking\nTo be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually knew or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely but they might be another former scarcity\nYou have experienced on some days that we get to leave that for pm some days we don't leave tell why am I [laughter] and then you start the next day at six in the morning I usually work\nEighty hours a week\nWhen we come back we'll find out how being overworked and exhausted can produce its own form of scarcity\nI'm Shankar based on them and you're listening to hidden brain from NPR\nIs all around us on the Cape Verde

believe that when something you're desperately need is in short supply your brain tends to focus on that thing this focus can be so intense that impede your ability to think about anything else\nWhat happens when the thing you're missing it's time when you're so busy it feels like you don't have time to brief\nLet me tell you the story of a young woman named Katie she asked us to use her middle name for reasons that will be clear in a moment\nFor as long as she can remember Katy has been driven really driven\nUm when I was in high school I was determined to be valedictorian so I took a sophomore level on our biology course as a freshman in high school and I studied around the clock I had no cards I walked through the hallways with a note cards if there was a holiday party I bought the new cards and I'd also studied until two or three in the morning\nShe says she wanted to be perfect at school she eventually got to medical school where she felt she graduated at the top of her class and quickly started a residency the newscasts\nThirty or six in the morning and you round on all your patience and then you you round with the team that means you go to all the patients and checking on their plan and adjust medications et cetera is necessary\nAnd then there's usually a lunch conference where we have education and then in the afternoon we might take new patients and and keep following up on our patients\nAnd on Sundays we get to leave at four pm some days we don't leave until one AM [laughter] and then you usually start the next day at five thirty or six in the morning and again [noise]\nUm and you get one day off a week usually work\nEighty hours a week as Judy's workload grew she started to feel she couldn't afford to waste a single moment instead of spending anytime relaxing she started to focus only on things directly related to her success at work\nWhen I first started it was just like really busy so I Try to come home and I felt like you know I just don't have a lot of hours so I Need to make the most of them and it was like okay I Need to make sure I'm exercising keeping my body healthy and they need to read and stay on top of things so I come home\nAfter pretty long day and I might go walking for half an hour and then I had read and then I go to sleep um but then as time went on I decided to try to get in more exercise\nThan like I never know and I'll get enough exercise and so I started spending all my free daylight hours\nWalking or running outside are going to the gym [noise] up to three hours a day plus like working Fifteen hours and trying to read and then go to sleep\nShe focused intensely on the things she believed was key to her professional success Judy lost sight of things on the periphery\nShe didn't know it but she was entering the tunnels scarcity in her case it was scarcity brought on by a lack of time\nSo I wasn't going to the grocery store and my house wasn't impact yet and it was stressing me how [laughter] it was just a mess and um [noise] I've my clothes piled up I had a lot of dirty clothes and\nIf it were tomorrow [noise] you know the answer is no you're declines the invitation\nBecause life is not going to be any less hectic two months from now [noise]\nPreserving bandwidth sticks conscious effort most of us are included are going to violate the rules will say yes to new commitments when we don't have the time or a lot of credit card when we can't afford it\nIn those moments it's important to look up\nTo notice we're inside the town [noise]\nAfter the break we're going to switch gears in move from scarcity [noise] to access\nIt turns out that having too much\nCan have its own set of problems when you're really wealthy it's not uncommon to have the experience that everyone is

rich\nTaking all of our for these talks in the Hamptons standardized testing hasn't really fast and I\nReally rich why are you wearing a tax cuts after six would I'm a farmer private jets your island the state of the Caribbean rich\nI mean it's one banana my what would it cost ten dollars\nMost of us would never know what that's like [noise] but if you've ever be at least a little curious about the lives of the labor wealthy this next segment is for you broke Harrington\nIs a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nHer strategy become a wealth manager Brooke discovered that\nWealth managers known a lot about the private lives of that clients\nAnd they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\n\nReal Cancun welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life give me some examples of the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager I Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins the series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me\nUm maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about there can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets\nPreferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable his mind is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSuicide already interesting because these professionals in some ways get to know that lions better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spouse\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nI understand you've conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book\nTo be a wealth manager you have to understand financial the law but this kind of wrote also calls for a certain psychological makeup but what kind of person becomes the wealth manager\nWill several to people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat joke in terms of social workers for the rich [laughter] so you you have to have a\nEmpathy and the desire to help people but also a very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seemed to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack 'em around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou write in your book about the extreme lengths that some managers go to please their clients or to provide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva who said that one of her clients once called her from outside a restaurant in London tell me that story\nSo this is one of the first stories that I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was a while I was training to be a wealth manager\nEleanor told this story over lunch of receiving a phone call from a client who was in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it and the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter]\nSo imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix a problem like this but Eleanor somehow did she she determine where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy to pay\n... there are some times ah clients do make request like this not because you're acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test the loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the clients said that he was in Japan and he was meeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed a desire for smoked salmon and that the client had promised him I think a thousand sides of smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon and David said on on your wealth manager not your fish monger and the clients I'd well today\nHappens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish\nAnd the client later told him I basically made up that story I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese fellow who wanted a thousand side to smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had the connections and the will to do what I wanted one I wanted and not ask any\nQuestions one thing that I got from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich are very much like the rest of us and ways in which they're not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have troubled marriages and we were children just like you know everybody else\n... but wealth you argue Ken compound those challenges\nWell apparently it's it's not uncommon for the wealth manager to be asked to find a recommend rehab facilities for kids or a parent will ask of wealth manager to break some bad news\nTo the next generation to to his or her own children sometimes the the wealth manager has to broker a truce between feuding family members say one family member feels that they've been done
