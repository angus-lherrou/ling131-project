I'm Shankar Vedantam we start today with an account of two communities one is liberal the other conservative\nI Want you to gas which is about [noise]\nThe schools with stress [noise] patriotism respect [noise] it would be a very rural face a educational system\nHow is this would be fairly similar the lawns would be a very nicely kept in a plea agreement mode or the town of the class of lots of churches that's down one [noise]\nHere's town to the schools would be based more on stereotypes are all kinds of things rather than than real memory\nPeople would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they lifted the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those and churches that was easy right\nConservatives like order liberals embraced ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to them so how did these two towns which I guess today refer to as liberal and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward explanation we use our upbringing in life experiences as a basis for a political beliefs we imagine that our parents teachers in friends shape our views on everything from taxes\nAnd the economy to immigration and national security but what if I told you there's something deeper to those attitudes drives that shaped the music we listen to the food we eat the politicians we elect\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences\nFrom biology [noise]\nOn a regular basis right before an election someone was shattered an article with me about how science proves\nThat the brains of liberals are stunted or post on Twitter was say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats [noise] these\nAnd far more accurate there are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences gave us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nJohn ... is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln he has spent many years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives he is co author of the book predisposed liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences\nMust be the way everyone else sees it and there's just this feeling of auto disbelief that other people might not see and hear the well the same way\nYeah it's just what we're used to it makes sense to us so I Do think that's something we need to continue to pound away on that that we really are wired up quite differently\nLet's look at how this plays out when it comes to the subject of immigration here's Republican Donald Trump\nThey're bringing drugs they're bringing crime their rapists and some\nI assume are good people and here's Democrat Nancy Pelosi\nWe are constantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming to our country their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream that you do that here in the first place [noise] strengthens ...\nNow it's important to stipulate here John that it's entirely possible these politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think you know immigration defense or police law and order I think that's really at the core of of who we are and a quarter of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us then it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president wants to\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know they only make sense does it can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place\nWill\nNow there are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the actual of political considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings\nJohn one showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted very differently\nPicture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by\nBy eating worms or children who are malnourished we have people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a electro journal activity or skin conduct tents which is a common way of seeing if somebody is just having a reaction having a physiological arousal to that a stimulus\nAnd what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of images because they're they have some emotional content but we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who was conservative\nThat is true that have been a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different and the one that we did a goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we had the\nMost luck with a pictures of mutilation ... uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people you know without knowing anything about them all of a good look at was the brain scan results [noise] and we could be incredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the basis of that\nLiberals brains when they looked at\nA mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the U.S to matter of sensory too\nAnd this is part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I take him in the ... century true with the active but it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of some of these stepping on a rough day now goes right through their ... just a matter of sensory too it'd be active\nAnd what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation Madison's for two and conservative\nDoesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted or just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents but my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics they shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different\nAnd about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you [noise]\n\nThere's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment I think about fraternal an identical twins identical twins have identical genes fraternal twins has similar\nBut not identical jeans if you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins each twin perished raised in the same household each ... each the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies now if you find differences between identical twins as a group\nAnd fraternal twins as a group\nThat suggest that biology non environment is the driver\nI asked John what such studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data set a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda needs\nA long ago it's fairly dated data set\nA but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views\nAnd when we subject these data to the standard twin design approach we did and did a fine that their political views were quite heritable um although people oftentimes misread this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views or come from a genetics but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science that many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was less genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent that comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic\nComponent is not in zero but apparently that was enough that at some people were upset about that [noise]\nAnd so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a closer laying in the political orientation of identical twins then in the political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put and and again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say\nOne of the big implications of all this this work uh besides just being interesting and then it's\nBut the political conflicts we have which fresh inside a and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we are able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talk to me about that idea John\n[noise] yes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handedness you know we used to think that uh if you were left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this was long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to write with his right hand so we do that as as a flaw something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left hand it is very biological this is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people uh realize that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just had decided to do\nA then people are much more tolerant of that\nSo we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather\nWhat oriented to the world and a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them that this was the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions what\nWould you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when we had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was often to the left of the more\nMost conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a sorting of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years\n[noise] would I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had\nThis very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats and think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and try new things\nAnd degradation of the Naga ration of Abraham Lincoln [noise]\nAnd Atlanta a newspaper and express what many were feeling in the country at the time southern states were starting to seat it was the eve of the civil war while the civil war brought liberty to an end David still thinks of this moment as an example of destructive\nConflict that's because the conflict wasn't resolved so the Democratic process but through the bloodiest war in American history\nIn a sense the southerners those who are are going to favor secession they're more committed to the institution of slavery and to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interesting that you didn't oppose slavery per se wasn't calling for\nThe slavery expand and that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in the science fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery they put that head\nOf the democracy so now the conflict justice sense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength that they can also be in a credible source of weakness\nAnd the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers been yeah at that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\n\nI'm Wondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually willing to say I believe\nVery strongly that I'm right but I Want to at least conceived the possibility\nThat maybe there are others who have something of value all me if maybe that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future I think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think that could be wrong there's this sense that if you believe in democracy so much there's only so far you're willing to go\nAnd so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family rights of family we have every family people fight the coral they disagree about all sorts of things but if there's loving the family the conflict only goes so far the love breaks down then actually the conflict convinced the family [noise]\n\nIn the
