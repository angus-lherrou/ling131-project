current politics in the United states there is one truth that has endured through the first two years of Donald Trump's presidency\nHe has kept the support of the core group of voters who propelled them into the White House [noise]\nThere's only one part in that finally someone that's not a pilot\nThe approval of the voters often white and often working class has meant the Republican Party as a whole has stayed loyal to Trump\nView Republicans running for high office can expect to win\nWithout the Trump base as Trump himself once famously said\nI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters okay it's like a crowded [noise]\nThis week on hidden brain we explore two competing perspectives on Trump's supporters and their motivations and one paints a sympathetic picture focusing on class divisions and economic pain\nIs a group that feels belittled and ignored and you know what some level they write\nThe other is more critical race as we all know is such a fundamental cleavage in our society I think Republicans are using it to their advantage [noise]\nJune William studies gender class and work in the United states just currently a

to be here\nWe've heard a lot about the white working class since that twenty sixteen election I'm Wondering if you could paint a picture for me Joan of who you include in this group and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty years you need to find three different groups one is the poor on within meeting annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars that's the bottom\nAnd then the top ... their professional manager of the elite is the top twenty percent by household income um and I find that as top twenty percent is by household income with one college grad\nThe group that's being called the working class is the group in the middle it's the middle ... fifty three percent with the median household income in the in the seventies that's the group that's called the working class although they actually are the middle class\nDo I do I'm a law professor that this form of social honor\n[noise] what the I sell toilets comment meant is that I'm not just the men who sells toilet [noise] don't just boil me down to my job my job is not who I Am\nAnd also it shows that that

families feel resentment not only to the people above them on the social ladder but sometimes to those beneath them she told me a personal story about her sister in law who comes from a blue collar background she walked at a daycare that's so low income families and she found herself getting frustrated with some of the mothers\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag for Macy's and she was furious because she felt you know she's on public assistance and she can shop at Macy's and hike I Can't even afford to shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also ... she was very angry when the the shoes in head start she was teaching and ... as a head start teacher some of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying\nWhite Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor\nAnd they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as keeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty or straight whereas the poor are seen as kind of hard living drugs sex\nRock and roll [noise] um didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise] Mm\nSays working class people have come to a few but government benefits and government programs are not for them when her own working class father in law started to suffer from dementia Jones suggested to her mother in law that you apply for somehow\nHer reaction was striking\nWell I'm not even gonna bother to ask the government doesn't care about hardworking people like us it just cares about the poor\nUm and in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they\nDeliver it to help and they deliver it quite efficiently but it was that was not her assumption you know it doesn't hurt job to know that it's the job of the people were designing the programs and of the political elites\nTo make sure that Americans know that and they have seriously dropped the ball\nOne of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book\nIs that the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan and the outlook and people who are not oh so they're going to be people who are very much at home working in Washington or New York or working tomorrow in London or Shanghai but there are also people in the u._k. and in the U.S while routed to the community in a way that's very different\nAnd in some ways they resent the people who will cost a politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same ties with the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there's there it does map on to class but brags it and Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did\nI'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump\nBut the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of GDP\nThat twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third the people who voted both for ... and for Trump were those people who are left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people\nWho have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nThey actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity in contrast to the professional managerial lead toward more focused on individual achievement and self development\nWhen you think about the ways a blue collar America and\nOr uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the extremes that your husband had with his former classmate in some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes the it's a it's a form of social display\nBut it's also a former saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\n[noise] work is what you do to support your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups\nBut the hard work is a matter of of of persevering and staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life\nUm elites are completely defined by their jobs you know what am I I Am a lawyer I and a techie\nUm this total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of\nSort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole life sucking up to each other and confused their jobs with their lives [noise]\n\nFor and\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many residue people believe that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead you need to get a good education but as you point out on the book Joan this idea is a much more controversial idea among the white working class white [noise]\nTo college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course college debt is what quadrupled I'm In recent years so it's very risky\nTo start to go to college or many of them ultimately drop out there's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from non elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as a very very risky in addition that they they typically don't get\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to

as the delete family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jones says researcher sent out two sets of resumes to employers the resumes what identical except for one difference\nOne set off a blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music the other set off elite signals water polo classical music or Mr water polo at sixteen times the number of call backs as Mr country music\nSo you may go through all of this process encourage all of this debt and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to use\nYou may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway [noise]\nJune Williams argues that these last differences rooted not just an economic hardship but in psychological shame and cultural humiliation play out in

that was explaining partisanship as opposed to vice versa [noise] let's step back\nFor a second and just paint a picture of how you've arrived at this thesis or ... you say that since two thousand the United states has absorbed in extraordinary number of immigrants and in some ways in will be very surprising if the sewage did not have a profound effect on politics\nExactly as states like California taxes we already are majority minority states meaning that the majority of the population are made up of of people of color and most of whom are\nUS Census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nWhile there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do use families as you point out a calling for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of friction intention that's the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public or the fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that\nIt for the average American voter you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected we'd walk polls show more as a half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants or a burden to us society and the slack majority saying that Latinos out to the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so\nJust like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence is\n[noise]\nRapid demographic shifts ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class [noise] these threats come in different forms [noise]\nEconomic threat as far as I'm concerned they're stealing draws political track\nWhy Republicans on the hill understand the threat of these policies posed to the country and to them\nSo you have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have\nThese rapid demographic shift you also have these increasing feelings of threat among many white voters and simultaneously you also have a situation where one political party is seen as being more responsive to the anxiety of white voters than the other\nOne that's right I think the Republicans have really taken all of these multiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central message in theme that can really again mobilize their votes\nOverwhelmingly white means that they can have a central message such as immigration\nThat can activate and mobilize their voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues that they want to advocate for\nThere's been some criticism that while this was a short term strategy and if they're gonna they're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen\nYou won't you looked at what happens in states as the demographics of states start to change so as the Latino populations in states starts to increase for example what do you find in terms of the behavior of white voters [noise] well what\nYou typically see is that as the population of a Latino voters have increased you start to see the shift in the political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh\nThat would be consistent with the theory that immigration is explaining the voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote this book before the twenty sixteen election so\nFor better or worse some would say that it was ... into the ... of the outcome but it was just remarkable to us that when we were putting together this this book and the our analysis is that\nFrom all these different angles not just of you know I'm cool white voters supported but also the kinds of policies that they favor that it was really just that immigration was such a strong and important predictor in all of these different\nA political outcomes that we were exploring and so I think that's where this idea that it was really this white backlash towards immigration that currently the political climate we live in today
