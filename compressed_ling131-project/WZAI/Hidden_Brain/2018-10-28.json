the drama of current politics in the United states there is one truth that has endured through the first two years of Donald Trump's presidency he has kept the support of the core group of voters who propelled them into the White House [noise]\nThere's only one part in that finally someone that's not a politician\nThe approval of disorders often white and often working class has meant the Republican Party as a whole has to be loyal to Trump\nView Republicans running for high office can expect to win\nWithout the Trump base as Trump himself once famously said\nI could stand in the middle and Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters okay it's like a crowded [noise]\nThis week on hidden brain we explore two competing perspectives on Trump's supporters and their motivations and one paints a sympathetic picture focusing on class divisions and economic pain\nThis is a group that feels belittled and ignored and you know what some level they write\nThe other is more critical race as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society I think Republicans are using it to their advantage [noise]\nJoan Williams studies gender class and work in the United states just currently professor of law at the University of California Hastings College of law she's also the author of the book white working class overcoming class ... in America Joan welcome to hit and bright\nDelighted to be here\nWe've heard a lot about the white working class since that twenty sixteen election I'm Wondering if you could paint a picture for me Joan of who you include in this group and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty years you need to find three different groups\nOne is the poor on within meeting annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars that's the bottom thirty percent of Americans buy household income and then that topped the professional manager of the elite is the top twenty percent by household income\nUm and I find that as top twenty percent in my household income with one college grad the group that's being ...\nIn the middle it's the middle fifty three percent within median household income in the in the seventies that's the group that's called the working class although they actually are the middle class\nWhat do I do I'm a law professor that this form of social honor [noise] what the I sell toilets comment men is that I'm not just the man who sells toilet and you don't just boil down to my job my job\nAnd also it shows that that I needed to keep close to home in a small circle of friends and acquaintances who knew no she's not the guy who sells ... his social on her is not portable [noise]\n\nJones says blue collar families feel resentment not only to the people above them on the social ladder but sometimes to those beneath her she told me a personal story about her sister in law who comes from a blue collar background she walked at a daycare that's sort of low income families and she found herself getting frustrated with some of the mothers\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag from Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and height I Can't even afford to shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also ... she was very angry when the the she was in head start she was teaching in ... as a head start teacher some of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid\nAnd they were making her late and they weren't paying\nWhite Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor\nAnd they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as keeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty years straight whereas the poor are seen as kind of hard living drug sex rock and\nRoll um didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise] Mm\nJones as working class people have come to us you led government benefits and government programs are not for them when her own working class father in law started to suffer from dementia Jones adjusted to her mother in law that you apply for somehow\nHer reaction was striking\nBeen her reaction was oh I'm not even gonna bother to ask the government doesn't care about hardworking people like us it just cares about the poor um and in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they deliver it to help\nThat was not her assumption you know it doesn't hurt job to know that it's the job of the people were designing the ... end of the political elites to make sure that Americans know that and they have seriously dropped the ball\nOne of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book is that the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan and their outlook and people who are not\nGoing to be people who are very much at home working in Washington or New York or working tomorrow in London or shine guy but\nThere are also people in the u._k. and in the U.S while routed to the communities in a way that's very different and in some ways they resent the people who are cosmopolitan because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same ties are the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there's there it does map on to class but breaks it and Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did\nI'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump\nBut the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of GDP\nThat twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third the people who voted both for brags that and for Trump where those people who are left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people\nWho have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nThey actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity in contrast to the professional managerial lead or more focused on individual achievement and self development\nWhen you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to their work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the extremes that your husband had with his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes it's a it's a form of social display\nBut it's also a former saying workers\nIt's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\n[noise] work it's what you do to support your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups\nBut the hard work is a matter of of of persevering and staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life\nUm elites are completely defined by their jobs you know what am I I Am a lawyer I and\nA techie um this total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of\nSort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole life sucking up to each other and confused their jobs with their lives [noise]\n\nFor oh\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many roasted do people believe that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead you need to get a good education but as you point out of the book Joan this idea is a much more controversial idea among the white working class white\nTo college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course coached at is what quadrupled I'm In recent years so it's very risky to start to go to college or many of them ultimately drop out there's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from\nNon elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as a very very risky in addition that they they typically don't get in to the same colleges and social science studies show that\nUh if you give people an identical school record and one from an elite family and one from a ... a white working class family the white working class family\nUsually be about three times as good as the elite family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jones says research were sent out two sets of resumes to employers the resumes what identical except for one difference\nOne set off um blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music\nThe other set off elite signals water polo classical music uh Mr water polo sixteen times the number of call backs as Mr country music\nSo you may go through all of this process encourage all of this debt and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to use\nYou may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway\nJoan Williams argues that these class differences rooted not just an economic hardship but in psychological shame and cultural humiliation play out in politics when we come back with explore different theories about why the white working class tip the twenty sixteen presidential election Donald Trump\nI'm Shankar Vedantam and you're listening to hidden brain [noise] this is NPR\n\nDaytime hosted the point coming up this week Tuesday

Bergen Dr Margaret Rothenberg our thanks to you and to all of our members for the general supportive your NPR station [noise]\nWhich means to suggest then that it was immigration that was explaining partisanship as opposed to vice versa\n[noise] let's step back for a second and just paint a picture of how you've arrived at this thesis or you say that since two thousand the United states has absorbed in extraordinary number of immigrants and in some ways in will be very surprising if the sewage did not have a profound effect on politics\nExactly as states like California taxes we already are majority minority states meaning that the majority of the population are made up of\nOf people of color and most of whom are an immigrant descendents so the U.S census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do these families is\nThe small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of friction and tension that's the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public or the fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that\nIt for the average American voter you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws and orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected would walk polls show Marissa half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants or a burden to us society and it's like majority saying that Latinos out to the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so\nJust like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence is\n[noise]\nRapid demographic shift ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class these threats come in different forms [noise]\nEconomic threat as far as I'm concerned they're stealing draws political threats\nWhy Republicans on the hill understand the threat of the policy as opposed to the country and to them\nSo you have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have\nThese rapid demographic shift you also have these increasing feelings of threat among many white voters and simultaneously you also have a situation where one political party is seen as being more responsive to the anxieties of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really taken all of these multiple factors into consideration\nAnd used it to capitalize on a central message in theme that can really again mobilize their voters\nAnd the fact that their base is overwhelmingly white means that they can have a central message such as immigration that can activate and mobilize their voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues\nIt's been some criticism that while this was a short term strategy and if they're gonna they're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen\n... looked at what happens in states as the demographics of states start to change so as the Latino populations in states starts to increase for example what do you find in terms of the behavior of white voters well what\nYou typically see is that as the population of a Latino voters have increased you start to see the shift in the political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh\nThat would be consistent with the theory that immigration is explaining the voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote this book before the twenty sixteen election so\nFor better or worse some would say that it was ... into the ... of the outcome but it was just remarkable to us that when we were putting together this this book and the our analysis is that\nFrom all these different angles not just of you know I'm cool white voters supported but also the kinds of policies that they favor that it was really just that immigration was such a strong an important predictor in all of these different\nA political outcomes that we were exploring and so I think that's where this idea that it was really this white backlash towards immigration that currently the political climate we live in today\n[noise]\nWhen we come back

in many ways your book shows you was actually running a campaign that was perfectly in touch with the anxieties of white voters\nThat's right I think what ...
