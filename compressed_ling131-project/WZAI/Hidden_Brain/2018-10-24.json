conservative\nI Want you to gas which is where [noise]\nThe schools with stress [noise] patriotism and respect [noise] it would be a very rural face an educational system\nHow is this would be fairly similar salons would be a very nicely kept and a fleet green and mode or the town of the class with lots of churches that's down one [noise]\nHere's town to the schools would be based more on experience all kinds of things rather than than real memory\nPeople would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films a more of those and churches that was easy right\nConservatives like order liberals embraced ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to that so how did these two towns which I guess today the first you as liberal and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward explanation we use our upbringing in life experiences as the basis for a political beliefs we imagine\nThat our parents teachers in friends shape our views on everything from taxes and the economy to immigration and national security but what if I told you there's something deeper to those attitudes drives that shaped the music we listen to the food we eat the politicians we elect\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences\nFrom biology [noise]\nA regular basis right before an election someone was shattered an article with me about how science proves that the brains of liberals are stunted or a post on Twitter was say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\n[noise] these claims obscure something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological difference is between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts John hitting as a political\nYeah it's just what we're used to it makes sense to us so I Do think that's something we need to continue the pound away on that that we really are wired\nAnd how this plays out when it comes to the subject of immigration here's Republican Donald Trump\nThey're bringing drugs they're bringing crime their rapists and some\nI assume are good people and here's Democrat Nancy Pelosi yeah constantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming to our country their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream that you do that here in the first ...\nNow it's important to stipulate you know John that it's entirely possible these politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think ah you know immigration defense or police law and order I think that's really at the core of of who we are not the quarter of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us and it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president wants to\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know the ... they only makes sense is if they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place\nWill\nNow there are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the actual of a political considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings\nJohn one showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted very differently a\nPicture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe had people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a electro journal activity or skin productions which is a common way of saying if somebody's just having a reaction having\nA stimulus and what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of images because they're they have some emotional content but we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive for the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who was conservative\nThat is true that have been a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different\nAnd the one that we did it goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we had the most luck with a pictures of mutilation ... uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people\nYou know without knowing anything about them all of a good look at was the brain scan results [noise] and we could be\nA incredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the basis of that\nLiberals brains when they looked at\nA mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the U.S to matter of sensory too\nAnd this is part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I take him in the ... century tree with the active\nBut it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of some of these stepping on a rusty now goes right through there but just a matter of sensory too it'd be active and what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation Madison's for two and conservative\nDoesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted or just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ...\nYou could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find are consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents but my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics they shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you [noise]\n\nA really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment thinking\nIdentical twins have identical genes fraternal twins have similar\nBut not identical jeans if you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins each twin Paris raised in the same household each ... each the same food listening to the same conversations watches the same movies now if you find differences between identical twins as a group\nAnd fraternal twins as a group that suggest that biology not environment is the driver\nI asked John what such studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data set a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda Neves how long ago it's fairly dated data set a but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views and when we subject these data to the standard\nTwin design approach we did indeed uh find that their political views were quite heritable [noise] um although people oftentimes mystery this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views come from a genetics but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science so many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was less genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic\nThat obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not in zero but apparently that was enough that at some people were upset about that [noise]\nAnd so you you basically you're able to tell in some ways that there is a loser laying in the political orientation of identical twins then in the political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say\nOne of the big implications of all this this work uh besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have\nWhich fresh inside a and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we are able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological [noise] it's\nThose differences talked about that idea John [noise]\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handed us you know we used to think that uh if you were left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this is long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to to write with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left handed is very biological this is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people are realized that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just had decided to do a then people are much more tolerant of that\nSo we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather what oriented to the world in a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them\nThat this was the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when we had many many more people in the center of the most liberal\nRepublican was often to the left of the more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a sorting of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years [noise]\nWhat I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had\nAnd degradation if you're not rationing Abraham Lincoln [noise]\nAn Atlanta newspaper express what many were feeling in the country at the time southern states were starting to the seat it was the eve of the civil war was the civil war brought celebrity to an end David still thinks of this moment as an example\nOf destructive conflict that's because the conflict wasn't resolved so the Democratic process but through the bloodiest war in American history\nA sense the southerners those who are are going to favor the fashion\nThey're more committed to the institution of slavery\nThan to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interestingly you didn't oppose\nSlavery per se wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand and that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand maintain political balance between free states\nAnd slave states they couldn't really tolerate\nOppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize he was elected in the science fair and square they just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery they put that head\nOf the democracy so now the conflict justice sense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength but\nThey can also be in a credible source of weakness and the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers but yeah at that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\n\nI'm Wondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually willing to say I believe very strongly that I'm\nRight but I Want to at least conceived the possibility\nThat maybe there are others who have something of that the all ... it may be that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future I think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think that could be wrong there's a sense that if you believe in democracy so much\nThere's only so far you're willing to go and so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family right so a family we you know ... every family people fight the coral they disagree about all sorts of things but if there's loving the family the conflict only goes so far the love breaks down than actually the conflict convict the family [noise]\n\nAnd the twentieth century the bonds of democracy what tested again when we come back the
