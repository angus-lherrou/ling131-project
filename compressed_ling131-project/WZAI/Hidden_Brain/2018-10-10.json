...\nGoing out how to stretch the money they have to make it tomorrow or the next week studies show that the poor tend to be better than the rich at knowing where you can find the best deals the cheap tube of toothpaste\nSomeone who is poor as often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems how do I get food on the table today I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away like the utility bill or gas money or credit card payment\nOf your of your checking the prices and remembering the prices and figure out if you buy two cards will you have enough money for breakfast you are for getting things are paying less attention to your rent your kid's homework deliver the of the other things that make you know life completes\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words\nIs attract the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even for their scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJust as the poor focus on the money they do not have\nThe lonely tend to focus on the friends\nThey do not have the result is they try too hard to be locked in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't be attention to what's actually being set the conversation falter instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward are flat footed what happens\nAs a result people do voice the ... and the only person becomes even lonely [noise] this lands\nOffers a new way of thinking about white people who find themselves in scarcity seem to do things that to an outsider look stupid when you were in a whole why would you take yourself even deeper center says we're asking the wrong question what if it's not\nThe poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty make everyone less capable that it's the it's\nUn I tomorrow will be to become poor or with all of us and have the same effect the poverty is and Simpsons changing our minds\nDo we know this isn't some leading Haass theory to excuse irresponsible behavior and on and send them wanted to test that hypothesis of all this\nPerson when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're bitch so how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugar cane farmers actually created a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich but like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once the money gets spent a little too fast\nAnd so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor and the month after her this well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next central and now that tested the farmers on their long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched other research that shows for example that farmers who are well off tend to read that feels more regularly and farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short I'm thinking\nTo be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually knew or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely but they might be another former scarcity\nYou have

send them a line up and believe that when something you desperately need is in short supply your brain tends to focus on that thing this focus can be so intense that impede your ability to think about anything else\nWhat happens when the thing you're missing is time when you're so busy it feels like you don't have time to brief\nLet me tell you the story of a young woman named Katie she asked us to use her middle name for reasons that will be clear in a moment\nFor as long as she can remember Katy has been driven really driven\nUm when I was in high school I was determined to be valedictorian so I took a sophomore level on our biology course as a freshman in high school and I studied around the clock I had no cards I walked through the hallways with the note cards if there was a holiday party I bought the new cards and I'd also studied until two or three in the morning\nShe says she wanted to be perfect at school she eventually got to medical school where she felt she graduated at the top of her class and quickly started her residency the new ... was grueling\nCan get in at five thirty or six in the ...\nAnd on all your patience and then you you round with the team that means you go to all the patients and check in on their plan and adjust medications et cetera is necessary\nAnd then there's usually a lunch conference where we have education and then in the afternoon we might take new patients and and keep following up on our patients\nAnd on some days that we get to leave at four pm some days we don't leave until one AM and then you usually start the next day at five thirty or six in the morning again [noise]\nUm and you get one day off a week usually work eighty hours a week\n... workload grew she started to feel she couldn't afford to waste a single moment instead of spending anytime relaxing she started to focus only on things directly related to her success at work\nWhen I first started it was just like really busy so I Try to come home and I felt like you know I just don't have a lot of hours so I Need to make the most of them and it was like okay I Need to make sure I'm exercising keeping my body healthy and they need to read and stay on top of things so I come home\nAfter pretty long day and I might go walking for half an hour and then I'd read and then I go to sleep um but then as time went on I decided to try to get in more exercise\nThan like I never know and I'll get enough exercise and so I started spending all my free daylight hours\nWalking or running outside are going to the gym [noise] up to three hours a day plus like working Fifteen hours and trying to read and then go to sleep\nAnd uh she focused intensely on to things she believed was key to her professional success Judy lost sight of things on the periphery\nShe didn't know it but she was entering the tunnel of scarcity in her case it was ... he brought on by a lack of time\nSo I wasn't going to the grocery store and my house wasn't impact yet and it was stressing me how

rich\nAnd all of our friends he talks in the Hamptons standardized testing has really come out\nReally rich why are you wearing a tax cuts after six what am I a farmer private jet to our island the state of the Caribbean rich\nI mean it's one and then what would it cost ten dollars\nMost of us would never know what that flight but if you've ever be at least a little curious about the lives of the Hoover wealthy this next segment is for you\nBroke Harrington is a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nStrategy become a wealth manager route discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth\nPrivate lives of that clients [noise]\nAnd they're very different set of rules that govern there were [noise]\n\nReal Cancun welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life give me some examples of the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager I Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins the series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me\nUm maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nThere can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets preferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSo it's really interesting because these professionals in some ways get to know that clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spouse\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nI understand you conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm telling me a little bit about the people you met to be a wealth managers\nWhen you contributed WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support double UCI at Cape and islands dot org joke in\nTerms of social workers for the rich [laughter] so you you have to have a empathy and a desire to help people but also a very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seemed to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack him around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou write in your book about the extreme lengths that some managers go to please their clients or to provide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva who said that one of her clients once called her from outside a restaurant in London tell me that story so this is one of the first\nStories that I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was\nA while I was training to be a wealth manager Eleanor told the story over lunch of receiving a phone call from my clients who lives in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it and the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter]\nSo imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix the problem like this but Eleanor somehow did it she she determine where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy to pay\n... there are some times ah clients do make request like this knock because the acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test the loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management\nHong Kong named David yes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the clients said that he was in Japan and he was\nMeeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed the desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand sides of smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon and David said well I'm I'm your wealth manager not your fish monger and the client said well today you're the fish longer and so David happens to know\nSmoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish\nAnd the client later told him I basically made up that story I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese fellow who wanted a thousand side to smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had the connections and the will to do what I wanted one I wanted and not ask any\nQuestions one thing that I got from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich are very much like the rest of us and ways in which they're not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have troubled marriages and we were children just like you know everybody else\n... but wealth you argue Ken compound those challenges\nWell apparently it's it's not uncommon for the wealth manager to be asked to find a recommend rehab facilities for kids or a parent will ask the wealth manager to break some bad news\nTo the next generation to to his or her own children sometimes the the wealth manager has to broker a truce between feuding family members say one family member feels that they've been done done by unfairly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "Brewster", "day": "10"}
