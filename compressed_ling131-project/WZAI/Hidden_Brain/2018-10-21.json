to us so thanks [noise]\n\nThis is hidden\nWe start today with an account of two communities one is liberal the other conservative\nI Want you to gas which is about [noise]\nThe schools with stress [noise] patriotism and respect [noise] it would be a very rural face an educational system\nHow is this would be fairly similar the lawns would be a very nicely kept in a green and mowed the town of the class with lots of churches that's down one [noise]\nHere's town to the schools would be based more on experience all kinds of things rather than than real memory\nPeople would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those and churches that was easy right\nConservatives like order liberals embraced ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to that so how did these two towns which I guess today refers to as liberal and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward explanation we use our upbringing and life experiences as a basis for a political beliefs we imagine that our parents teachers in friends shape our views on everything from taxes\nAnd the economy to immigration and national security but what if I told you there's something deeper into those attitudes drives that shaped the music we listen to the food we eat the politicians we elect\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences\nFrom biology [noise]\nA regular basis right before an election someone was Sharon articles with me about how science proves that the brains of liberals are stunted or a post on Twitter was say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\n[noise] these claims obscure something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological difference is between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nUniversity of Nebraska Lincoln he has spent many years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives he is co author of the book predisposed liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences\nYeah it's just what we're used to it makes sense to us so I I Do think that's something we need to continue the pound\nEmail to that a stimulus and what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of him and just because they're they have some emotional content but we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive for the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who was conservative [noise]\nThat's true I never been a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different\nAnd the one that we did it goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we have the most luck with a pictures of mutilation uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people\nYou know without knowing anything about them all in all week would look at was the brain scan results [noise] and we could be\nA incredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the base about\nLiberals brains when they looked at\nA mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the ... to some at a sensory too\nAnd this is part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I take it when the ... century would be active\nBut it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody's stepping on a rusty now goes right through their foot you're some at a sensory too it'd be active and what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals are more likely to have activation medicines for two and conservative\nDoesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted or just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find are consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents but my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics the shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you [noise]\n\nA really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nTono an identical twins each twin parish raised in the same household each ... each the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies now if you find differences between identical twins as a group and fraternal twins as a group\nThat suggest that biology not environment is a driver\nI asked John what such studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data set a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda Neves how long ago it's fairly dated data set a but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views and when we subject these data to the standard\nTwin design approach we did indeed uh find that their political views were quite heritable [noise] um although people oftentimes misread this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views or come from a genetics but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science so many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic\nThat obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not in zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that [noise]\nAnd so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a closer laying in the political orientation of identical twins than in the political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say\nOne of the big implications of all this work besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have which fresh inside\nA and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we're able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or buy a lot\nIn just the way we think about those differences talked about that I get ya [noise]\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handed us you know we used to think that uh if you were left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this is long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to to write with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left handed is very biological this is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people are realized that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do\nA then people are much more tolerant of that\nSo we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather\nWere oriented to the world in a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them that this is the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when we had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was often to the left of the more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a shortage of the political parties in recent years\nWhat explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years [noise]\nWhat I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had\nThis very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats and think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and try new things [noise]\nAsian and degradation of the Naga ration of Abraham Lincoln [noise]\nAnd it's not a newspaper and express what many were feeling in the country at the time southern states were starting to seat it was the eve of the civil war while the civil war brought the liberty to an end David still thinks of this moment as an example of destructive\nConflict that's because the conflict wasn't resolved so the Democratic process but through the bloodiest war in American history\nIn a sense the southerners those who are are going to favor secession\nThey're more committed to the institution of slavery\nThan to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interesting that you didn't oppose slavery per se wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand and that was a very controversial issue\nAnd many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand maintain political balance between free states and slave states they couldn't really\nStates would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in the fence fair and square they just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery they put that head\nOf the democracy so now the conflict justice fence into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength that they can also be in a credible source of weakness\nAnd the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers been yeah at that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\n\nI'm Wondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually willing to say I believe very strongly that I'm right\nBut I Want to have these concede the possibility\nThat maybe there are others who have something of value or it may be that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future\nI think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think that could be wrong there's a sense that if you believe in democracy so much there's only so far you're willing to go\nAnd so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family who writes a family we you know ... every family people fight the coral they disagree about all sorts of things but if there's loving the family the conflict only goes so far the love breaks down then actually the conflict convict the family [noise]\n\nIn the ... century the bonds that democracy what tested again when we come back the political upheavals
