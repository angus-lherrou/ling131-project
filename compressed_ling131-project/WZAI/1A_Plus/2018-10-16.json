A. M. U. dot org before we move on from Medicaid read\nI I Do want to get your sense of kind of where this is going only one state Maine has approved Medicaid expansion through the ballot box so voters in Maine voted for expanding Medicaid but the governor of Maine Paula page still refuses to do so\nHe talked about his opposition to expanding Medicaid during the morning talk show on W. veal AM radio back in July here's part of what means governors said\nOne thing I Know is nobody can force me to put state in red ink and I will not do that to tell them to go to jail before it put the food and read it and if that's the core tells me I have to do it then we're going to be going to jail\nAs part of Maine Governor Paula page speaking back in July and I read ... telling voters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political feed her I mean how's this going to ask well uh\nHe was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh ... was the loud and and bombastic candidates in a one two races that uh\nUh he probably shouldn't have one in the political side and that you know main is a pretty liberal state and\nI came in to shake up the old order and that's what voters elected in foreign\nUh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters on the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point all the pages turn out this year or the Democratic candidate is leading in most of the surveys that are that they're up there um but uh it it has not happened yet and as a consequence of all the pages actions\nThere are thousands of people in in Maine who not only voted for this thing but voted for this thing and now don't have the health care that they that they need and this was a ... it's a problem in Maine especially in a communities that have been hard hit by things like climate change the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the state along the northern coast\nOr is it has been pretty devastated and they work for very low wages and pretty dangerous jobs and\nUh you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs an issue I think that everybody sooner or later has to grapple with now dozens of states pass laws this year\nThe aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you we spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about isn't about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am representative Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the ... paid the retail price of the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that there might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would have been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned at the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers Kennedy and for the Democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban\nHad not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that Rhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with the air with the pharmacist in and learn what their their pricing options are because the vet is consistently one of the big complaints we hear from our\nConstituents on a on a regular basis as how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed laws like this\nWill be these gag clauses are are pretty common and uh last year there were a over a dozen states that [noise] excuse me took up legislation or\nHaving to do with these gag clauses um and actually just recently President Trump signed a bill outlawing these um gag clauses this was kind of low hanging fruit though of a\nOf a drug drug price issue a I don't think anyone like these gag clauses but uh\nUh that that will the let federal legislation and the state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggled to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nSince you mentioned the president's he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these gang clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nIt's the ... the lowest price active two thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices act and uh obviously based in the navy you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices at different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to a\nSchool the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have that a lot of people didn't want to have that but now we have it and it's going to really drive prices\nScott back up to the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law in this a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest of these laws and the country what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with this kind of progressive legislation is and that is in the lead on this on California is trying to reduce drug prices through transparency in other words they are requiring um uh the drug companies to be public about a\nPrice increase these increases beyond a certain point in the idea\nIs that uh if these are made public that they'll\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nAnd last year you had five more states um Connecticut Maine New Hampshire Oregon and Vermont all passed a drug pricing laws that are similar\nTo California so we'll see whether transparency is enough to reduce prices and then in addition to that um some states have tried to go even even further than that Massachusetts passed a bill that would've allowed a\nIts Medicaid program to exclude some drugs from the a formula or the the um [noise] uh the group of drugs that are available to Medicaid recipients and the idea was that this would give them some leverage when negotiating with a drug companies over prices\nIf they were able to exclude some FDA approved drugs and and as of right now Medicaid state Medicaid programs have to include all\nFDA approved drugs and their formula Larry the idea was that if they were able to exclude drugs that would give them leverage in negotiating on prices but uh the federal government shutdown that that effort by Massachusetts\nI Want to make our understand the argument from Massachusetts what they were trying to do and again you said the federal government shut that down so Massachusetts does not do this now right now for an hour an hour now but the ... it sounds like you're saying the argument is you know find Massachusetts and you know Julius the drug company I could say hey Julie this medication that we know is FDA approved is still too expensive\nAnd we're not going to just pay blanket leave for a medication we think it's too expensive so you have to keep negotiating or we're not going to we're not going to honor that part of the\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and

read Wilson Julie Rovner and Scott Greenberg are still time to get in a few more of your questions and thoughts about state health care policy where you live one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nJulie let's get to that question from months in law who tweeted isn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support\nIs that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer plan has a high deductible\nWell of course the people who have an employer plans with a high deductible or our big problem and the lower income people of those have a particular\nLarge problem if you have many thousands of dollars in deductibles have to pay before your insurance kicks and\nThere are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to uh basically fill in with employer insurance but generally Medicaid has sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off\nThe way the Affordable CARE Act was created with those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get 'em medicated people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts they don't have\nThose big to Dr balls so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own I'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin and we're constantly shifting back and forth\nBetween medicate and private plant and basically what they would do is the state was allowed to basically buy them into the private plans that they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere to eat sidebar for just a second let me to the point of this series to this is talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare\nThings that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter that every human being in the United states of America should have equally good plan was simple set of health care costs and there are other Americans who believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and their needs to be versatility\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going Julie\nActually it's where it's going is back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all these sort of small incremental changes that the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act was intended\nTo create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states still do an enormous amount of regulation of how can they always have the federal government has always been sort of the\nThe junior partner to the states um but it had gotten so such a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you lived in what kind of healthcare you were able to get to the Affordable CARE Act was trying to say\nThere's a floor beneath which people won't fall that is slowly being chipped away and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the Affordable CARE Act passed\nScott do you get the sense that this means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding that it is taking us back to where we were before as well\nAs Julie said it is in some states but in states that want to go in a different direction again California Massachusetts states like that\nThey are re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example ah on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they are joined the federal level um insurance is regulated or at the state level and if you're going to sell insurance in our state you are going to abide by these rules\nI'll tell you one issue read that states and many people have been hoping the federal government will act on and it's the it's kind of moved on anyway and that's dealing with medical marijuana it's on the ballot in some states again this year about twenty two states have already legalized pot for medical use some of legalize it for recreational use\nVoters in Utah will choose whether to join the states or not and the political battleground seems to have shifted and I want to read a few seats\nLiberal states into more conservative areas overtime or yeah and it's not just the medical that has gone that way but also legalization of recreational marijuana the two states where a legalization is going to be on the ballot this year is in Michigan in North Dakota\nA minute you know for legal legal recreational noted for in in on the medical side there are three different amendments in Missouri which is nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which are and then that Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved at this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana ah we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with this debate or it came up and you know in Florida last year and\nLast last year two years ago um but this is this is now a debate that I think it shows the shift in the political conversation around marijuana those sorts of people who approve of\nA marijuana legalization tend to be a older white males funny enough and then the millennial generation that the younger the basically the younger you are the more you in favor of\nA legalization you happen to be um the older white males the theory is that's the that's the sort of libertarian streak or they don't want the government regulating something that\nThey don't think the government has a hand in regulating and the real swing voters or perhaps not surprisingly come down to suburban women are in talking to the people who run campaigns for and against marijuana legalization or basically the battleground is ... mothers who were worried that their kids are going to be exposed to marijuana\nSo you get the proponents are talking about the law enforcement to ability and and the fact that not that this will not expand the market into younger people who will then have access to recreational marijuana and then you've got the opponents who say exactly the opposite that legalization will in fact\nUh begin to rope in a bunch of kids why are there are three items in Missouri\nSo they're all on the ballot from different ah proponents different sides of it with two of them are from a actual citizen groups that that put them on about those are amendment to an amendment three and then there's a proposition which I if I'm wrong I think the proposition goes on about it from the state legislatures that's going to be some kind of\nCompromise a piece that's proposition see 'em and they are all sort of competing with each other and this underscores another piece of\nThe evolution of of marijuana politics\nPots big business or in a lot of these states that have legalized Colorado Washington Oregon a California Nevada Alaska or Massachusetts and Maine uh the people who are setting up a ... who get to\nDetermine who's in the market um and who owns a very lucrative space one of the biggest opponents of recreational legalization in a bunch of early states where the people who ran medical marijuana shops because they already have the monopoly right why dilute the monopoly with other people\nI should know by the way we did a program this year about state laws on marijuana and the business of pie you can find that on line at the one a dot org\nScott a couple of things to add to what to read said on this very interesting issue um ah one is that it's sort of intersects with what we talked about earlier the opioid crisis because there are many people\nAre supporters of medical marijuana who argue that this is a viable alternative to uh to opioids for people who have chronic pain\nAnd then also I think we've written about this um it's interesting that social justice provisions are finding their way into marijuana bills or this idea that a\nNational Weather service for casting a sunny breezy day today we have a brief time

U. the station that produces one a\nThe White House and a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute poll welcome thanks structural Sarah I Wonder if we should just framed a discussion very clearly first of all this is a conversation that's for skeptics and believers alike right this is bigger than just is climate change real do this kind of feels to me like the human aspect\nAnd from our business sponsors whose commitment to double UCA I work on the Cape the coast and the island is shown to their financial contributions please take the time to let our sponsors know that you've noticed and that you appreciate their ongoing support mhm\nThe wind button on live radio which is why we make it simple to access our original WBAI story are in school or riding your inbox once a week for the summary of what's new in good at your favorite local NPR station\nYou can to explore catch up or dig deep I'm a local topics that matter to you standing up to the Cape and islands dot org and put on the ... sign up on [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Subaru featuring the all new three row is sent with eating for up to eight and a choice of second row captain's chairs love it's what makes us Subaru was Subaru learn more it Subaru dot com\nFrom fidelity investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learn more at ... dot com slash wealth fidelity brokerage services El Al ... and from Americans for the arts\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson we're discussing climate change and what we discuss when we discuss climate change\nWith Sarah my re founder of the ruined Institute and Paul blood so a promissory a lecture at American University Center for environmental policy we love to hear from you to wherever you are on the spectrum of belief with regards to climate change what kind of conversations\nAre you having with people in your life about climate change have you been able to win anyone over have you had any arguments that just went sideways tell us what this conversation it's been like for you comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U.\nDot org we know that for quite a few if you're discussing climate change can be difficult\nSo have you been giving us your suggestions for what has worked for you or what might work\nMelissa writes for my Bible friends I remind them that we are called to be good stewards of the earth\nNothing the environmentalists are suggesting would cause harm for my fiscally conservative friends I talk about the economics green power is more profitable and this is the future economy more jobs better jobs saving the earth for their grandchildren is way down on the list\nWe also heard from some of you who are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\nWe were in ... actually and environmental science and I'm very interested in protecting the environment and teaching about\nOne of the ways in which I can better explain myself to others and I just regular people who might not have the education that I had\nThat climate change because from where I'm standing right in the ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with us Paul I wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add to your comment the terminology often gets us in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all\nThis ... it's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions with a policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to peak global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty year period than elect a president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinions on climate\nKatie emailed my family has vacation to Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he will consider that just maybe there is a greater sing at play here what is it going to take for this to change\nChange the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation nurture it Sarah how would you respond to\nKatie gosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in the last that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and you know\nThis is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me like six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it\nPeople can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think is through and through relationship and trust and empathy\nOn because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger\nUm [noise] I anxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions ... into our part in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSure if I could just doing it a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak to the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean\nIt's hard not to read the latest report from the UN's climate change which we discuss last week on this program\nAnd not feel like well we're all going to die anyway why bother run up your credit 'cause they're not going to be radical acts you know what I'm saying like it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go\nWay well I Want to I so yeah I get it and I I Want to remind reminded us that as we sit with the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that we're living a science fiction fantasy right now\nSee that there are many other cultures around us and specifically in the U. S. Native American and indigenous Native American people\nWho have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at down the line and ... the the consequences from climate change we can look at the stories of human tenacity and how people struggle and survives\nThrough massive massive shift we know these stories and we can inform our strengths and resilience our courage by looking at the stories of for example the water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now saying the earth is precious we\nOnly have one planet and we're all going to show up and I'm informed that ... you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place and and ... vigilant\nI Would just go go ahead go ahead ... but oh I Would just add that\nFatal ism is a reasonable reaction if you don't know the full range of solutions\nThat there's a lot of good news here\nTwo years ago we eliminated one of them six main greenhouse gases it will no longer exist on earth Twenty years from now with the good golly agreement to phase out HFCs\nTurns out there three or four other super pollutants like methane and black carbon if we can reduce these quickly about three times the current rate\nWe can limit near term warming and prevent run away climate change\nWe need education about the fact that we can take hold of the climate crisis and actually solve it exactly to combat that fade lives and which is a serious problem and I I really do feel empathy for people who are overwhelmed by an apologist to begin a little further what our HFCs\nHR sees are hide your floor carbon sir manmade gas that ironically are used in refrigeration huh in air conditioners and they're growing incredibly quickly because we phased out an earlier set\nDot org support

back to our conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program about being Native American\nMassachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along that she is indeed of tribal heritage the test was a ... back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders said direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard\nIt's just one of many issues that may have Native American\nVoters talking head of the midterms if you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant to you what tribe or are you part of and how does that factor into your life leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a\nNow if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life what did you discover\nAnd how did it change you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Sarah ... and Paul blitz so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on Noel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kind of like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shuts you down and drains you\nNeed to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around and gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be ...\nLarge policy action to reduce emissions in the United states in globally to make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there were a few Republicans who\nAcknowledge like ah the congressman from some South Florida um but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with those policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation in a useful successful way\nI think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around\nClimate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those for example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would happen to years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that\nWell I mean bad things are happening right now so [laughter] there's evidence that um that that those projections are coming through I mean all of that pieces of projections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentrations and we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there's so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the seas and Audi of different places are influenced by the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a\nCollapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why\nAnd people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is the ...\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nOscillation between glacial an inter glacial state abrupt warming to enter glacial followed by slow cooling into glacial state so that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sons of Sarah backup\nOranges along on the other changing geometric relationship between glacial an intellectual stayed last me it's so cool it's amazing like oh man it's confusing like like bring it down to earth from me\nOkay so in the last million years the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states\nWhere there's an ice on top of North American and you're Asian continent sea level is lower on it's a colder climate on and then in inter glacial state so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis on this piecing this um authorization it's ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and the heartbeat from cold too warm or cold too warm that heartbeat with paste\nBy the way goals and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth killed as it moves around the sun\nSo I only make sure following you this yeah heartbeat this earth heartbeat between poll too warm Cold War\nIt's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat as off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that what you're saying that's exactly right I like ... okay that makes a youthful\nPattern that's been ... that's been happening for the last million years we ... we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern\nI was out there on a super high cholesterol sugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof\nAnd um the climate system can't take that\nForever that will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect them as that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there is not a conspiracy of tens and hundreds of thousands of ...\nCreate a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases their understanding the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed up a degree and a half Fahrenheit we're on our way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that's just the factual information I I I think we were very few people actually denied about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the U. S. public actually\nDenied climate science what I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action\nPublished so former climate advisor for the Clinton White house promissory Electra at American University Center for environmental policy\nAnd a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute Paul thanks very much for talking to us thank you judge them and Sarah my PHD research associate at the University of Washington and founder of the ...

Joshua Johnson in Washington for years America's security and defense chiefs have warned that a major terror attack is inevitable and the next one may well come on line there have been big cyber attacks in recent years but which one do you think has made the biggest difference\nWas that the Iranian cyberattack against the damn in New York two years ago here's what Preet Bharara the former U.S attorney based in Manhattan said back in twenty sixteen\nWe now live in Atlanta and devastating attack on our financial system our infrastructure and our way of life can be launched from anywhere in the world\nMaybe it was when China hacked the federal government's H R department the office of Personnel Management that attack compromise to private information of Twenty one million government workers and their spouses and close relatives\nRepublican congressman Michael McCall of Texas chairs the house homeland security committee here's what he told CBS News in twenty Fifteen\nThis is the most significant breach of federal networks in us history in my judgment this was an attack by China against the United states government it qualifies to espionage and that raises all sorts of issues that we need to do\nAnd of course there's Russia it's clear now that Vladimir Putin's tried to disrupt and interfere with the twenty sixteen election surely that stands out as our biggest cyberattack before leaving office President Obama stressed the need for action\nAs a consequence [laughter] it is important for us to review all elements of that and make sure that we're preventing that kind of

Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress that his company needs to raise its game\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company\nFor most of our existence we focused on all the good the connector and people can do and is Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love for making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and at the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica begrudge she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions of new post every day\nOr so the first thing we become aware is if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the fight if you do it comes through in its reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might pilot our policies so for instance terror propaganda now we remove of the terror propaganda that we've removed from face but more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flags that for us\nNow once content has been flagged as potentially violating our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on those content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages\nA and making a decision if it violates the policy and ... if it doesn't violate the policy to leave it up\nThat's got to be a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area that person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise\nWe have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire hunting reviewers who speak all different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have native language speakers because they really understand the way that language is used\nYou're hired as a constant review or you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in one so for instance you'll learn all about um [noise] our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm threats of self harm\nWhen you catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook and violates its terms\nWhat's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it is the kind of thing to say a reviewer or bought would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook deals with it\nStill rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on the side\nThat said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag\nViolating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well and a couple of areas where it's harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda\nI'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can slide the vast majority of that content before anybody in the community send it to us or sees it at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery\nOr terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very contextual for instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out\nThen there's a backstory there and the words I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns how does that pattern recognition work\nWell we do so most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on actors themselves for instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we'll remove your account even if you're not otherwise violating our content policies we also have policies against\nTerror organizations and our members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance want it to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens and rain does we would still remove it\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nCreated for the purpose of blame somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us\nThe reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that's going to come through to our review teams first and so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that's what's going to come through our reviewers and they'll be able to take immediate action\nAlso worth noting if you're a mobile use or like if if you're an iPhone use or if you just have one comment directly sometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or light or copy and then there's other options and in those other options there's an option to report somebody I Wonder\nHow much Facebook is facing the learning curve of a world as learning to use Facebook know decides designed to be intuitive I think it is increasingly intuitive the more you use it and because you're global you've got people in some parts of the world who are just beginning for the first time\nTo have broadband devices or to be connected to a world where there are more devices in our people house Facebook teaching people to use Facebook\nWe definitely do outreach but you're right at different in different parts of the world people will have different levels as experience and finding these reporting options and even just understanding how this works", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Brewster", "day": "16"}
