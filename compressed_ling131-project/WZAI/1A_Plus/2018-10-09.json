A. M. U. dot org\nKatie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform I Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you\nIf you were just explain what we mean when we talk about redistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the descending you'll senses of\nCensus really starts the whole process or the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives\nThe states the official number of uh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get there's a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state all fifty states get one\nMember of the house of representatives at least you know they're four hundred and thirty five so that\nEliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington he'll method so California gets the fifty first date and if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well uh but then it does\nThe seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth ah and that's how we figure out\nThat ah say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on\nUh the population shift and the relative populations of each state so this happens every ten years and then\nEvery ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways uh some legislatures have challenged uh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power or other states other legislators have more willingly\nGiven up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various quirks here and there\nAre and uh the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty or that the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows\nPretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when\nThat are meant to favor their candidate a in a crazy ways in ways that are where the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own hiccups with\nPolitical gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we are going to see from around a lot of in this next redistricting\nYeah North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David of what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing these district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states of Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrat's who Washington a Democrats have only been successful and flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb state and the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these\nCompetitive swing states you also see this as well at the state legislative level\nSo you have all of these states that are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that Democrats may often when more votes state wide for it chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority\nIn in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override the actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it insulate members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead\nThat that kind of legislation um and it also discourages competition in a lot of the seats in North Carolina\nIn two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went without a major party competitor so voters had no choice and almost half of their districts here because folks\nTook a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nTo get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience as hot as POTUS topics including with Michael wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballots are fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election ain't that a load of crap\nThat's all the same in North Carolina Laura by the way we did a program a while back in February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online we have some gerrymandered districts and we wanted to see if you could tell the difference between the map of gerrymandered district\nAnd an ink blot on a Rorschach test\nYou can find that quiz if you search the words gerrymandering G. E. R. R. Y. M. A. N. D. E. R. I. N. G. it was a program that aired this February you'll find that on our website the one a doc Ford\nKatie let me come to you talk about voters not politicians I understand that this was a redistricting initiative that got started after you were trying to find some way\nTo be politically active but not overtly hyper partisan and this is something that galvanized people around you right\nYeah um I accidentally started a political movement with a Facebook post um it was after that too many sixteen election uh before\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from love me in makers have go to meetings\nAllowing people to connect around the globe to get work done learn more it go to meeting dot com\nFrom lumber liquidators suffering flooring installation nationwide with new styles of hardwood and would look waterproof flooring more lumber liquidators dot com or one eight hundred to two seven four zero three sex and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nQuick word about what we'll be discussing this time tomorrow will be a conversation about how we all have at work chances are that you have worked somewhere that made you feel like you had to be perfect show no fear never screw up and avoid asking for help not the easiest working conditions\nBut what else is there\nResearch or ... brown argues that the same kind of empathy we see in our personal lives should carry over to our workplaces if we want to do our best we would like to know if you have ever worked somewhere like that a company where you felt safe to be yourself\nYour whole self\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three fix one a one day how much are you able to be yourself at work does your company feel like a safe place to just be human or do you have to arm or up before you clock in everyday\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a where you can use our app won a vox pop to send us a high quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics we will share some of your stories when ... brown joins us in Studio tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Katie face he's the founder and executive director of voters not politicians David daily senior fellow at fair vote and the author of the upcoming book the rising and read Wilson national correspondent for the hill\nA couple of you wrote us to respond to lower his message about Pennsylvania's redrawn maps not being in place for this year's election\nMark writes that the new Pennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle Steve writes the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get us fair districts somewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures look at the old seventh congressional district\nThankfully the new districts are enforced for twenty Eighteen in some of them say that the seventh congressional district in Pennsylvania looks like goofy and Donald Duck facing one another's seriously\nHe's tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion world he sent us a link to a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com\nMrs they say gerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of voting districts than North Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district's Louisiana six Florida force Michigan fourteenth\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry a hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state and attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states\nWe got a lot of comments read about the role of Republicans\nIn gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current maps it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIs that fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what what do we know\nWell the Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and the ... Democrats that came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen\nThe way of Virginia elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines and Virginia\nAh but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which\nIs sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives uh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the there is no party is blameless in this\nUh gerrymandering started we get the word from a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts uh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal at members of the federalist party into one district and that\nAllowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those do exist to today are going to win all the districts around it uh the a newspaper ... in in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the\nBeginning of the republic um you could argue that some of this happened back in in ...\nBC uh but when we talk about\nToday yeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south that were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially\nIn the state of Maryland uh there's one district or out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes both parties do this Republicans have done it a more publicly\nLately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about a fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the winds aren't fair and therefore are probably\nThe ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the fact that that\nThese lines may not be fair right but the people who who ... tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nWe do get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the GOP is going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to redistricted by a nonpartisan commission\nSlow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts in the shape of a pencil\nJoanne wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court was a majority appointed by Republican governors and approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership than killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and say so publicly\nKatie Faye he I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had\nWith folks that you've been witness to folks kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel practically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience really has than that um I mean in Michigan that we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drying process so maybe that helps that we have volunteers who are Democrats or Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party\nWhen you contribute to W. few yo you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support WC I at Cape and islands dot org\nUm those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know we there's also\nA Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still Republicans who live in those districts and so their voices aren't heard or\nBecause a lot of these races are happening in the primaries and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level of Michigan we're a lot of people talking about even if they're the of fish\nAll that is there um representative as the party they leg they're much more extreme than what they would like to see and so I think that in Michigan in particular people have just had enough we feel like our government's doing a lot of overreach and want to help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the\nLeast transparent states when it comes to transparency in government um and that's the biggest thing we heard while you're doing those town hall says a lot of people saying you know I don't know why these lines are being drawn and then eight years later some emails coming\nComing out a talking directly about how these lines were drawn to guarantee one party an advantage or another and people are tired of it they want to be looked at as having our politicians accountable to us and not special interests um\nAnd you are listening to your local news and

had to cut you short before we possibly I Wonder if we could pick up with sets comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it seems rare that\nAfter shooting someone under questionable circumstances what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the key to all of this and that is the decision that the court made many years ago the grand case that basically said that when you are determining whether or not an officers engaged in the use of excessive force\nYou must basically take be in the state that that the steps of the state of the officer so it's a very subjective standard\nWhat would a reasonable officer have\nDone it in that situation so it is not an objective look is what is the officer feeling what is the officer seeing\nWhat is the officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do and as a result you find very few judgments first of all you know in in civil ensuing\nPolice departments are jurors have to again how hold the standard and prosecutors before they decide to to charge an officer\nHave to look at the standard and say what would an officer reasonable officer in that situation has done\nSo it is the Supreme Court that has set this rule for\nAll law enforcement agencies in the country\nAnd they were over Eighteen thousand separate police departments throughout the United states they all have different rules but they are all under the umbrella of whatever the Supreme Court said throughout all of that is the rule that is out there now\nYou were by the way referring to the cheeses Graham versus Connor Institute's from Nineteen eighty nine and some of you actually commented with regards to what's going on and officers mines like Peter Peter ... emailed it seemed like to do with the mentality of police officers that their life is paramount beyond all else including their safety\nI feel like whenever they are threatened with any sort of possible harm the used deadly force in the new somehow justified\nThis is a career in which they signed up for similar to the military were they know they're going to be put in harm's way to protect and serve the are paid for this\nMuch and one more voice to our conversation before we get to some more of your comments joining us now on the line is Shannon Spalding Chicago police officer who was also a whistle blower within the department more undercover with the FBI Shannon welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you Joshua no I understand you had been working as an FBI informants within the department and as a result of what happened the cause\nBond with you what what happened the cause such stirred did it has to do with with corruption inside the Chicago police department\n[noise] absolutely Joshua I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were\nActually involved and the money the narcotics trade with and the Chicago area and\nTherefore I began\nAnd operation dubbed operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who I use the term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer\nBut they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed these officers wanted them being Abbas to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department because\nBefore I came forward with operation brass tacks\nThe code of silence was unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist a they tried to label me as crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so maybe very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nI Wonder one vote is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer how law enforcement in my family but I've never taken an oath so I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider but I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying and stories and they got caught\nI Would be grateful to see them go because drugs all of us though why do you think it's not a similar mentality and law enforcement\n[noise] you know honestly a lot of police officers get approach man they still talk to me and you are correct\nOn us police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence is so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that\nOfficers actually fear what will happen to them if they break this code of silence and\nWhat was interesting to this\nA\nBreaking the code of silence is that there is this common misconception that ate the blue officers blue shirt common St officers going against other officers when actually I learned that the retaliation came from the top down\nBosses were actually in the rocking the officers who were working with me not to back me up\nOr they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of fear of becoming\nMe out of fear of retaliation and south or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them they complied because they it it it's easier and easier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't\nWant to they thought they had to I had officers come up to me and say you know I Believe in what you're doing but I Can't be seen talking to you because I'll be next\nWell let me let me play a clip from the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police Kevin ground this what do you have to say after the conviction of officer Jason Van Dyke this clip comes from WB easiest podcast on the climate Donald case called sixteen shots here is Kevin ...\nWhat I Do I Do believe putting some politicians I think that\nOver the last several years the reviews this case one thing and I want to remind everybody we answer millions of dollars every every every year and they've used this case to really took Romesh by the police department which has been unfortunate because I'm going to tell you this and um\nThe men and women over ... police department or some of the finest police

P.\nIn the app store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with new Franklin Shannon Spalding Patrick Smith and judge will doors Cordell let's get some more of your comments before we start kind of looking forward at where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHey sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard we do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and a gun\nHowever Galvin had these questions Galvin writes the question is what is reasonable does disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force is a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot\nWhile they may be criminals or the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions\nChurch Cordell maybe you should respond to golf and how do we suss out in a finer sense what reasonable mess is\nSeveral is is in the eye of the beholder it really has no one definition and what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes\nAre they saying and often times incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one definition of it\nBut but I Do want us to get to something you said Joshua about you know looking ahead I Believe it's time to we imagine policing in America\nPolicing in America today is is ... militaristic and police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color in low income communities\nThat's not how policing started in this country\nPolicing started with individuals who lived in the community who knew everyone and they were people who were not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community and it has dramatically changed we have police departments armed to the teeth\nWith tanks and all kinds of of the equipment that uh or commonly used in the military and I think it's time to to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need\nPolice officers to basically a patrol and and take care of traffic issues\nWhy can't that come from within the community why can't individuals' community members somehow ... ties to deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMuslim ... and I'm I'm not disagreeing with you just by way of doing some places we're lower level of sworn law enforcement officer does deal with things like parking enforcement in traffic enforcement things that are less likely to required to enforce\nSure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic force and and they\nThey do have a command structure and ... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have\nOf police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely I'm not opposed to criminal\nTo criminal justice reform but look what happened we we get body cameras and what what happens well we have officers simple oh don't turn the cameras on or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order to get footage out on the for example in liquid shooting so that that\nFor example has very little sunshine there's very little sunshine and police say wait don't get to know who these officers are their track record their history they're disciplined history it's very very difficult to get that information and state\nI think that dovetails with the comment that one of our listeners left for us Ritchie who lives in Maryland left list in our inbox\nI talked to police both black and white and uh they seem to have this militaristic approach to the community I have had experiences where you know we just simply\nYou know would rather have conflict with uh with I mean rather than actually serve it I really think that they should you know take away the first couple of months but at least two but she\nIs out of the community without gun makers Dana communities are forced to have a dialogue with community I think it'd be a lot better uh was certainly a community\nWhere did you thanks for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first\nIf we could contrast what Reggie said with another set of comments that we've gotten from some of our listeners like what's ... wrote scholar writes\nPolice put their lives on the line everyday protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality involve people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nNeal what would you say to folks who said that police work is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to get home at night\nSo I Believe it was Reggie that left a message yes um you know that was such a brilliant comment because forcing the dialogue see when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving\nAnd you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge Cornell said um\nHow it used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors when something happens they support you when you had those relationships but when you have this occupying force will you know none of the people are very ...\nConflict on the under ... on the other end of that relationship\nThat's a problem this goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform where the community\nDecides who the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever with the community decides what's important with the community decides you know what we can handle these issues that the ground level\nWe just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBut policing is very political it's political through the unions it's political through the mayors and governors and we'll never get to that place into the community this that and they come together and say we want control over our police departments and this is how we want to do it\nHaving that oversight at the beginning means that you don't need police review boards at the end when something goes horribly\nI did a series of papers this year big yellow paper lax\nMe you're listening to the Cape and islands

A. M. U. dot org speaking of the world of work there's been some breaking news this morning about a woman who is choosing a new job and has resigned from our current position\nNikki Haley America's ambassador to the United nations announced her resignation this morning\nHaley is formerly the governor of South Carolina has somewhat international reputation for being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on anything but it's on everything but says there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShe will also be remembered in part for striking back at White House adviser Larry Kudlow who suggested she might have been confused regarding Russian sanctions she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get refute that don't get confused\nShe and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nCan't say enough good things about Jared and um\nGenius that no one understands\nI mean to redo the NAFTA deal the way he did um what I've done working with him on the middle east peace plan it is so unbelievably well done and an office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the scenes\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're a better country because they are in this administration I also just have to say I'm certainly thank you my family Michael at the same\nAnd um my two little ones I adore them entertained us un you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time and energy into it um but they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make America a\nI'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good slate and um for the next to Vassar to come in but now I don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was\nI was governor for six years and we dealt with a hurricane a thousand year flood or church shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then to come in\nAnd just getting years of Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to be selfless enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so\nThank you Mr President have been an\nLifetime and I will say\nThis I'm for all of you that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can promise you what I'll be doing is campaigning for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president\nBut as Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations speaking just a few minutes ago at the White House announcing that she will be resigning from that post back now with our conversation with Renee brown and maybe by way of a transition\nWe should get through an email from Hillary who says I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed the work environment have you noticed a difference\nA ... a absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune from the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen\nIncreased polarization in our families in our neighborhoods among our friends is at work too and it feels dicey or at work um I think that\nPeople have to be careful um especially when there's power differential and it it's I I actually believe it's become a pretty significant source of anxiety at work and home\nJust being able to talk politics\nThey're dividing line yeah 'cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nPolicy I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to kind of open up\nIf that ... toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just needs to be this one person I Do to keep my head down and get to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we start talking about emphasizing and being vulnerable and being urban and compassionate and knew that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted or you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love that's going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of less\nI think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I'd never seen anything meaningful are significant come from mouth shut had down\nIn my career that's just not how we make contributions and so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and\nRumble and we use the term rumble because it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle is a foundational skill set\nI don't think spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high\nAnd we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experience as all of who you are to address the problems\nFor reading your book and based on the research that fuel to book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a scar yeah you know a scar is tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something tenders there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really it was actually voided my hypothesis going in so where did you arrive puffy I yeah I just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually\nCase so we asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders that there is a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred and fifty sea level global leaders\nThree years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are and these were NBA and NBA students at Wharton Kellogg Rice University and then\nTons of data evaluation data so I thought when when when it was\nClear that the future of leadership is about courage we need braver leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear but then we went and talked to several daring leaders and said so you're not afraid very often and they were like\nWhat I'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long I was like so that blew my hypothesis\nOf fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to daring leadership is\nArmor it's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger the having to be the newer and get everything right instead of being the learner\nUm so really you know and it's interesting what you said about scars intend to places\nNot only does armor keep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear and less it faster and grow\nAnd metastasize so we need to create work cultures were armor is not rewarded or needed [noise]\nWe are some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left in our inbox first let's hear

lead with regards to arm or Monday sold emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually a big part of this boxing is batteries are incredibly important um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and so armor is not about\nProfessional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense it it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I'm honored to protect feeling good about myself over\nThe difference between\nSo there's a difference between say armor and image\nSuch as kind of the self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's it's ... it's on a deeper level now\nIt's on a day but I mean the one of the greatest examples of armor armored leadership versus airing leadership has one form of armor we see a lot and folks is they need to be right that it's that I've got to be the network and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting that right\nWe got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which racial power structures and broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace\nDisproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor ... tweeted\nAs a woman of color an immigrant in an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming that distrust well here's what are the\nBiggest finance I think is that one of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the loss of vulnerability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic and said that I mean racism\nHomophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nThose are those are everyday traumas and it is real that that that that you know the armor that you need to survive those things Israel which is why if leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender is another you know I I think the kind of\nAnita Hill criticisms that happened after the forward testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of thundering away ... you got\nYou yeah I did was you know but absolutely vulnerability can be used against us um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core values and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some kind\nOf mission statement or vision clarification or posters everywhere\nIt's really worth nothing more than the paper on which was printed I worked at some companies or I'm going to some companies were the value statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well why don't we start\nYou suggest that we should limit our core values to to just to and there's a long list in the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list and I really struggled to American democracy to why only two\nWell here's a big if you don't operation allies values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat poster\nI mean it really [laughter] it's just really a poster so during the recording of my head that little tone [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] you know and so\nWhat was so you know operation allies values into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with have actually done that had taken the time to say you know what a some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in\nAnd so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data\nThe men and women\nWho had the capacity to be the most courageous could identify their values and they had two to three values and you know I have you know\nThere's a long list in the book like we talked about and there are like Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nAltruism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independent self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list are super important to me but when it comes down to it my two Corvette my core values for me are facing courage and I know that the core values because it's the place where every other thing on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we have a companion work buckets free downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational as an end to behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them and then we have our company values and\nQuarter loose on the values that you were to do it\nLike for example one of our values is take the care taking care of each other ourselves and the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean you either do it or you doubt and so\nI think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that has a real core finding which is courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught is learning how to rumble the phone or ability living into your values which we're talking about right now\nIt's braving trust understanding how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nDo you need to clear as you saw use I mean I I Would be fascinated to know what you listening right now fake my to core values are because I Know what they are I went through the list I finally figured out my too but I don't know that anyone would guess what my to war based on who I Am to work I Do like\nI guess one sure catcher I sure OK face no\nThere's not one of my two chords but it's an accomplished in one of my two calls but no I didn't tell us that you two are",
