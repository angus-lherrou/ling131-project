guest let me get to some of your stories in comments one member of the one eight text club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and afraid of the dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it the thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping\nBy the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today has to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault\nTo this program later on when you're more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids out of time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words of the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board more welcome to the program thanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times an account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote\nI never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nOn unremarkable what made you think of what you've been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years uh my friends and I have been and colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of our sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist who I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring doctor for its testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain and they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to just stay silent Ken my own experience\nCan you share with others to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I had I had a crush on I guess for a long time I think and we both had and an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was Twenty years old at the time on and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly then I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden\nWhich I had not consented to 'em and it was very painful and I\nI'm often to stop and and he eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think ... primary was probably too drunk to kind of know what was going on is what what I thought the time\nAnd you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nLast week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as the teenagers here is part of what professor Ford said\nIndelible in the hippocampus is the laughter a lot of free is laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun at my expense\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective what it is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus foods and what it does\n[noise] um they hit the campus is a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDr Ford and her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are involved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm I'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away\nYou when people who can encode that fit that fear about lying and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on the brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the music or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that even just hearing ...\n... you know it's really emotional um\nBut for get other details like a house you were in the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of help explain it but it is yeah brain operate\nIt kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way he described it it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie or you know you walking through on that house you'll forget all the decor but that's the thing that leaked out at you that kind of forced your adrenalin to rise that wouldn't coach that great example yes\nNow more you said that a moment we'll see mia Loren I beg your pardon Lawrence Taylor these moments than in code so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or did you just kind of have to deal with those things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through the ups or ten you\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm\nTalking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or some community support group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um what we do in our empowerment self defense classes\nAre is help people find their voice and find their physical power\nOr talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but um as professor Conan will tell you\nThe trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of ...\nUm release of that and so mad at basically means so much as body so um we we do role plays of practicing standing up for yourself or asking for what you want and we also do hitting\nI

yourself New York times journalist Marvin Gaye and Harvard University's terrorists and Conan we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into us\nMy name is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth which she wait thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why\nIt doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rape that less obvious mar it's easy to pretend it never happened and emotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and so hurt and so it shaped\nThanks very much for sharing your story with a smart gate and love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation embarrassed\nLike that after an attack like that wow and it's powerful um\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault a it was one of the things that many that that I dealt with but I have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nUm you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown due to social researcher reality shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame need secrecy to survive\nI'm an oath huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I you know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame\nAnd so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that\nI'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs 'em and no longer hold on to that I feel freer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around [noise]\nAnd that uh I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experiences as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching\nYou know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of the the embodiment of that injustice and\nThat's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from\nLawrence I just wanted to um that speak to what this what lives shared about her experience there are very honorable powerful reasons not to\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support WC AI at Cape and islands dot org\nReasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job um but they are all very real at at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape it them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nOn top of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell some people what happened I was called a whore\nLucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others and I was called a complainer\nAnd people wonder why survivors don't come forward\nPat emails when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist began molesting me he was thirty one he told my mom he had some work I could do for him if you check patients in nursing homes he took me to pornographic movie theaters you taught me what a glory hole was\nHe had a friend of his implant an IUD in me this went on for almost two years [noise]\nLauren let me stick with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway who spoke this weekend about her own experiences with being assaulted listen\nI feel very empathetic frankly for an actual assault sexual harassment\nAnd right now [noise]\nI ... I don't expect and judge Kavanaugh Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake or or ... to me how responsible for that responsible for their own kind that\nThat was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN learn what do you make it become\nWell first of all I'm Glad she came out as a survivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice ... it's a sign of Kellyanne Conway we none of us have ever seen before um but\nOn herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that\nThe\nAggressor is the only person responds a little further harassment abuse or assault you can for where anything you want you can get is drunk as you want if there is not a rape is there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's\nCarrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry\nCarlos wrote on our Facebook page I Am a fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault by a man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day it is difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of this I rarely hug any one and I'm ... extremely protective of my daughters\nProfessor cone and could you react to that I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how this might be playing out differently for male survivors of trauma versus women who have been traumatized\nThank you for bringing this up because um [noise]\nOne of the things we haven't talked much about is that men are also victims of sexual abuse and assault um and that the effects on them I'm of developing anxiety phobia pie TST are similar to that that women experience after being assaulted\nThis particular woodpecker has given up coming to the sewage which is about five feet away and has chosen to drum instead you're listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations\nYou're listening to double UCA I your local news and information source for the Cape the coast and the island Ninety point wonderful you ca I end up all you see a H.

H. M. U. dot ... let me start with the book this alliance\nGive us a sense of what that is in a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggests so\nYeah so so we already are familiar with the role that other scientists have played in warfare especially engineering\nYou know somebody had to invent the catapult when that was first showed up on the battlefield was at a symmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where your opponent has something that you don't have and you were in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call that an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the notebook have\nOf Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a master mind that sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of scientists engineer and an artist but moving forward you think of the physicist as a person who built the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know the ... you know wouldn't make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas at the biologist might weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysics says ... ... you may know such association\nBecause we just humbly sit at mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy\nAnd then we carefully take the detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw so that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics in the military it just never shows up but in fact\nAstrophysicist and then the earlier days are stronger as had been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations in particular the the need to navigate with precision\nAround the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nAnd to to know the night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky will just different depending on where you are on earth and things rise at different times and sat in different places\nAnd so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had\n... on this program for those who are more interested in this connection between science and the military\nAbout the origins of chemical weapons during World War one a good bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which produces one and you can find that conversation on line at the one a duck board\nNew President Trump announced the creation of a space for us this summer a six the branch of the military to focus on the militarization\nOf space I guess it will be a fifth branch since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book give us a sense of what happened within there is a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have\nAccomplish avoid to be in the best interest of the American people and humanity\nSo first of all just to to the space where there's not a new concept and ah it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the u._s. aerospace industry which at the time\nOr had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs there's consolidation in the industry it was competition from Europe with Airbus\nAnd other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets so there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry\nThe what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon it's on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're right or at least to the nearest airport [laughter]\n... doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but\nWe would call them drones I guess but so so you you ... when you\nLook at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well\nMight we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns or space 'cause these are the same companies\nAerospace companies that that became a word right and if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general and the air force than than now controls space activities of the military it's called the U.S air force base command\nFrom what's already happening so I wasn't going to second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had fast forward to today on the Trump announcement as well as the pants follow on announcement\nA bit if you just listened to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nThat was very we don't want to just be there we want to we don't want to just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will this mean\nDo you think that had thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy had Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than seeing the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have ... said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear\nThe future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really represent rhetoric not reality reality is a space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force\nAnd slide them out under one umbrella one sort of coherent umbrella\nAnd if you're going to do that uh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it uh that could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroids strikes and then the limit it could render us all extinct\nAs one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all\nSpecies of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that as a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nAnd the long term survive ability right of of of the ... that requires the sunlight to feed it so so a space force\nWould might include ... by the way I also throw in your clean up the debris it's up there while you're asked the space debris problem but so so here's the distinction I Want to make which ... which I don't I haven't seen the press or the public recognize\nUh restored of justice approached a healing after sexual assault that next time on the take away from WNYC NPR I today at

I think really matters they want to know that you you really care and you're ... you're in it and your\n... your your spirit energy that is spilling out of you that all your whole body mind and soul is ready to be given onto this grand adventure that we're all part taking in in the exploration of space so I think if you convey that uh I don't know if it's a slam dunk\nBut at least it's a um\nIt's a shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay on the basketball analogy\nJay tweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain\nA robot body are transplanting a human consciousness into a computer\n[noise] ah so first the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions as also we do some very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing to put a human brain into a robotic chassis\nUm when you could program the robotic chassis to have almost anything you really care about I don't see that as as as a thing that people will do and the other option was what to put put to put our our consciousness I live in LA\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is\nAn evidence of that is how many books are still written on it but it's evidence that usually you don't know\nWhat it is for example if you look on the shelf of of books on gravity is like three books we got gravity [laughter]\nWe're not still writing books on it ... it just the law yeah did obey gravity so um but it is sort of uploading all of your electro chemical impulses into some machine to mimic that\nTo mirror that maybe that comes along with consciousness we don't know but I see that happening long before we would take a brain and stick it in a in a machine by the way speaking of transplanting brain what I really want\nIs if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure a oh last\nAt least find a way to transplant the brain of an Alzheimer's patient into the body of I'm\nI'm not sorry the brain of an elitist patient into the body of an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body odor you lose your your mind\nThat this sounds very altered carbon even lost a lot of Netflix Savage [laughter] very Frankenstein to it really I I\nJust if if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find tears for both of those before we learn how to transplant a brain but I think about that all the time\nCertainly helps them certainly helps though is on wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is there's there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and your scoop out some water and they analyze what it really carefully and say\nThey're no whales in the ocean [laughter]\nBut you haven't looked the arts so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy and our search for life are intelligent life uh for example uh um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or Mars and perhaps\nThe problem is in no way doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\n[noise] Amy asked on our Facebook page will the human race cease to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends not considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\n[noise] we're pretty sure that nothing extinction level\nIs headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because the more dangerous and asteroid is the bigger it is typically and the bigger it as the easier it is to detect so so uh I I think we're good about that it's possible that a comic could come\nFrom out of nowhere because comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out or it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but in I regardless you want to help the space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding you know protecting having insurance plan\nThat you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating thing that it would be very rare so but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power\nAnd over nature and heed the warnings are scientists\nI Wonder how what what the over under is on that I tend to be\nFairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp of the value of the earth that this is the one home we have than many of their parents and and forebears and I kind of you know today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful I'm realistically hopeful so but I'm I'm I'm ... I'm\nI'm cynically hopeful so here's how this works cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they act\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right woman ever get to that point\nThis so this ... you know because we reach it or or or soil like green no because you reach a point where people say no this is to this is this I cannot tolerate any further on eight people\nI don't want to eight people are so rare that a grid is too hot [laughter] [noise] right right so you so you so we have restoring forces in the ...\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support to UCI at Cape and islands data word\nBottom and I've ... I've seen people bounce back\nSocieties bounce back ... people in power bounce back so how long you're going to deny science until it really interferes with your health and your wealth and he said oh my gosh I think I like science again and then you put the funds back him so I that's why I think we'll be okay\nJared submitted questions through our app won a vox pop\nYou think that human beings are physically incapable of understanding the fundamental nature of the universe if not what the timeline to solving say something like dark matter\nThe question Jared ... so I think about that all the time I'd lose sleep on whether I was slightly rephrase the question I lose sleep over whether the human mind is smart enough\nTo act to truly understand the universe as it is\nAnd I worry that we may not be smart enough to even know what question to ask\nAnd this disturbs me because we know who defines humans as intelligent we do we do yeah who's to say that that is sufficient intelligence to figure out how the universe works", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "02"}
