I Wonder what your senses of what's going on in terms of places of worship\nBeing targets this isn't new of course we've had this attack in Pittsburgh there was a shooting at the church in Sutherland Springs Texas earlier this year there was of course the church shooting in Charleston South Carolina a few years of a few years ago\nWhat is it about places of worship and make them such targets\nWell I think one thing Joshua is that places of worship segregate people according to their religion and to some extent according to their ethnicity or race so\nIf you want to target Jews where would you go you go to a synagogue because we're going to be all Jews there do you want to target Muslims you can go to a mosque if you want to target black people you can go to it a predominantly black church

dot AI\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson what role does faith play and bringing people together so worthwhile question especially after last weekend's mass shooting in Pittsburgh\nAnd it's a question on the mind of the Reverend Adam Hamilton he's founding pastor of the nation's largest Methodist Church back in Nineteen Ninety he founded the church of the resurrection in Lee would Kansas that suburb of Kansas City the goal was to attract what he calls thinking Christians with little or no engagement in their face\nToday it has more than twenty thousand members across four campuses it's considered one of the most influential mega churches in the nation\nPastor Hamilton says that he has observed deep divisions within his congregation that reflect the nation's divides what's his plan to get people of faith thinking differently\nWe discussed it this summer when we were both in Aspen, Colorado for this year's Aspen Ideas festival here's the first part of our conversation Joshua what's great to be with you today thank you describe your congregation to United Methodist church of the resurrection in Hollywood Kansas\nOr tell us about your country can sure we'll leave it as a suburb of Kansas City we've got four campuses throughout Kansas city's downtown Kansas City Missouri was rinse Missouri in a couple of Kansas on\nAnd it's a very diverse congregation it's a highly educated largely a highly educated we have um we did a poll not long ago we found out that forty nine point two five percent of our people are Republicans and fifty point seven five percent of our people are divided between independents and Democrats\nThe Republicans were divided between conservatives and ... you know conservatives on social issues and those were moderate progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally\nBut Democrats are largely moderate to a progressive and the independents are divided between Republican leaning independents and democratic leaning independents so we're we're pretty divided congregation and I think we represent the country you know fairly well they're kind of divided within divisions of the ... exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader\nSpeak about the issues that are happening in the world you know I constantly\nTo folk saying well you know you're being too political I Wish you wouldn't talk about politics and\nAnd I have to say okay wait a minute I'm not standing endorsing candidates I'm not even talking about the candidates\nBut what you're calling politics I'm calling ethics and morals and values when we're talking about\nJustice issues we're talking about people who are being hurt\nWe're talking about moral issues we're talking about ... and so if you think about what forms or politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on you know in radio spots or TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper sense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely and I pray that\nWhen you're doing your politics you're doing that through the lens of a deeper moral system in a value system\nHow much do you as a as a pastor is a minister lean into the political debates and a religious lens on them as opposed to trying to have times where you may be lean away from them like I imagine\nThere are some weeks where you think let's just do a sermon on you know typing earlier I just do a sermon on actually the story of the garden to be anything but pilots\nYeah so here's a so for the folks who are upset by it they feel like I'm doing it all the time\nBut here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week and in particular in this than the Trump era\nThere's always some you know big thing that's happened in the last week I Would be rewriting my sermon every ... every Saturday\nBased on what happened in the news that week and then probably Sunday Morning and and again probably Seventy morning and so what I said it's a that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance and yet somewhere in the midst of those is preaching on these themes the things that are happening in the news are going to come into play\nBut my ... isn't that a I mean I I think\nPeople are hearing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to church I'm not sure they always need one more year round of what they're already getting every day\nSo what I'm trying to do is is carefully choosing where one of the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be said when there's a school shooting\nAnd even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so like I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the soup into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or one of the issues we're facing and our society and then we're going to take a look and see how\nYou know for it to be a sermon and not just a an\nWe're going to look to see how to scripture speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things and when I Try to do the pressure I tried to take us to say okay I Know we are divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we're going to try to understand what might be the truth and this complex moral issue that this one site has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation then I'm going to say now you know with all the humility I can muster\nYou can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but this is how I see this issue right now [noise] gun guns is a is a great example of this and uh recently I preach the sermon on gun violence in schools I did a sermon on a on gun control and and gun legislation a year ago [noise]\nAnd as I did that you know I surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measures that one can take to um to address the prevalence of guns and how easy access to them and [noise]\nAnd it was interesting how how many people agreed on both the left in the right on some of these basic things now that sounds like potentially risky ground because it begins to get out of spirituality of actual policy yeah uh it does actually so so here we're talking about what would what would we as people of faith how how might we respond\nTo you know the issues of shootings in school so the shootings in the schools is the presenting or just violence in our communities is presenting issue\nAnd so and obviously there's no guns in the Bible but there are swords and spears so he got plenty of plenty of places where we talk about how do we respond to people who are our enemies we've got Jesus saying love your enemies we've got Paul talking about you know doing good to those that would harm you you know you've got a lot of things you could [noise]\nSo so there's a part of that that is going to be about those basic biblical principles but then there's going to be another part that's going to say so are there any solutions and is there any way that we as people of faith\nOn the left in the right can come together to find some solutions and in the end we found that more than two thirds of our people\nWho were gun owners agreed with us or you know we looked at four or five basic things that people said yes that that makes sense and in the end you know part of what we did as I said you know\nFor those of you know it's easy sometimes in the ... in the world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA are all gun toting nuts\nBut I I have friends and people who I Love dearly who are in the in our and they love to hunt and they're not gun toting nuts and they grieve every time there's a shooting in the school on the other side you know you've got the these are people who want to take all your guns away these are people who want to figure out we've got we've got to do something we got to come together so when you can when you ...\nYou can help them hear each other it opens the door to finding answers\nWhat does your congregation want from its religious experience at our church do they want a place to deal with the social issues that they want to refuge from the politics of the day do they just want you to stick to the scripture but did he want you to be more prophetic on the issues of our times what is your congregation expressing to you know the answer is yes\n[laughter] all of a lot of it if I if I get emails\nAcross the spectrum I have people who are like you know I it just makes me so mad when you talked about what's you know what's going on the news I don't want to hear about politics when it comes to church and again politics becomes the catch all phrase for something you said that I don't agree with\nAnd uh but I've got other folks are like so immigration on the border when ah when the children are being separated from the news broke about that\nYou know I'm hearing this News I'm out of town I'm hearing this news throughout the week I'm studying and I'm like do I talk about that this Sunday or do I spend another week really trying to see how it's going to resolve because I have a feeling within a week it's going to be it will start to be resolved and sure enough within a week there was an executive order and it's not all resolved but\nAnd I have people who are really mad like why didn't you you should have preached on this this weekend and I had other people were like thank you for not preaching on this weekend and the next week and I did I did that it was Father's Day weekend I did talk about it but um\nSo I it's all over the map on that and there but here we we also sort of the congregation recently to find out we're doing a worship survey to find out about music and different things what they what they want but we asked about the sermons which the sermons or do you find most compelling and then I'm On the response was when Adam deals with current issues where he's dealing with what's going on in the world\n[noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this

curriculum and hands on approach Morris co God John Merrick and dot edu\nHeard so much for many of you over your concerns regarding America's deep and deepening divide and again there's been a lot of criticism of the tone being set by President Trump but it's not a one way streets\nYou left in our inbox this is Steve from suburban Park Maryland my concern is the constant resorting to violence and quote quote in your face politics\nAnd actions by both sides the left and the right the dams and the Republicans hounding people out of restaurants is not a good way to start a good civil political discourse\nWas Tom from well I hear your focused on the political like when it seemed to have more of violence benefiting the political left as an example Hillary Clinton saying that it will not be suitable until butter empowered what's the opposite of being civil but me by\nMy name is Audrey I was in the synagogue when the shooter came in we need to stop teaching hate everyone who hates has been taught whom and how to irrationally blame accused threatening target\nWe lost some of the finest people in our community people always put loving and caring ahead of everything we do is teach our children it for thousands of years we've been the targets and we expect and it will continue it's our job to be stronger and to keep trying to teach everyone a better way of life\nBut we've lost these particular tones and the canvas of our congregations we've lost their chair and their laughter and their boundless optimism may there so it was the sound and the bonds of life eternal we are greatly reduced without them\nYou're always welcome to add your voice to the conversation feel free to leave us a voice mail at eight five five to three six one a one a let's say five five to three six one to one to\nHow we move forward as one is something we talked about was pastor Adam Hamilton he founded the church of the resurrection which is America's largest Methodist congregation\nNow a recent study found that Methodists or one of the nation's most politically divided denominations congregants and pastors are both split almost fifty fifty between Democrats and Republicans\nThat rising partisanship is particularly challenging for pastors like Hamilton and that's where we pick up a conversation\nHow do you help your congregation see themselves\nAs children of God first I think it's very easy today to just see people as jets and sharks this kind of political duality which to me is both boring and humanizing right and it just negates the three dimension Audi of of humanity I Wonder how\nGigantic congregation them help keep people seeing\nOne another in an equivalent way and and see through and around and past politics yeah so that is something\nThat we talked about regularly and I try to model for them\nThe modeling of treating people with dignity and respect and hearing their voices and not that they're all equal voices but just being able to treat people I mean the so in the during Tucson to have sixteen had our our country should memorized ... versus\nA do unto others as you have them do unto you I Hope you'll have this memorized already but if you don't we're going to memorize that and I want you to think about that every time you have a conversation about politics\nWhat does it mean to do unto others as you'd have them do unto you and then there was a a ... I think I actually had three I think the second one was love your neighbors you love yourself so what does it mean to love your neighbor who's a Democrat or Republican or somebody across the aisle or somebody who's ... loves Trump or somebody who hates Trump\nHow are you going to love them because you know in the end God God doesn't really care so much about what you thought about this or that President the gutters deeply about what do you love your fellow human beings and John says if you can't love your neighbor who you can see how can you say you love God you can't see\nAnd uh and so we talked about that in another one was a passage from Paul where he says let no evil talk come out of your mouth but only what is useful for building others up as there is need that your words might give grace to those who here\nAnd it's just a ... not only applies to your words out of your mouth but the ones you type in social media how are you allow your words to give grace to others as opposed to the humanizing them or you know so if you could\nBecome a passage ... author some people who we just need to let ... feels so good I mean really like we're having this debate about civility right now and I feel like it's\nJust it's too satisfying to take\nThe moral high ground men say what you know those people whoever those people are and I mean the here and I have the answer and you need to hear it and this is America and doggone it it's my turn to talk and I'm tired of bite my tongue aged fields\nTo satisfy the finally letter it I think that's exactly right I think\nThat's what we feel that we have to guard against I think it it naturally now there's not this isn't saying don't share what you think but sharing what you think in a way that's reflects the humility like I could be wrong about this I don't think so but I could be wrong about this and that treats the other as a human being is really important and\nMost of the time when we send those zingers out it feels really good and\nWhat if I'm quoting the Bible I Know one right 'cause it came out of the Bible\nYeah yeah well that goes back to our question about the second ago about the nuances the Bible\nPull out I can pull it averse and I can sing you with a thousand different versus that aren't really in keeping with the spirit of scripture but I certainly pulled out one verse out and made it made it saying here's the thing especially when it comes to complex arguments political or moral arguments is you cannot have a complex argument\nIn two hundred and eighty characters on Twitter mean thankfully they doubled the amount of space we have so we went from a hundred and forty to two hundred and eighty you can't do it you can't have those kind of arguments and you're you know a nifty responses on Facebook to somebody's post\nAnd you also when it comes to posting on Facebook to figure out how can I so here's the thing I I challenged people pastors across the country we talked about prophetic preaching and prophetic preaching has to do with saying the hard things you know in addressing justice in and righteousness all these things\nBut but when it comes to prophetic preaching I ask pastors you've got to decide do you want to irritate people are influenced them\nIt irritating people's easy it's just not hard to say something that's going to hurt their feelings or irritate them or make the mad\nBut if you actually want to change somebody's mind or you want to influence their thinking you've got to figure out how do I do that so if you if you're on Facebook and you want to influence your family and friends who might have different views you got to say how could I Do that in a way that my mom who feel totally opposite of me might actually go well I hadn't thought of it that way before\nAnd that's why you know when it comes to preaching unconsciously issues I typically my approach is to say here's why thoughtful people on this side see this see it as well here's wipe off of people in this I'd see it this way both quoting the Bible\nHere's where I come out I appreciate the folks on that side on this side I find myself more compelled by this but if you're on the other side no how much I Love you I mean I've had people come and go I came in and I knew you were preaching this I was going to hate your sermon 'cause I kind of had a feeling where you're going to let it came in ready to hate oh yeah yeah but then the way you approached my side\nOpen my ears and my heart to hear what you had to say\nThat's kind of hard for you though was a pastor I Know you're not trying to do harm now just personally in your own and I I Know I got to let you go shortly but in your own spiritual\nWalk I Wonder how you are\nDealing with this as someone who has a tremendous responsibility over a huge congregation who knows the obligation on a pastor and who's trying I'm sure trying not to hurt anybody and doesn't like being told I was ready to start arming Iraq or the\nBefore I let you go past are handled how are you dealing with this what's your spiritual walk like these days to be prophetic and helpful and resilient\nFeel like that's a a that's a part of the calling and how God is wired me so I I feel grateful to have a chance to do that and and I feel energized by having a congregation is divided and that I'm trying to help them hear each other and find a I I told him in our polarized country you know I feel like the church has a role to play in bringing healing to a polarized nation\nAnd we're we're a place it's are defining value is love\nSo if we can't figure out how to do this together in our congregation what hope is there for the world so I Want you to be in a small group or a Bible study or say school class of people who disagree with you and I want you to figure out how do you listen to each other and treat each other as brothers and sisters\nAnd how do you come out with a stronger view a better view veteran form because you've listened to both sides\nYou are

A. M. U. dot org me get to a few more of your comments Laura is in Goshen, Indiana\nLaura emailed Trump as the vanguard of our worst angels is effectively sounding the horn to release previously restrained prejudices latent in some Americans\nHate is now fair game at high volume what they call the end the political correctness is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now you don't know what you've got till it's gone and it's gone\nHeidi by Eric I Wonder if you could respond to that comment I Wonder if what Laura is saying in a way takes a little of the pressure off of President Trump in so far as he didn't create these views he happened to have tapped into them but you can't tap into something that wasn't already there\nI think that's a completely fair position I mean you know I mean the United states has had a long problem with white supremacy and racism and legally oppressed you know parts\nSo that that it's legitimate to say that this kind of hate has been there\nI Will say that the work we did at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great escalation and the number of hate groups for example\nOn line hate rhetoric particular lean during the years that Obama was in office as an African American he very much a set off white supremacist you were unhappy with him being elected to the highest office\nAnd the Internet it felt has allowed this kind of material to proliferate radicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't the case in prior areas so we have a lot more of it around and that's certainly something Trump has tapped into\nHow do you see it uh there's no question that there is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe a there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of the post World War two consensus um you know in general throughout through the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he isn't happening it and he's exploiting it to his political ah aims\nWe need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse in this is not a I'm not even talking about the rhetoric of hate per se um of polarization and up opposition at this point according to Gallup about twenty six percent of people\nIn America identify as Republican about twenty seven twenty eight percent identified as Democrats these are historic lows\nAs was noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other major institutions\nWe need to come up with a a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is\nI'm not a you know that is not based on demonization polarization and again either Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not simply a politician he is also on some level uh he should be leading the discussion in a way that is more productive than he is\nBut he's also not the only one are you doing this um [noise]\nAnd um the other thing to think about though is what is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and you know when we we live in a vial of a society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera\nBut in general crimes are going down and violence is going down so again\nRecognizing that rhetoric is one thing in reality is another I think is you know it was the starting point if any Congress\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nPolitical sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not saying that words have zero power but I think all you know who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence those words yeah weapons for sure and they let you all wore\nA you know yeah I I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realized that I you know or maybe it's a slippery position where I'm saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters but also that we need you know what what are we going to do about this I guess is it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous it as hate filled it is garbage I mean it is and you know it's been now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how do how do we have a better conversation about politics about places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then in that policies that actually work for the benefit of of\nI Do want to talk a little bit more going forward a little later in the conversation about what next steps might look like next so we'll we'll circle back to that Jennifer mochi a number of people\nHave commented on the role of the press of various media outlets that I Will try hard not to use the term ... media\nBecause there are so many different kinds of media out there will try to be a specific as we can and and thanks to those of you who've commented who have been specific who've mentioned specific networks or specific people that is extremely helpful so keep that up\nLet me get to a few of your comments about various media outlets in various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs to de twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news the president much like Andrew Jackson stands up to the press should he just let the Ninety percent negative coverage go we all need to be personally responsible\nMod asks why does he get so much airtime\nAnd Jim Wright's why hasn't anyone addressed the years of conditioning the public has received from talking heads such as Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck Alex Jones et cetera\nThey have permeated our society and finally elected their leader which only embolden stem\nJennifer before you react to that sweet of comments I should note that Glenn Beck in recent years has tried to walk back some of his rhetoric and has as publicly apologized and his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder\nOf an oval various media outlets playing this\nIt's a great question and I think that um there's a little bit of a historical big picture that um maybe would inform my answer here\nI'm In part of that is the reciprocal role that used to exist between the president and the press\nUm it used to be the case that uh there was a mutually beneficial relationship between the presidency and the press a largely because they needed each other the press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out\nAnd that relationship has fractured a and that's largely due to um cable news and social media and the fact that we all now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nUm and so information circulates in a very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago um which is really fractured this relationship between the press and the president and Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but Trump has really done much better for worse job depending on your perspective um and so a Trump is completely mastered the news cycle and the way that\nIs especially cable news has been complicit I think in\nIn amplifying his message\nOr you know on Twitter he has followers many of them are bought a\nBut most of Americans aren't on Twitter but we see his tweets everywhere right um because those messages are amplified and that is Trump using the bully pulpit the good pulpit of the presidency and also taking advantage of all of these other social media opportunities\nMonthly

your comments Fernando tweeted we are all adults at adults take responsibility for their own actions the media is trying to find a scapegoat and it is truly unfair but then again he is blamed for everything\nDone writes the shooter is responsible dumb question\nDrew tweeted Trump may not be responsible for the violence but the people who are feeling Bolden and encouraged by what he says as long as he remains inconsistent and denouncing violence and hatred they'll continue seeing him as an ally stood\nUp for what she can you respond to that last week from drew it is true that the president has denounced the violence I mean the first statement he made after the carnage in Charlottesville was to denounce white supremacy bigotry hatred notes forms\nThen in that press conference that impromptu press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday I think\nHe said there were good people on both sides ... I Wonder\nHow you view this in terms of\nThe the way that the president denounces violence at least in a statement and then makes comments that are vitriolic thereafter how do you see this\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address that question of responsibility and if we have a moment you know that after answer and so Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he is for city that um but that isn't his natural inclination\nThe way that Trump uses denial I'm In these situations when people do try to hold him accountable and suggest that he has some responsibility for something so for example during the campaign I'm a group of white nationalist at the Daily Stormer decided that they would avenge\nUm what they thought was a bad a article that was written by Julie coffee in GQ\nUm and so they sent her um hate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nAnd when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and you know the sun CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it and then he denies association with the people right or\nHe says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mind you know are these are these fans who've done this\nUm and then he does a third thing which is to wonder what um the journalist Julie ... had done to deserve this hatred you know did she write this terrible article that is full of you know lives about me\nUm and then to accuse ... other people doing the same kinds of things right to an appeal to hypocrisy um and if you look at when Trump is responding to these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nAnd he follows that same pattern he denies knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to quote ... which is an appeal to ... to say oh everybody else does this it's not just me\nUm and that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable [noise]\nThis is why I call him a demagogue a demagogue is an an accountable leader and that's a historic definition deriving from ancient Athens\nUm and and we're talking about whether Trump is responsible and we can say that he's responsible but I'm telling you Trump does not accept responsibility he won't take that responsibility um and admit that he in fact has been wrong\nI Wonder how effective the Jennifer ... in a situation like this to refer blaming you for this kind of wondering what your take on it to refer to President Trump\nAs a demagogue I mean she is do we elected president of the United states of America she won the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue you call all the people who looked at him supporters enablers of a demagogue\nBut I make it harder to have to kind of debate we need to have about ... about reforming the civil discourse\nSure it's an accurate term\nSo um if you look it up in the Oxford English dictionary and the lady you'll see that the first ... of a demagogue is positive for neutral it says that it's a leader of the people which is bad etymology of the word who defends the rights of the people against the other parts of the state\nThe second definition of demagogue is a leader who uses polarizing propaganda for their own personal gain Donald Trump is a demagogue in both senses of the word\nFor his fans for his followers and his voters the ones who won't leave him who will defend him at all costs they defend him because they see him as a heroic demagogue they see him as defending their rights against the other parts of the state that they believe are corrupt\nEveryone else who sees him as a demagogue into bad sense of the word sees him as using polarizing propaganda for his own game\nFor the use of the word to use the word accurate\nThough it may be is it helpful\nI think so [laughter] it's an analytic point we can't understand what Donald Trump is doing if we can't understand what he's doing an an accountable leader is a danger in any political community but his\nSpecially in a democracy political scientists and historians who are concerned about the health of the American democracy people who are charting democratic erosion and how democracies die\nThey point to the kind of language that he uses they point to the authoritarian tendencies of I'm wanting to uh\nYou know Jill people or change the constitution to all of these things all of these authoritarian tendencies um which are are grounded in his language frankly I'm as as evidence of democratic erosion\nHardy I Wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think a number of people on the political right have raised which is this idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around but the political discourse\nAs heated up in both directions many on the ride her pointed to the left saying that they use similar rhetoric to the rhetoric that President Trump has been using but they don't get cold out for quite as much here is a sample of some of what they refer to\nIt is time for us to be as hard as they are\nGoing to be hated his arm\nYou don't when they go low we\nGo low the\nThat you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to\nRecognize and respect is strength\nThat of course was former secretary of state and democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton preceded by democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters and first was former attorney general Eric Holder Heidi

some time now what made you decide to come back\nWhen his producer Hollywood producer Jason Blum a convinced me to come back\nI knew that one was a a a sequel was going to be made as I Know a Malik the cod he's the the son of the man who put up the money for the original Halloween so I knew there was a sequel coming\nBut Jason bomb or talk to me and he said you know where it's going to be made with or without us so why don't we meaning he he and I\nI'm getting bored and try to help it be good so nobody had put it to me that way before so I thought that's a great great thing\nJason ... been doing some pretty interesting things with horror movies lately what what do you make of where the genre stance today\nAs in good shape but it's always in good shape horror has been with cinnamon since the very beginning and I have a feeling\nA it will be with us until doomsday just because everybody's scared of something that were all born afraid we all understand fear and so it's really fun to go to a horror movie with your girlfriend or your significant other and cuddle and scream and so forth\nWhat was it like for you not being in the directors chair for the twenty eighth team version of Halloween you were involved in the film but what about watching someone else direct this movie it was a relief\nBecause I don't have to suffer the stress and anxiety\nThat directors suffer and that's a worst profession in the world other than being a coal miner the worst other than a cold I'll come on now well it could it could be worse I guess you could be a slaughterhouse type measures that\nYou're right ah it's not the worst now uh when when things were a it's great to be a director when they don't work it's it's really garbage\nWhat do you think movie fans least understand about what it takes to direct a movie especially a horror movie\nWell what are they at least understand let me think a a\nDirectors are responsible for all the central elements of a movie if it's supposed to be funny they're responsible for the humor of it if it's an adventure and so forth and so on so director of a horror movie think of it this way horror and\nComedy or a law like has it's tiny it's all about timing and it's all about when things happen and how they unfold and it's more complex than than people assume but a people\nFor an obvious violence and it's not\n[noise] yeah see I I I hear you on that it's an interesting analogy between horror and and comedy I'm not big on Gore I Do not personally do well around blood and Gore at all but a good suspenseful movie like I can I can hang with that 'cause that's that's a satisfying experience what what do you think\nIt takes to make that kind of timing in a horror movie\nWork what is it what does it take to make a horror movie work these are secrets that only the Brotherhood knows I Can't oh come on you can tell me something well look to make it really simple uh there are no rules for any horror film\nThe horror horror movies come out of the story\nAnd horror is every action think of it that way not a genre necessarily what's your reaction to things and that if the story is is unfolding then you use the story telling\nTo a a a set up your scares a set up things they're frightening for the audience he said the word earlier suspense that's what's you if you get the audience in suspense and you could scare them\nSo maybe

violent to the piano and guitar and other things I picked a lot of stuff up\nWere there any particular influences that you draw on when you made the music for the original Halloween or that you've drawn on over the years\nAll classical a\nMovie composers and classical ... ah musicians and rock and roll I'd get influenced everywhere\nWhat about the timing I did the theme to the original Halloween is not in a plain old for for your time it's in five four time it's an odd kind of time's signature was what drew you to that\nMy father taught me five four time uh when I was Thirteen he'd
