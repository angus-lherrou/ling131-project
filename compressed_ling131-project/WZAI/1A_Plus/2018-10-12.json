[laughter]\nI'm oh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show\nAnd [laughter] no I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into the the shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American ... well I\nI think you know obviously the the the giants as The Simpsons and I would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me\nOr my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of The Simpsons and um but also when I'm\nWanted it to exist outside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I I said ah we're going to and we start season one you're gonna watch it and the first is going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park but then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really take things seriously a in a way that people don't expect animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak and he said they are credible artist Carolyn that's sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat uh Internet a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some yeah I'm\n... is one of the first people we cast [laughter]\nAnd I was cast her whale as a newscaster well\nUh we we had in the script to um you know a guy or a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Linda ... that I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role [laughter] really and we called them it was like yeah sounds like fun um and he's fantastic we keep bringing back season after season\nAnd you know one of my ah first memories of making the show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had him do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some whale noises and you know this is Keith Olbermann who I thought it was a very serious man are goofing around going\nYou know making whale noises I thought this would be a fun show I think well\nOne of your other main characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison Aubrey who was phenomenal\nNow you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Alison breeze Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American this in the show now disease and that's changed Diane does take a trip to the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her\nUm how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nWe cast Alison ah in in the first season and we were about\nWhen we cast or we'd been working a with a different actress um who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issue so she couldn't be elite on our show any more\nUm and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing uh and she's going to a a great job ever since\nUm but more and more uh as I was looking around at at the cast and and thinking about\nYou know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that everyone in our casts was white and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this wasn't an intentional thing uh that I was doing as\nA racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were casting these characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is my I Need to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices\nOr tried to have more people of color on the show but when it comes to Dianne specifically\nUm you know I think there is a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles and I was not a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently is casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character and you know as I said and these other interviews\nUm I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness has prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it felt like this is the mistake we made\nAnd if I can just you know avoid it or you know glide passed it\nThen you know maybe this won't become an issue where this you know won't become the thing that I end up talking about in every interview and I I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up\nYou know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as a race didn't matter\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from

owner of NYC cue cards while the fairest and he's worked three decades behind the scenes on shows including Saturday Night live while the fairest in welcome to one a ah thanks for having me Joshua thanks for it's great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business\nA while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer I majored in writing\nAnd moved to New York in a you know my brother was working at the time as a receptionist\nAnd they knew that you kind of guy so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible and uh uh I got the job and I you know I did it just get my foot in the door and to make writing connections\nAnd uh you know I did I did make some writing sections that I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept on doing the cue cards and I got really good at doing ... very quickly\nAnd ah you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I own my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lotta shows\nSo clearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nYou know I I don't know I think one of the specially on Saturday Night live the live aspect of it and being out there you know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera\nA and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows and through this hard show that the you know they'd probably a lot of them have never done lived before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure the changes and all that stress that was involved with that and that was something that they show noticed and uh you know everyone was a pretty quickly and the ranks\nTell us a bit about your company what shows does your company do cue cards for\nUh the are four main shows that are that are that tape\nUm the Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are four main shows um and then we will do some reality shows we do a master we do all the Project Runway that shoots and then we do to show any show that comes to that down and he's ... guards you know work on that\nAs well what kinds of people do well at this line of work the first thing we look for is neat printing\nNow my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school track years ago people were like yeah we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of printing I as a cue cards I've seen her all written in all\nCaps yes correct It's you know it's it's a it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about the spacing between ... between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the space in between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody else history and say okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train that for like two or three weeks\nI'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn\nUm two or three weeks of training yeah it is 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you can't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just say that if he's been okay these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized than during whereas where how to end the card of courage to stand on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it flows the next time just so many different rules where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing it\nWe're speaking to Wally ... and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York okay so let's say you're working for me for you know\nThe late night with Joshua Johnson right and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me\nAll right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight\nLike near sighted or glasses okay so you were a glasses will your glasses on the show where you are contacts are we're not we're either I don't really like contacts hourglasses okay so you weren't your glasses so you can see fine I won't have to if you didn't wear glasses and you want to wear contacts I could put your letters bigger so that you could see but that would also make less words in the cards\nOh to then like if you're taught especially if you're telling jokes so I Would recommend glasses and contacts for you if you know if you want to so you got to wear your glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we would we would have rehearses ride would practice with you if you've never read two cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away because it'll it'll look like you're reading the cue cards\nHow do you mean look at the rally as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your band leader\nAnd I had cue cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play to those cue cards now if you were looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the car to the bed later the audience would be like oh he's ... obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those cue cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the camera so yeah so I'll I we open depending on where you are in position to the camera I'll make the cards the right the lettering\nThe right side so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nShow your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right especially with Saturday Night live that's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches\nAnd I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put the cards and I work with the director of the stage managers well well kind of can for and I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they needed extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical work week at SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously haven't filled eleven thirty five PM\nI Wish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday we start rehearsal is on Thursday and Thursdays a light day\nSo the music the musical group ... for the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only put one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more and it\nIt'll change from Thursday the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely written from Thursday to friday\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support WBAI at Cape and islands dot org\nThe without the luxury of

Out on the set blocking working with the actress having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock so sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you lower you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or do you have like veteran cue card writers working there is a little\nBit of both um mostly um\n[noise] people that are trying to get a footnote I encouraged that I I\nTry to tell them cue cards is not a career I I did make it a career for myself but there's not\nMuch room if you want to do it great for your lives that's awesome but you should be looking to do something else I'm encouraging them I'm helping them I'm introduced them to people that want they then in a career that they want to do mostly most of it's entertainment related but yeah you sit those long days or friday but that leads to Saturday where ever heard that they may come out from behind the scenes and never hurts it with me 'cause I Can't\nAnd from the comments you

sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to a tax a on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of it because when money at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAn economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business\nCalifornia's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality by twenty forty five which I'm sure sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to one of the policy prescriptions the I the IPC set forth\nA kind of crazy until you do it really ... very serious about doing it\nTalk about it probably think it'd be solved until you build consensus on and political well it's really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political well not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada at the same thing there yeah prime minister Justin Trudeau train a an ad\nAnd pose a carbon tax across the country and he's running into ... position at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment a few more comments on this not my economy tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change a good point not my economy I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not question the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying\nLeery tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you heart in your home and if you want to live in Florida\nThat his he Faisal risk of living within ... yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there you just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall\nHad to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the town cannot incorporate uh it's it's it's a tough one\nNobody's really tough and when we're we're when we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year are taught and they were just talking about the strength to break\n'em there are existential risks that are opposed not just to a community is close to the coastline to where we are talking about today but large cities like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurvive ability about resilience about whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take her that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change\nIs a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... one small point just the end if you think that that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about uh Americans also\nIt'll leaders generals like Colin Powell advisors had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nWill listen for those who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish your core speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going what your thoughts are and how things are going how well FEMA is meeting your needs\nState officials how well that's going we always love to hear from you feel free to email us one a at W.

Shane Harris and Todd's will still time to get into more of your questions and thoughts on the week's top stories\nWon a ass W. A. M. U. dot org ... let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nHis Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump is using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them\nSeem determined not to let the Kavanaugh confirmation\nGo it seems to have had opposite effect certainly so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put that provides though around what I'm about to say uh that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming mid terms we will know in four weeks however\nIt looks like now it's having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging the Republican and a red state actually had\nA chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee or maybe picking up an open seat to now a search for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously\nIn house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable uh I Can't say that has had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship\nOn house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nOr you know lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college uh I Would look to the house\nA number of the whole truth control the house after January the will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like Shane said before\nThey will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee or the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that church\n... I'll add to this you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance to grill FBI Director Christopher Wray on that face to face\nUm how much intervention did the White House do in this supplemental background check\nWill also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up so she's up for reelection you think that that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd last thing I'll say is she just last night um with trying to take the fight from you know on the SCOTUS thing too\nThat the way that Trump is trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real store and in from outside the White House just put forces three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on them she's very upset about that and Trump\nAt times to administration is really breaking from tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these ...\nI Do want to see if we can leave time it's all California politics before the roundup is up but a few more things out of D.C we wanted to discuss including the president's stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just missed swift\nFor endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee but he woke him Tania west of the White House yesterday Connie wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd we're going to look through the Gulf War and say I don't want it\nI Love this guy right let me give this\nI Love this guy right there\nNo county West was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear those Shane Harris Kanye seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he had noted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of easy to criticize but the fact that he\nSaid that he is a bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the resolute desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I I think it was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to dig through these ... people in this like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of said is this is just really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not\nThat surprising but I think for a lot of people there is a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president\nTo see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make of it a behavior from a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but there's also left many people scratching has had about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him a it was just a very strange moment and I know for\nFor for for me and my heart just tried to move fast as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving past as quickly as we could do that too but I should note the county's old nemesis Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media the Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British and has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram\nAnd voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand after\nStick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... he's Saudi dissident\nAnd a resident of the U.S he disappeared inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically think hit men to kill ... to show you because of his reporting\nThe Turkish government hasn't really provided any independent evidence for this they say they have security video and and and logs of people who signed in and so forth\nWhat do we actually know right now if anything about what really happens\nRight well what we know right now is largely coming from the Turks and Turkish security agencies are what we reported last night my colleagues and I and the Post's late last night was that the Turks have told the Americans that they actually have audio recordings and video from inside the consulate\nThat they say definitively prove ... who was an opinion writer for the post Washington Post a was a beaten tortured and killed and ultimately dismembered inside\nAnd I have a pitcher right over there for me I Want

A. M. U. dot org let's get back to that story of the Saudi Arabian journalist ... who has gone missing possibly murdered\n... we've heard a number of accounts particularly from the Turks about what Saudi Arabia allegedly did to Mr to show you that they basically say hitman after him what do we know for sure about the disappearance at this point\nFor shall we know that he walked into the ... ah in Istanbul and he didn't work out\nThat is what we know for sure there are reports that they were to go ... jets that came from Saudi Arabia or with fifty men of new they go see into a blackout a vines are drove to the ... so the ... generals residents which is allegedly ... show he may have been taken and they did what they did\nA Turkish intelligence have proof\nOr that or that they know what happened to him and that he was tortured and dismembered\nAnd I met the most brutal brutal death under the fifty men then flew back to a Saudi Arabia on the Gulf Stream jets a little later in the day now we know that the the planes that were those to play movements at different times that came into his stumble ... and then went back to Riyadh\nWho was on them ... that designation was within the state type of racist widowed one hundred percent no but you get the distinct sense that uh the ... the ... are telling the authorities here\nA ... you will thirties here in the U.S to understand is not a million miles from what I have just sketched out because I think that there has been a willingness to believe and that is why you're seeing\nThe deep expressions of anxiety and on these over what has unfolded and what the implications might be there's some things that you can easily sweep under the carpet in international affairs and there are some things that are just a bit more ... quit on this definitely falls into the category\nWhere we I Wonder if we can talk about the U.S in Saudi Arabia is relationship the real long time allies at a press conference at the oval office yesterday President Trump was asked about to she'll use disappearance here's part of what the president said\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and we're lucky again this took place in Turkey\nAnd to the best of our knowledge\nBecause she'll be is not a United States citizen is that right or is that a permanent resident okay we're all like John we'd all like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten million dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives\nThat would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people think\nPresident speaking at the oval office yesterday in ... he was referring to the human Saudi Arabia and the four or five alternatives would be other countries from home the Saudis could buy arms to hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms deal a military deal between the U.S\nAnd Saudi Arabia I Wonder if you could give us a sense of how this case fits into the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia especially in light of the comment that I read earlier a re read it chest sixteen forty three wrote on our website the one eight dot org and there is no reason\nThe heads more people than ISIS finally gives women the right to drive but it's only window dressing is killing civilians in Yemen and murdered a journalist who was critical of quote unquote royal family if I were king for a day all the weapons we've sold them would be rendered useless and Jared cush there would be banned from any policymaking\nLaw the sharp elbows thrown in that comment I Wonder if you could help\nUs ... ... yeah I think um it's it's really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold lead transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we have billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I Am so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually stand up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy\nAnd that attitude had activated a lot of\nUm people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle Chris Murphy and Rand Paul who've been arguing for a long time just as the commenter said I'm\nNow we're supporting a war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians and you know bus attacks and other things that are just horrendous um\nWhy the hell out of the country short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to reporters this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nI think that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval so no I think that ah and less and less of a sudden the journalists turns up alive I think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise]\nPlus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was a Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead\nSo I was gonna say people like Rand Paul are going to push back against armed ... about our support for the war in Yemen um even saw a at a law makers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that that the U. S. Trump him initiation have to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I Want it there is a counterpoint to this deal which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of said the quiet part out loud a little bit in the way he in the way he framed it out yesterday because we have never had a relationship an alliance based on value since World War two it had all been about money and oil think about nine eleven\n\nToday at noon on double you see any I support comes from you and from Cape Air your wings across the northeast flights to the Cape and islands including surface between Hyannis province town Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket and also seasonally to New York in so at one eight hundred Cape Air\nAnd from Cape Cod five serving Martha's Vineyard with full service spanking centers in vineyard haven and ... re investing deposits back into the island humidity to residential home and business loans and humidity contributions on the Web at Cape Cod five dot com\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from bona with the bonus certified crushed\nWould flooring contractor is committed to expertise and customer service contractor locate her and more information or at bona dot com\n[noise] from capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet capital one an a\nAnd from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nBack now to the front of news roundup with John ... uses and re Friedman still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the week's top stories as well one a at W.

U. dot for\nThe story of the president of Interpol Ming hung way was reported missing last week by his wife that stories moved Maine was detained by Chinese authorities on corruption charges\nHe resigned in immediate effect this week the arrest as part of a larger official anti corruption campaign by China's president Xi Jinping\nKnow grace among the ex Interpol president's wife is speaking out she told the Associated Press that she felt threatened a misuse of do we have a sense that you know of why this is going on and what it is that makes me so important to the Chinese government of what this means the larger sense well\nHe's been a long time operative of the the Chinese government and their arguments being made that this is part of an effort to purge non loyalists to the Shia government and so there is no definitive answer but\nI think the message that um many are taken as if somebody who's been in government this long and the police capacity\nUm could be sweat swept off the streets and his wife sent a knife ... the day the day he disappears that no one in China's safe and at the time of all this there was talk from party officials about the importance of absolute loyalties said their suggestions certainly is that somehow\nHe was less than loyal and the eyes of the government\nI Will say I think I'm One of the more interesting developments as well as his wife and how outspoken she has been she has been a sheet and French protective custody\nBut she's been speaking out in a way that we wouldn't normally see out of China and I thought it was an interesting development and may have led to more information coming out quicker than Chinese officials wanted to happen\nAnd so it was fascinating to watch her sort of use um the public platform in a way we'd see more often in the west as a way to get information about her husband and defend her husband it's it's something we don't normally see\nWhat's hard now to Brazil were far right presidents will convince Joe you're\nTo the top of the rings he nearly took the election was forty six percent of the vote just shy of preventing a runoff Brazilians will vote in the runoff election soon on October twenty eighth where we Freidman can you remind us who Joe ... is and what makes him and his policy platform so newsworthy\nYeah he's a fascinating character he's been he's a former army captain has been in a Congress for almost three decades\nUm he is a law and order candidate that is his big thing so he says you know our crime rates are too high we need to empower the police he is very controversial and saying you know the police need to shoot first\nUm and and um shoot to kill 'em and and also to losing gun laws to address crime rates he's also very controversial in the sense that he said things that are most optimistic\nUm that are anti algae ... T um and one other thing it's really important is to Brazil we often forget I'm only became a democracy in Nineteen eighty five or return to democracy in Nineteen eighty five for Twenty one years ahead of dictatorship and he has spoken ... um\nAbout the time of the dictatorship as a time when there was a law and order one other point to know is it he ... with Donald Trump a lot of conservatives feel that Donald Trump has the right formula be pro business you know loosen regulations\nAh you know be nationalistic and be about cracking down on crime and he has promised to be a really close ally of the United states all of this is\nI'm very a shocking because Brazil for many ... for decades has been led by a leftist government uh there was a little more ambivalent about its relationship with the United states and certainly a didn't espouse come to the right wing view is\nThat he uh spouses so this is a real shock to the system I think it really goes to the fact\nThat Brazil I mean in deep recession it's embroiled in a massive corruption\nUm crisis or that affected all parties except for both an arrow who is actually not been implicated in this and that was his\nThat was hit the winning point I'll say one other thing we you know the Atlantic read an article in which they interviewed a a cab driver who said you know things are so bad maybe we need someone with crazy ideas or who else is going to fix this math and so I think that that is that is the sentiment that it's worth keeping an eye on because that was a similar sentiment\nInbred that in Donald Trump's victory in the victory of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to Mexico I mean this is a sentiment that people are feeling against the establishment in many countries of the world\nBlood to hear from some Brazilians who are listening and today and looking ahead to the election one listener emailed I'm and I'm a Brazilian listening from me sitting next to Brazil's capital Brasilia I'm very concerned about the future of our democracy the candidate leading the polls is an ex military who has\nThere's also racist massage and his and homophobic since last Sunday the election day more than fifty people have suffered physical and verbal aggressions from both so NATO supporters social media specifically what's app\nIs playing a very important role and lots of fake news is circulating I really believe that with Wilson auto our democracy is at risk\nJohn ... what's projected to happen for the runoff is there any sense of whether ... could win this\nFor the last poll I saw suggested yes that the latest post suggests that he is at fifty eight percent\nOn the opposition leader is at forty two percent or ... for them to her dad and so I kinda think that you'd have to say that it's eight with that sort of ... that is going to take some quite something for the left is kind of candidate to come back from that position um I mean you know they took about violence and the other thing about both NATO it he was stabbed\nIn September as a rally I'm so there's been a lot of violence around but it has meant that he has it been able to say\nI really love to take part in debates but I really count at the moment because I'm Still you know slightly getting stopping that I had things that I'm afraid I might be able to come to your studio this evening and so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is he's got his head down he has said what he said people know exactly where he stands and I think he sees the finish line\nOne story that much of the world has been talking about has to do with a new report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I. P. C. C.\nThe report says that the world is quickly running out of time to stem catastrophic climate change scientists predict we're on course to go beyond a crucial threshold of the world's average temperature rising one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nIn just over about ten years they said that would leave us dealing with the risks of extreme drought wildfires floods food shortages for hundreds of millions of people we talked about this report on the program this week one comment from a listener stuck along the lines that at least here in America\nThis is just not a big enough issue I mean people vote for a lot of reasons and the state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about or that voters demand to discuss Nancy use if what is your sense of that of whether or not this report has made an impact around the world enough for people to start demanding\nAction I think it's made an impact that the problem is the effect said that's already being seen in various ways around the world so where one country can say it's not a big impact and that our country could see it as an immediate impact and something that needs to be done\nIt changes at this report says need to happen are so I'm drastic that it demands sort of a uniform world agreed upon action and we're not there yet and so I'm ... years scene of variance in response and I think it really reflects the variants of impact that nation's already seen\nAnd you know as a as a war correspondent one of the things I see it come up most often as as a cause of the start of\nWars and conflicts environmental changes changing where people live how they're able to eat so I'm ... ... it's an area that doesn't just hit the environment that really hits other parts of of national security and government writ large but there is because of the complexity in terms of its impact\nI think it's hard to get a uniform agreement particularly to in such a polarized time um so it's hard to be optimistic that that will see at least in the short term the kinds of drastic changes at this report says needs to happen to stop literally famine drought wildfires really severe consequences\nStructure I was in Europe at the beginning of the week and when the report came out and on the um main national news shows a half an hour long for the same as the nightly news programs here the the first six seven minutes would devote to to decide PCC report", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Brewster", "day": "12"}
