Noah I'm calling from Little Rock Arkansas I graduated from Little Rock Central High school for integration correct\nAnd I noticed racial inequities at Central\nDuring my tenure and kind of two thousand or ... sample AP classes or mostly attended by all at once a it was kind of segregated minority students African American Hispanic and others were always eating in the cafeteria whereas\nWe were always outside we're being a white student\nSo for a school that was the center point a for racial integration I looked out I don't know to me is that are keeping in tune with the uh the Nineteen fifty five Jim Crow era\nThanks very much for sharing your story with us we will come more of your stories of what you've noticed in your school with ...\nDealt with as a student or maybe what you're dealing with now as a student or a parent or a teacher trying to improve\nRacial equity on campus what seems to be working in terms of closing achievement gaps and just making everyone feel welcome on campus what's getting in the way or if your school isn't even trying to do anything with racial equity\nWhat do you see is the hold up and what do you think might break the log jam\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org before we bring in our next two guests Steve I didn't want to ask you one thing about the way the documentary was made I Wonder how you set about\nTelling the students' stories I mean there is a moment in one episode where either you or a cameraman tries to talk about one student about her cutting class I mean all the kids that you follow go through various struggles with\nIts class with grades with life what kinds of boundaries do you have to set when you're telling a story about high schoolers\nWell that's a great question um I've always tried in the films I've done over the years is to a\n... have the subject feel like they have real agency in the making of what we're doing\nA you know the idea we aim for is is that we're really making the film with them not on them\nAnd yes ultimately we have editorial control but we take very seriously that kind of relationship and on this series it was vitally important that they're also be other filmmakers involved we had a diverse team of filmmakers Kevin ... Rebecca parish being Lou\nCharles the story was followed by Kevin ... I mean I felt a little bit with Charles but that's really a cabin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry ... that that followed a Charles a story and they had to establish these kinds of relationships um that are important now the moment you're talking about is with tiara that's actually a story I happened to be falling\nAnd you know you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with her because she was struggling with a lot of things at that time I thought it was relevant to include that in the film\nA few more for your comments before we bringing our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we failed to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period and the sentence agility for fun tweeted I've watched every episode of America\nHow clueless the white teachers are especially that physics teacher\nThe school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the news for full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Steve associate for his thoughts on the series we did not get a response but the invitation remains open we also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school Nathan rouse\nWe were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary eat or is that right see that's right\nWas that the more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmend the Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called\nDespite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to say thanks for having me also with us here at W. B. easy as David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is a Chicago native professor still Volkow thanks so much I have professors have you watched the series any part of it some of it all of that yes\nFestival what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest\nThing that struck me the hardest is an episode to win one of the parents of student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the end the conversation that we do not have\nAbout schools that have the illusion of integration and I said the illusion of integration because it just means that students of color are in the same place with white students\nWhen Mr mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he still happening today that to me is the story of us ... professor Lewis what about you [noise]\nYou know one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in the series but I think one of the things that also struck me as the silences some of the some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate and who wasn't\nOne of the things you notice in that district is that the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families a key leaders and the district a lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like\nThat kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on in the district\nPay by the way for those of you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you're eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so do you believe that in mind in the conversation if you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them tweets do not ... main [laughter] as I ruin this film for you I don't want to hear it\nBut if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety at the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org we're talking about racial\nEquity professor still vote what does that mean what does racial equity look like is it and making sure that black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people feel\nBeing nice to one another like how would we know racial equity if we had it right\nI mean I think this is and thank you for that question I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to a ... point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution\nSo when you talk about distribution so now the question becomes who has had the least\nAnd now what are those things that they talk about that they meet the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they need it\nAnd I think is ... is the issue and concern give me an example of getting people what they need when they need a young person says we have a particular problem with this teacher who is constantly giving us disciplinary referrals\nConstantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious now there needs to be some that racial equity team at the schoolhouse wherever that is\nThat person needs to be in the conversation or that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people which often happens in school houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition\nProfessor Lewis ... what do you find that the big barriers to advancing toward racial equity is it is it funding is that the people involved is it different for every school in every district what tends to get in the way\n\n\n[noise]\n\nSupport for NPR\nFrom the

five to three six one a one a I'd say five five to three six one two one two will dig deeper into the files of ... and get to some of your questions tomorrow from Atlanta on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors amend the Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one a tax club how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother tax club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to wrap myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was whites unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like advanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way can push too far\nIt's one vantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make it\nTo me I I mean it's not a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough right when we talk about equity\nWe have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity and then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one white student did not get one scholarship does not mean that\nBlack and Latino students across the country do not are not they make Lee denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand\nThe individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve what's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to parse out three actions that that finally\nWell I've I've not on Twitter for\nPersonal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdote experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience if for no other reason than there are other reasons is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not living in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all\nOf the things that we see an awful lot of and documentary filmmaking including some past work and I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white\nParents Charles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for anyone's high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin does that reflect your experience and all my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general like those kind of lay her essay is there's this blanket we put over white kids as like your you know they always going to be one regardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one\nThere's like okay well we got like a whole bunch of sleeping bags but we ain't got one blink if everybody in only some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who's also feature documentary where like\nI wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to like compared to any of the students but the school has like\nI guess prominent interest in us because of what we do without extra curricula and so it was just already saying that they're like okay well we need to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who isn't in any extra curricular lose who doesn't have any type of\nUm non student teacher relationship with and you do in the building they like it's hard you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even considered it's a good one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there is it's blankets by sleeping bags whereas like\nOf all the white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have states in the school the parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever and then you got the kids who I mean like me luckily I found spoken word but you've got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to oh the but\nOther than that right it was not really so you kinda have to fend for yourself exactly and we like it does is not the case you know I think it it goes to showing 'em which episodes that Mr ... who was like most of the kids and his our news um tutoring sessions are usually white to an all white they said yeah All right and that's that's part like you know\nPersonal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to get on his tutoring but as the one right that you know so\nWell to that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past\nThirty years [noise]\nKnow it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you can take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like adding stand like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens of these kinds of districts\nThat tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts that we take it that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in and we track them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means\nBetter they can better teaching and so we take that might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time and so when we look at schools like a park as Dave said earlier\nThe structures that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks um are inevitably going to uh take\nRacial disparities that exist and all our society and and reproduce them in our schools and that this ... the troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how these trucks get created and if you look at the history of the really deep racist history of tracking and general\nRace also becomes explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational spaces in school or Ninety percent white and the least advantage educational experience you know there are places in the same exact school I put on the black\nShould have us all up in arms that the fact that we think that that's okay it's all about our racial mythology\nI I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and what a good education is and you know I've heard a beep teachers including ... Williams the black or a teacher in the series\nLament the fact that is a piece students often just want to be given the information they need to score well on the test that's what they want they're not really that interested in learning\nNinety point one WBAI and W. ca I H.

A. M. U. dot org\nBack to that comment with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various talks authorities that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up\nValuations I mean when Fred Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had and the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business is off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more than devaluation can you give us a sense Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of ... large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a valuation of you know five ten million but on the same hand when they had a charitable donation um\nWhere they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go high they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nAnd of course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS then that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but\nRuss I Wonder if you could respond to a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking whether this is kind of unique to the trumps\nBryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich\nAfter the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone rich is engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer right\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we're talking about here that we uncovered\nAre um trust arrangements that the IRS as in door St sometimes after being pushed\nBy a U.S trust in a state attorneys I'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them this grand jury attained annuity trust which is the formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump and his siblings took\nOwnership of their fathers empire in the nineties there's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so\nThere are aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of when pat invoices so Don Trump and his siblings could start\nA kicking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kinda things aren't a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we are talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey used a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people that Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in the state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I'd like to get one more comment that was sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs Jeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people have received benefits and her father I see this as that story the second part is taxes avoided\nThat is illegal method of reducing your tax bill through existing a statute taxes evaded now that would be interesting but so far all areas that he use certain ... to avoid paying taxes as we all do\nWe all take adoption standard or otherwise\nJeff thanks for sharing your thoughts with Suzanne what would you say to dress\nUp\nThe top I mean these are standard deduction so one at one of the um one of the things that we wrote about that Russ mentioned\nUm was a company that was set up it's it's interesting because it's true that the rich due to a lot of things to avoid taxes the trumps cross the line into illegality and one of the companies that we wrote about um this company called all county building supply\nMonthly contribution at any level makes a big difference to us so thanks [noise]\n\nSupport comes from you and from

W. A. M. U. dot org before we get to more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this\nIs their job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how did they reflect on this and\nTheir job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout the story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ... large um they're under ...\nStuff does get through 'em and I I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality of the uh the toxin out against\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did\nUm you understand when when the IRS does the something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement and we we saw that additional tax and certain things was paid when they saw valuations\nThat they too agreed real low um and then the cases settled in and and things move on\nAnd the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS I'm like oh county as the company where they had they were putting the voices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire an in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the Trump we're doing there so it's sort of a um a mix of they caught some stuff in and\nThey push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where\nWe're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late or are there statute of limitations that are involved there are statute of limitations\nOn any potential criminal charges those have since told there is if there's fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nSay based on ah the the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties Benjamin\nHas a clarifying question about all county building supplying maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne which said arrangement\nUm and it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been fifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would've had to pay some tax would have been a business tax um and it would have been substantially less than that\nThe president we know because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be ... potentially would've been able to shelter the income and not paid tax on it because in America when you have\nYou know loss as you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax if they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is is how\nFred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips at one of Donald Trump's fails casinos ... can you explain that to us\nSo that was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a payment on a bond basically a a money he owns owed to lenders\nUm and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos his father is a lawyer showed up with checks totaling three and a half million dollars\nBought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and and never cash them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan that Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make the payment and get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to full for civil law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they have really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nWell big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area without county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs onto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not so there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um\nThey're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalty\nThere's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities and other authorities could be looking at um what is this\nCould they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n... ... ...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who would choose to prosecute it but the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents or with a state agency um and there would be lower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners so if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're proved that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father\nAs he stated where exactly is the discrepancy none Suzanne ...\nInteresting comments I had one one thing that when when we started out Donald Trump has has stated that he started with a million dollar loan and he built into a billion dollar empire he is now in the White House and he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made\nFrom Woods Hole she came in with a dog put it on the chair took a picture of it she took it down to get it cut brought it

to our conversation with mark urban of BBC's news night his new book is called the scribbled files\nStill time to get some of your question to ask questions and comments in one a at W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one at a or comments on our Facebook page regarding the poisoning Martin asks there were five people substantially exposed to the nerve agent in Salzburg one of whom died what's the condition of the others\nMark [noise] um well ah\nSo those people on Nick Bailey who was a police officer who went to this ... house on the day of the poisoning he is a much better but still not ready to return to work\nA of cools a Charlie Rose Lee who was one of those who are then found the buffalo or in the summer in June and uh he's home ... because the person who died\nTo have had a very small very small dies so he was a very on well for a week or two but he also has made a recovery of salts and then of course you get to UT a script pile and ... and\nUh she was discharged from hospital a several weeks before he was once again\nI think one can ... from that but to a lesser dosage\nAnd so I suppose you could say the most seriously affected person who survived\nWell ... himself um uh when I interviewed the medical stuff their hospital you ... you had a clip earlier if you don't just even jokes\nThey was saying well ah we think that will be some side effects ... it's very hard for us to predict what may also I think one would still say that ... call themselves within the prices have come with essence that's my understanding or they're all some long term effects but of course\nYou know if people are not a keen to discuss the specifics that are both because it's an issue of ... medical confidentiality and ah because I think there was still a lot of unknowns\nWith regard to Yulia ... daughter ... emailed it's often assumed in the media that his daughter was an accidental\nCasualty however her fiance was a gi argue employee whose mother was also a high level G R U operative\nWhen she tried to reach her fiance from the hospital he and his mother disappear also interesting and it goes on to write also interesting that the two alleged hit men flew on the same flight as their daughter to London considering that scruples wife and son died earlier somewhat suddenly it seems that the poisoning when the daughter was visiting was not an accident\nThe big question in my mind is this an operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level order mark\nI'm well I I'll just pick colds and one little bits of Anna's a description that\nThe the two people are two suspects or did not flying on the same plane as you describe Powell they arrived the previous day as a different London apple got wake a she arrived then on the science data sowed amounts at Heathrow a on a plane for mostly but anyway um\nLet's just talk about uh that's just the detail um look there is definitely something over ... about a half arrival in the u._k. and the timing of the attack\nI'm ... and right from the outset people I was speaking to\nHappened investigated a believed that the timing was critical\nNow we know even more so that the suspects are named as ... had been in the u._k. on exactly the same period the last few days of February\n... and the first couple of days in March during the previous year twenty six team I I think it probably twenty Seventeen and then another man\nWho's been isolated or identified by Russian newspapers probably a pseudonym so gay few ...\nHad been in the u._k. at the same time as ... or in twenty Seventeen and at the same time late February early March twenty sixteen now this raises questions about\nOr would they ... for some time whether they using the fact that she lived in Russia and therefore they could hijack a email account and not spend the nights by the u._k. government that they were hacking it from twenty ... and indeed him eyeball fun [noise]\nUm she seems to have come back to be with her daddy Shia around that time because his brother slash a how to use the stay on the focus too much [noise]\nSo that's the ... uh by a late twenties Seventeen I'm fortunate they tragically a Sasha by the way had died but it's still supposed that she had come in twenty Eighteen to be with that at that time because it would be a difficult time because it was a time they were all normally together as a family\nSo that the that it's always been um a a a line of inquiry for the investigators that the timing of the attack was critically linked\nTo duty as a rival or hiking or data by females and stuff which said show up ... up from the apple is that your centers that Trump\nWould help them to locate so again make sure he was not a business trip when some other way absence and uh that this would be a good time to do it now and I also mentioned a boyfriend that um\nYou had bought a is a bit of a cab yet he is sold by some to have had connections with\nA one of the Russian intelligence agency thought he was not on the scene for example back in twenty sixteen when\nIt's believed that this um figure I'm using the name so if it does have traveled to the u._k. he was not on the scene back in twenty Thirteen when we know according to the u._k. government that her email account was hacked\nIt's more than a year so you know we don't know and no fan of he's not here to defend himself against any allegations that he had played some ...\nUm that we know that after the attack 'em at well nearly a month off of there was a court hearing to do with medical procedures that to happen and it was ... that he had not been in touch with the hospitals for example to find out how she was so the idea that he kind of a vanished from the scene seems to have some substance\nOr you'd have had access to the Internet since a fairly early on in a recovery we don't know whether she's reached out to him or whether indeed they often ... by\nA social media or messaging ... or email or whatever or buts we have to assume that they no longer income times\nTo get to a few more of your comments and questions from our urban another mark tweeted you got that out quick if it's half as good as your previous books it will be a pleasure and an education to read [noise]\nCO asked listening to this broadcast I was wondering if we knew why it was that he decided to
