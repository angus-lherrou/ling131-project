new book the red and blue the Nineteen nineties and the birth of political tribalism well here is one well remembered moment from the nineties I take you back\nTo president almost president at this point Bill Clinton\nYou answer that question is I've never broken state law and then when I was in England I experimented with rude to and I didn't like it didn't inhale and never tried it again\nBill Clinton in the run up to the presidential elections in Nineteen Ninety two are deceased lake Christopher Hitchens went to Oxford with Bill Clinton said the idea that Bill Clinton didn't inhale at Oxford\nWas probably true because he knew firsthand their Bill Clinton chose to take his marijuana in edible foreign ... Hitchens used to say he was no friend of Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that\nUh but Bill Clinton's answer was lampooned at the time it's still remember now\nTwenty six years later what political moments do you remember from the Nineteen nineties we want to hear from you what did they tell us about our politics today you can comment on our Facebook page you can tweet us ... when a you can email us one a at W. M. U. dot org we heard from Susan who sent us an email I Believe that our political risk started well\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs that you saw in the two thousand election and I say that we've lived with a sense\nThey're only going deeper and and the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after the twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment national able to the Mitt Romney's last a brac Obama included what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically\nThe way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term they came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins and I think it is not just that he won the general election or let the huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand ... granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of his party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator for one more term or is he is he converted what's he think I mean look there's there there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know to give you a couple of them that that that that jumped out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk if you are seen as separating yourself from this president your neck primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being\nA being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that\nThere's also the theory that hey part of this is Lindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence him but I think one of the other lessons\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support WBAI at Cape and islands dot org\nI think tells Lindsey Graham and just ... more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacturing and fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's\nChanged his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard\nAnd because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors expressed their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation\nOn the merits and in Steve you're nodding because that does not sound surprising\nTo you yeah well what he's describing his ticket splitting yet to be and political science they did the voters who go and they were Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and then that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal isn't All right let's get back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve ... so much of what your book is about\nUh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not\nTalk to you for this book although although he certainly could have a when he was a young rabble rousing congressmen who was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then time speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nMy partner's maker as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of this house\nIf you are saying to me the urine postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and

for you\nThe top Republican on the Senate Judiciary committee says the FBI has turned up nothing to corroborate allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was involved in sexual assault in high school and another instance of sexual misconduct in college there is nothing in it that we didn't already know said Senator Chuck Grassley adding\nThere's also no contemporaneous evidence this investigation found no hint of misconduct and the same is true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service that was Chuck Grassley chairman of the Judiciary Committee I was quoting their\nRanking member on the Senate Judiciary committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California disagrees she says it looks to be the product of an incomplete investigation\nThat was limited perhaps by the White House Dianne Feinstein ranking member expect much more on this throughout the day on your NPR station\nI Want to turn back to Steve ... in just a moment but before we do a quick appeal for some help with the program in the works for next week here on one day\nWe spend a lot of time yesterday talking with women about how society views angry women and there's a broad range of opinion but most of the women were hearing from our progressive and liberals\nIf you're a conservative woman tell us how your seeing this moment what have you got to say how do you want to be heard in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh and in the fight over me to the discussions over me to in this country do you think your views are being represented\nOr respected leave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one a one a if you're a female Republican or at least someone who would describe themselves as\nBroadly conservative what do you want the country to hear about you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a that's eight five five to three six one two one two will make sure to get your stories on the air part of the national conversation in the days ahead here on one a\nWhile we're talking for the most part about what politician said and ...\nOh do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington that's polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and\nAnd here's one and the president is right\nIn many ways we are a shining city on it but the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and glory there is this fair Mr President and the faces that you don't see in the places that you don't visit\nAnd you're a shining city\nAnd believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from oh gosh the early nineties I take you back towards any whole [noise]\nSoon to be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety to ... or send me also remember him are Sunni hall before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and in a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nWas also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second but in third place in the presidential race at that point Berkeley sort of Ross Perot laced with Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam drafted going through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li ... scheme is way out of\nOut of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to did change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase\nYou know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hot at that moment you showcase a different side of your personality and it was Ninety two it wasn't just are sending in Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot\nWho was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began in February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King live came in and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on and February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states\nI'll run for president as an independent\nIn ... just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures\nTo get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show I'm ... and George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show that night well\nWe won't be doing anything like that\nIn our city hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that went went after that was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't do in our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message um\nPoliticians now managed media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama had\nA winning personality an affable nice guy and he used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon just even cold there there isn't a show that Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than than maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public has\nChanged just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to\nAnd I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier in the rise of Gingrich net moment with Oh Neal what that moment came from was Gingrich looking for a way around what at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN\nGive CSPAN was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich or legal to build his career his rise in the house around that\nFast forward to Donald Trump or to dump Trump to\nTelevision obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter\nDonald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media is well this is so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties with CSPAN and Trump was doing with Twitter\nAnd and I think there's a real common thread there what let's go back then in the way way back machine one more time\nTo Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential run long before he was ever successful he went on meet the\nPress back in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about Pat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to your local news and information source for the ... the coast and the island swear Ninety point one double you see a on a double UCI HD one\nWoods Hole Martha's Vineyard Betty one point when W.

Patrick Leahy and and Dick Durbin and many of the Democrats who questioned him last Thursday fewer quick questions and then we'll we'll keep going let me get to some of your comments as well Virginia and in Washington DC writes democratic obstructionism\nMerrick Garland\nAnd Susan in Gainesville, Florida asks what on earth is the rationale for only one copy of the report a forty five pages being provided for review by one hundred senators\nSusan clearly a lot of things for voters to carry in they're not at all distant memories when they go to the polls in November go to the polls next month do you have any\nReal hard reliable sense is there any evidence of how much this may affect the mid term elections I mean a lot of what voters vote on in the midterms doesn't have to do with what happens in Washington celibate does a lot of it has to do with what happens at home we have a sense of what the balance is looking like right now\nWell look first of all it does depend in fact on how the ... and uh there is an interesting argument to be made that if Kavanaugh is\nConfirmed a it's much more likely in a way to somewhat fade as an issue for Republican voters while a becoming an enormous rallying cry for Democrats and conversely were he to go down a especially in such a spectacular fashion so close to the election\nClearly feels this which is why he's been Janine up his his voters over the last week on this he you know that work have not go down that this would outrage a and an enraged\nRepublican base voters in a way that could prove beneficial especially in some of these key Senate races are in it which is already taking place largely on a favorable to Republicans playing field this fault what's unusual about this\nDevice if we've had many divisive fights before a it strikes me that this is coming so close to a mid term election therefore injecting a volatile note of uncertainty with just weeks to go to the election number one number two a it is a cultural war being ignited arguably\nAmong Democrats and Republicans while\nBoth sides I I wrote last week about the two Americas that would listen to the very jarring lead different accounts offered by Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh and uh would process this hearing it in a completely different way I think we've all watched that playing out over the last week a each a\nPolitical tried in our increasingly tribally divided culture has a whole different facts at a whole different narrative a whole different argument to make its inflaming passions on both sides are Republicans have made a lot over polls in recent days showing that\nA Republican voter enthusiast and which had been very low very turned off in this midterm election year has sparked upwards a over the last week you could argue well that's just that the election getting closer and rise we're not sure how much it has to do with cabinet\nBut my guess is that you know for different parts of the country uh this works entirely differently a politically\nLet me get one more comments on this and then we will keep going of course we'll keep an eye on at the vote should be happening imminently short and we will urge and all that goes with one more comment on this from very wrote on our Facebook page\nThat's more of a radio hour from Iraq's reproduce it right here in Woods Hole and you can hear it um WC AI Tuesdays at two and Saturdays at\nNoon support comes from you and from serve pro upper Cape Cod and the island staff dedicated to providing twenty four seven residential and commercial services for damage caused by water fire and mold more at served pro upper Cape and islands dot com\nAnd from our business sponsors whose commitment to double UCA eyes work on the Cape the coast in the islands is shown through their financial contributions please take the time to let our sponsors know that you've noticed and that you appreciate their ongoing support\nSupport for NPR I'm from this station and from Boehner with the bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractor is committed to expertise and the customer service contract to locate her\nAnd from Brown University school of professional studies with executive master's degrees for mid career professionals in the fields of business cyber security healthcare and science and technology leadership brown dot edu slash NPR\nBack now to the friday news roundup with Susan Glasser Eugene Scott and Steve Clemons let's talk a little bit more about that New York times investigation regarding President Trump's finances uh ... Eugene ... I think\nOne of the things that is worth knowing for sure was what Susan Glasser said regarding the uh the provenance of the information related to the investigation are there other big questions that are still out there when it comes to the president's tax history we still don't have his tax returns provided by him for example I was\nGonna say that's the biggest question I mean the reality is this what's done over a I Believe Eighteen months what has happened since uh you know that piece was published or perhaps the research and that we still do not know are there more questions than answers because many of the answers could be provided if we actually had\nA the tax forms which\nSarah Huckabee Sanders pretty much gave us a reason to believe earlier this week\nWe we perhaps should not expect uh the reality is that this is not an area that Trump\nI desire to be transparent about and many of his supporters don't demand that he has I think there are people who are have noticed how much wealthier he has gotten since getting in\nUm the White House and and regarding specific uh businesses the feds or some of the um hotels have been rented out by international organizations perhaps wanting to I'm Kerry good favor with the administration\nUm and I think there are some people who are concerned about how that could influence a policy foreign policy specifically\nWell it's been four years since the fatal shooting of black teenager look climbed McDonald by officer Jason Van Dyke in Chicago this week marks the end\nOf that closely watched trial has the jury deliberate we're keeping an eye on the verdict come will keep you updated on any developments on that before we continue with surround up a quick word\nAbout next week the black lives matter movement which they will climb McDonald's case is definitely caught up in focus is on police shootings of African Americans and one of the most prominent voices in that movement will join us next week de ray ...\nHis new memoir called on the other side of freedom appeals for police reform and remind supporters of black lives matter\nWe'd like to know what questions you have about the black lives matter movement today or questions for ... he tried to turn his activism into elected office when he ran for mayor of Baltimore in twenty six team that did was unsuccessful but what does it say about wears a movement is and where should go\nShare your questions for activists during the cast and you can leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a\nWhat do you want to know about the black lives matter movement\nEight five five to three six one a one eight you can also use our new app won a vox pop where you can leave us a radio quality message or check in on future topics you'll find one vox pop V. O. X. P. O. P. in the app store and we will share our conversation\nWith their aim of tests and coming up next week on one a\nWhile to vote on the Senate floor has just happened were just double checking our numbers are out of what the vote total was again this is one of two votes that's involved in either getting Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court or not today's vote is a procedural vote to end the debate it's technically called cloture\nThe next vote would be the vote on whether or not senators would actually choose to put bread Tylenol on the U.S Supreme Court\nWe heard just a few minutes ago but Senator Susan Collins Republican of Maine\nWho might be a potential swing vote on this announced that she will side with her fellow Republicans on a critical past voted this cloture vote to end the debate we're just double checking our numbers right now want to make sure we have the exact right vote total and as soon as we have that\nWe will bring that to you for the moment we should get to one of Susan ... a ... she is literally leaping out of ...\nWell it looks like we have the votes now from all four of the undecided senators going into it at least on this cloture motion and interesting they Lisa Murkowski is the only one who's voted no show Joe Manchin that Democrat from West Virginia\nHas voted yes Jeff Flake has voted yes Susan Collins has voted yes now Susan Collins however previously announced she was voting yes on the cloture vote but not\nTo necessarily take that as an indication of her final stance on Kavanaugh because she this afternoon at three PM she will announce her final decision so we don't know necessarily what this procedural votes me but I think it's quite significant uh to see the Joe mansion yes vote in particular and the Lisa Murkowski no vote if those\nPositions where to hold up in the final vote on Kavanaugh he would be approved\nOn maybe ... senators who were struggling in and out of the room Steve Clemons once this cloture vote is done with eventually it will be done with what happens then what do we expect between this vote in the next one\nWell you'll have debate on the floor or that goes on and they'll bring that debate too close and they will set a time most likely tomorrow a and which they will a vote to confirm or not judge Kavanaugh\nAnd that time it it could be any time during the day or is there like a particular window hardly any time of day I mean one of the things about\nThis at it as it runs anytime I think one of the interesting things is you have\nA senator from Montana\nOr a Steve Gaines whose daughter is being married tomorrow getting married tomorrow and he wants to walk down the aisle so\nUshered his vote be absolutely necessary they have to wait for him to get back from Montana so it's one of those life uh intrusions into the way the system runs but my sense is that Mitch McConnell\nIs obsessed with getting this done moving on and getting people out campaigning and\nNoting this as a success that they've achieved that's why this is so unusual that feels raced pushed whether it's the FBI investigation which many people have been saying has not been an exhaustive did not go into many corners it's because the clock is ticking from Mitch McConnell and I think he wants to shelve this and get this done as soon as possible yeah\nNot one of these votes that you do one of these what you have to do in person there is no app for that so certainly his his uh his other life commitments could have a big impact the final vote total fifty one yes forty nine no and indeed as Susan said senators Collins flake and mentioned voted yes to suspend the debate and move on\nLisa Murkowski voted no but it seems like for the most part this was pretty much a party line vote Eugene Scott I I don't think that we really expected it to go any other way than being essentially a squeaker right on party lines\nI think everything just leading up to this moment suggested that even before the allegations against Kavanaugh became a public and I think uh there's a a ... a larger idea on that David Brooks tapped them\nOr to today and in his New York times piece about just how part is in the judicial branch has become um we talk often about activists judges um and concern that people on the bench are not making decisions and partially but\nWe haven't seen that be the case for a while now and they simply appears to be a continuation of that I mean if I if I may June\nIt was interesting to note that Heidi Heitkamp brother\nTweeted that she has to look at herself every day in the mirror and us chose to vote no even though he thinks it significantly increases the chances that she will lose her seat\nJoe Manchin the last time there was a reasonable poll in West Virginia is looking at Seventy percent of West Virginia is likely to vote support the Kavanaugh nomination to the broader side in terms of the tectonics and the parties as they look at trying to take the Senate where the Democrats taking the Senate\nIs also hedging on this that if mentioned were to be a no vote on Kavanaugh I think it it it very seriously could raise the stakes of him losing that states where there are different they're different issues here one is what what is the future prospects of\nA of the composite of the Senate look like with regards to this and despite the many many personal emotional and deep issues related to the Kavanaugh nomination itself in this lifetime appointment but\nMany people are looking at Heitkamp is now a in a much more endangered position um and this probably uh if if mansion follow through with his position on on the vote tomorrow increases the chances that he will survive in November shoes\nThere's no place you'd rather be on the golf course green grass blue

later today of the four key undecided vote that we were looking at three of them voted to advance Kevin along with Collins\nArizona Republican Jeff Flake voted for Kavanaugh as the Democrat Joe Manchin which is notable because he is right now the only Democrats supporting Kavanaugh's nomination\nLisa Murkowski of Alaska was a key no vote which surprised when people she had been on the fence all along she voted no so it's a party line vote except for mccaskey voting now with the Democrats and mentioned voting yes with the Republicans\nScott does this mean that Mr Kaplan I Will be on the Supreme Court\nLooks more likely than not right now but again we'll have a better picture later today I think Joe mansion in particular is going to come under tremendous pressure over the next few

A. M. U. dot org with regards to cyber hacking Michael asks with the loss and result in widespread dissemination of the CIA tool kit which allows one to spoof hacking from another country how can cyber bread crumbs lead to certainty that in other countries actually guilty\nDavid what do you think [noise] well cyber attribution is something that people are getting a lot better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems\nAh years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern part of a U.S\nBut the fact of the matter is that a combination of forensic evidence a motive past uses similar tools can get you most of the way most of the time so there are some pretty good\nQuestion facing many governments is once they've found this out and perhaps decide one ounce it as happened in these most recent cases then the political pressures on them so what do you do about it\nThat's why the president signed a new set of executive orders in um\nIn August we haven't seen them they're all classified that pushes down into the system\nOr the ability for commanders in the U.S to do cyberattacks back without having presidential sign off\nTill now that's been something that the only only the president authorized the use of nuclear weapons and cyber weapons now it's not entirely clear that only he can authorize the use of cyber weapons in retaliation but you want to make sure you're attribution pretty good before you strike back you know who to attack\nYeah great married before we move on\nFrom there first of all that is no small thing that that the U.S military might have the latitude unilaterally to\nShut down a power grid or turn off or you know hydroelectric dam through the Internet\nBut beyond that do we have a sense that certain countries certain organizations are getting a better handle on dealing with cyberattacks to world clearly hasn't figured this out\nIs anyone making progress I think about the ... because I hear so much about Internet regulations from there on a consumer level but on a military level is anyone making progress\nOr not that I'm aware of the U.S I think it's still the world leader in in in terms of you know advanced Internet abilities and and the threats are pretty clear or Russia or China and North Korea or Iran\nBut a ... figuring out or response in how you want to calibrate that response so it doesn't become this open ended escalation and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond or you're you're entering really uncharted territory\nVivian do we get a sense of countries beginning to kind of work together to figure this out to to figure out some kind of international response to cyber attacks or is Russia really got the whole world kind of running with the parents\nObviously what we've seen in the last couple of days of coordination as um indictments and ... you know raising these concerns about um sighing and otherwise obviously there's a lot of discussions that are taking place\nWhere countries our western allies trying to coordinate some kind of effort to counter the threat that that that the Russians posed but at the same time again you have so many ah restrictions and so many um uncertainty as to how to approach the cyber world in general on cyber threats\nTo really formulate some sort of attack plan or something to counter and to protect our infrastructure so that we don't have um we're not as vulnerable as we've seen ourselves\nIn the past but obviously you know the U.S is still trying to figure out a way forward and having looked at what happened to us in the two thousand and sixteen election still we're talking about the fact that we are vulnerable in two thousand Eighteen we could be vulnerable on twenty twenty so we haven't actually tried quite figured out how to protect ourselves get alone\nThe world's kind of coordinating on a global scale to do the same it's it's it's not an easy task\nAlthough it's funny kind of a decentralization of the way that we felt that we are so many different kinds of voting systems might in a way kind of how it helps allied health insulated from according to the fact that we've got all these different utility company yeah but you know dirt but but the key element here is we've done a better job at\nDiscussing internally how we would do counterattacks than we have organizing the world than the sort of digital Geneva Convention of what standards of what's on limits and often it\nLet's shift gears and talk about the Nobel Prizes particularly the Nobel Peace prize the winners were announced this morning Dr Denis ... and ... one for their work combating sexual violence as a weapon of war\nThe announcement from the Nobel Committee said in part quote Dennis ... look quite ... is to help or who has devoted his life defending these victims nutty a rod is the witness who tells the abuses perpetrated against herself and others\nWere rod is an Iraqi woman she was captured and held five Islamic state escaped captivity after three months and told to her story in a book called the last girl\nDr ... founded a hospital in eastern Congo that treated thousands of women many of whom are survivors of gang rape ... pretty extraordinary people to be winning the prize especially as we've learned more about how sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war and has for quite some time\nYeah really has to two individuals who seem really deserving the the peace prize has been a lot of had a lot of controversy in recent years very politicized\nA couple of people who really been thrust into dangerous situations handles it with with incredible courage and Dr ... up built this hospital in eastern Congo which is in the middle of nowhere just a very remote region\nTwenty years ago for maternal care there just isn't much health care of that was his intent but as the Congolese civil war metastasize I'm ray\nBut the various factions un peacekeepers were involved in in rape there and so he became the voice of rape being used as a weapon of war and so he's been asked this for Twenty years very prominent a voice but still operating in a very a a dicey region of very deserving winter\nI mean I I can really speak for the case of um ... who I I spend a lot of time in Iraq and two dozen Fifteen sixteen\nI'm interviewing ... women who were released from captivity from ISIS and the impact yeah obviously psychologically um physically or the the the use of sexual assault\nAnd rape as a tool in a war is obviously a huge thing but you have to also remember that these women go back to their\nTried to go back home a lot of their family shunned them because of cultural sensitivities to such things and so their lives are essentially up ended by this their families a lot of times don't take them back home a lot of these women were impregnated I'm as a result of this and had to really know where to go because\nThey were single mothers which in Iraq is is just\nCompletely a taboo and so uh you know it's something that you should raising awareness for
