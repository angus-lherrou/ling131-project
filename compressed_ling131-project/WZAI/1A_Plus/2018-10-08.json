better vote\nLike our lives depended on it in November and not let anything go to the Supreme Court if we can possibly help it\nShare and emailed I was behind judge Kavanaugh from the beginning of his confirmation for his stellar record and I am overjoyed that he's now an associate justice I Am one of the many many pro life women that the mainstream media seeks to always minimize both our numbers and our positions as women\nJohn rode on our Facebook page you catch soft sell this anymore which unwavering ...\nTrump Republicans are OK with philandering and sexual assault the only reason was Ford was not believed was because she was testifying against the Republican nominee the right didn't even listen to her and the FBI quote unquote investigation was a total sham and John ... investigation in quotation marks\nMuch and I didn't want to ask you about that in terms of\nWho was believed in this whole process set aside for a moment evident cheery question of whether the Senate should be thinking beyond a reasonable doubt like in court for or you know upon recently set that aside for for just a moment but just\nThe visceral way in which some people seem to be more believed than others what did you make of\nThat [noise] so this episode like so much and are highly highly polarized society um\nIs two completely different world views so when Democrats um both partisan Democrats any way I look at what happened with Kavanaugh they see a Republican Party that is ... that doesn't believe women that diminishes charges\nA sexual assault doesn't take them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode and ah and to the president himself and so forth so\nThat's their view um the the Republican view is that the allegation a of Christine Blasey Ford was even though it was held until the very last moment and they're they're very angry about the the process as um I Know this was saying\nBut they also point to the fact\nThat this accusation the Blasey Ford won was taken seriously was listen to but then it was roped in by many Democrats on the committee\nWith two other allegations that were so absurd that they should not have even pass the laugh test I'm the one by Julie sweat neck which she immediately walked back\nYou know that that there was some sort of raped gang going on in a in in but says the Maryland and the Nineteen eighties and to the students and that she is a college student was attending a lot of high school parties and saw Kavanaugh spiking the drinks have girls with ... and then attacking them well of course she she walked all of that back but\nUh and of course the Ramirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and we refuse to publish it so um so so the the problem was that when Michael ... sort of collard sweat neck and dragged her forward and included her absurd Alex\nOr um believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of ... of um making sleazy Ford's case all the weaker because it was seen to be part of this political hit\nAnd um and I think ... a may have a lot to answer for from his Democratic colleagues will\nThe president did also make some political have with Christine Blasey Ford's case or her story as well let me here's part of what you said\nAt a rally on Wednesday in Mississippi in an act of what he said was to help defend Brett Kavanaugh and his unfair treatment here's a bit of the president's kind of characterizing washing cars a generous word what professor Ford said to ...\nHow did he get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where I don't remember how many I don't\n[noise]\nI don't know\n[noise] I don't want I don't know what I mean that's the only thing [noise]\n\nAnd I met a man life is shattered\nPart of what the president's enemies rally last Wednesday in Mississippi it's worth noting that the president is incorrect in his assertion that all the professor for to remember was having one beer indeed she said that seared into her hippocampus clearly a psychology professor was the fact\nThat she was laughed at during the assault\nYes she also remember that it was upstairs I mean she remembered many things that President did not cover himself a glory in that moment where he was mocking current diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand\nUm there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this process that was also I'm really lemon trouble um stopping people in restaurants and and a driving a people are from the public square um\nUh you know accusing someone of um absurd\nCharges and not taking into account his whole life you know ... if judge Kavanaugh where the monster that ah that some of the Democrats had been portraying you would think somebody would have picked up on it at some point in his adult life\nWell and that's kind of what I'm Wondering in a way I hear you on that Mona El Yon also kind of noticed that one aspect of the debate around Brett Kavanaugh\nThe final analysis didn't get a lotta mentioned from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that like fifty minutes exploitation on the floor of the Senate which was actually rather fast moving toward hearing if you've ever heard it is just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something that awful that I knew I did not do\nI think I Would hope that I'd be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened it sounds like a tragedy I Wish I could give you the closure you're looking for but I'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of fell by the wayside\nYeah I Do think that once the additional allegations came out in ... in his testimony had to answer not just for a\nLousy Ford's allegation but also for the other two allegations and and he was upset angry in tears enraged are outraged on Democrats sort of their their arguments\nA became one not about necessarily guilt or innocence but one about temperament and did he have the appropriate temperament sit on the bench and it\nAh their argument necessarily uh it it became one not about do we believe her but then he doesn't have a judicial temperament and Republicans answered in turn that are Democrats had said he was to ... and the Fox interview and to detach and then when he got angry they thought that was in good enough\nI'm from a from a report ... perspective on that the temperament question was an interesting one to me it's sort of seemed to me from afar that looking at the justice says on the bench we know all of their politics are based on the president to a point that based on the way they ruled\nSo the temperament question was\n\nSupport comes from you and from

of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with you know step in LA on a Johnson and Mona chairing ... let me let you jump in and responsibility on his comment before we could go\nA little early on I mentioned that that Republicans I suffer in the midterms and that was a political sacrifice worth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in that political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen and that's a dangerous business you're\nAt but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiast and there's a twelve point\nUpward swing among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there this this hearing about fairness\nIt was about fairness for their husbands their fathers their sons on that a lot of blame moms who are are really scared about the standard that Mona mentioned right the idea that I single accusation\nWithout any kind of corroborating evidence is it not to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized that come out to the\nThis is no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including Gene Gene email urging contacted us and wrote\nThe accused two to five percent of the time than the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time\nWhen one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel is talking about our justice system is broken the women on your panel or making my blood boils ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nUh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization\nAnd I'm the only one I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment the comics wrote that one in four women in America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein and the shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in three and one in three women will deal with sexual violence it was a guy like not race that that's way overstated sexual violence of central\nSo and that's a very very broad description Dr includes even just being funneled over your clothes against their will\nSo right I should be careful with a number yeah go ahead and\nGo okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male sexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization all civilized society seek to cope with it\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because the it's it's very hard to prove and also we have to recognize that the consequences of finding a guilt at finding someone guilty of rape I mean\n... years and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's it but I don't see any way around you know keeping in mind our standards of justice and fair play and see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusations\nI feel like this is one of those moments early on as there were a lot of women including several who commented on this program not that I think that the show is a perfectly representative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said I don't want to hear it\nWe've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix this or we will shut you down\nMona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics earlier and I I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get better\n[noise] well I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the Kavanaugh confirmations presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in the court of law and the question raised and it was should he a\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no he should uh have the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and not seemed not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that uh there certainly is energy on the left but it is met\nWith equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation and saying that\nUh men should base a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled was sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but covering this as a reporter that is simply a sort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court bar should note that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical about the process over all I mean this was very high political theater in some ways when you get down to it and that was kind of the reflection of one listener who just left a note in our inbox\nMy name is far I'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio I'm very disappointed\nCheck and our Congress and I'm very disappointed with the United states at this time than the African American woman I really do feel that it was all up the joke that they what they hiring doors and say okay let's get the country a

no really take the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right word some sushi will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate ... gets to something that senator Collins of Maine Susan Collins of Maine\nTalked about her long exploitation explaining why she was going to vote for\nBrett Kavanaugh and some of his background particularly as it relates to dealing with presidents on the Supreme Court she mentioned roe versus Wade very specifically what what's your read on whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will tried the court kind of as Irwin suggested to the far right\nLook I'm because he's replacing Anthony Kennedy I think there will be a shift the right on the court um I think it will be much more measured than some art claiming\nI'm I think it's really unlikely that you see roe versus Wade something like overturned precedent overturn I think it's much more likely that we see some narrowing of the precedent on abortion allowing states I'm a little bit more leeway to regulate abortion and the second and third trimester as I think that's more likely outcome on those issues\n\nYou're listening to Cape and die in the ...

A. M. U. dot org\nKatie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform I Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you\nIf you would just explain what we mean when we talk about redistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering\nSo this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the descending you'll senses\nOf the census really starts the whole process of the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives\nThe states the official number of uh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get there's a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method\nWhich I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state all fifty states get one\nMember of the house of representatives at least you know there are four hundred and thirty five so that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington he'll method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well uh but then it does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth ah and that's how we figure out\nThat ah say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on\nUh the population shift and the relative populations of each state\nSo this happens every ten years and then every ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways uh some legislatures have challenged\nUh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power ... other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various quirks here and there are and uh the legislatures will then draw\nThose maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty or that the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows\nPretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks\nIm Andrew Young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate a in crazy ways in ways that\nAre where the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and you know throughout the years\nOr every state has gone through its own hiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we're going to see thrown around a lot of in this next redistricting\nYeah North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing the district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform\nIt I think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states of Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress of both parties\nTo Washington to accept the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrat's who Washington\nA Democrats have only been successful in flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb seat and the special election in two thousand Seventeen\nSo when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swing states you also see this as as well as the state legislative level so you have all of these states\nThat are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that Democrats may often when more votes state wide for it chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority\nIn both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override the actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it insulate members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular\nUm you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation um and and it also discourages competition in a lot of these states in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went without a major party\nCompetitor so voters had no choice and almost half of their districts here because folks\nTook a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nTo get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience as hottest hottest topics including with Michael wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballots are fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election ain't that a load of crap\nThat's also the same in North Carolina Laura by the way we did a program a while back\nIn February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online we have some gerrymandered districts and we want it to see if you could tell the difference between the map of gerrymandered district and an ink blot on a ... test\nYou can find that quiz if you search the words gerrymandering G. E. R. R. Y. M. A. N. D. E. R. I. N. G. it was a program that aired this February you'll find that on our website the one a dot for\nKatie let me come to you talk about voters not politicians I understand that this was a redistricting initiative that got started after you were trying to find some way to be politically active but not overtly hyper partisan and this is something that galvanized people around you right\nYeah um I accidentally started a political movement with a Facebook post as after that too many sixteen election uh before\nSupport for example you ca I come from you and from the Cape and islands license plate

politicians David daily senior fellow at fair vote and the author of the upcoming book the rising and read Wilson national correspondent for the hill a couple of you wrote us to respond to lower his message about Pennsylvania's redrawn maps\nNot being in place for this year's election\nMark writes that the new Pennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle Steve writes the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get us fair districts somewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures look at the old seventh congressional district\nThankfully the new districts are enforced for twenty eight team in some of ...\nYet looks like a goofy and Donald Duck facing one another's seriously just Google it speaking of which Maurice tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion world he sent us a link to a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com\nMrs they say gerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of voting districts than North Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district Louisiana six Florida fourth Michigan fourteenth\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry a hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states\nWe got a lot of comments read about the role of Republicans\nIn gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current map it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIs that fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what\nDo we know well the Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and how they were Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates\nBack in twenty Seventeen the way of Virginia elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nA but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which\nIs sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives uh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the no party is blameless in this\nUh gerrymandering started we get the word from a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts\nUh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed\nAll of the federal at members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those still existed today a isn't to win all the districts around it uh the a newspaper ... and in Boston\nTook a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander ... that's how we actually get the word\nYou could argue that some of this happened back in in a feeding and democracy back in you know five hundred BC uh but when we talked about\nToday yeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south that were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially\nIn the state of Maryland uh there's one district or out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes both parties do this\nRepublicans have done it a more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about a fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the wines aren't fair and therefore are are probably\nThe ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish\nThe fact that that these lines may not be fair\nBut the people who who ... tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nWe do get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the G O P is going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to redistricted by a nonpartisan commission\nSlow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts in the shape of a pencil\nJoanne wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court was a majority appointed by Republican governors and approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership than killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and say so publicly\nKatie faith he I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had with folks that you've been witness to folks kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel\nPractically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nMy experience has been that um I mean in Michigan that we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drying process so maybe that helps that we have volunteers who are Democrats\nThat what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan the really common sense things that we all look to government to at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know we there's also a Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still Republicans who live in those districts and so their voices aren't heard\nOr because a lot of these races are happening in the primaries and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level of Michigan we're a lot of people talking about even if they're the of fish all that is there um representative as the party they leg they're much more extreme than what they would like to see\nAnd so I think that in Michigan in particular people have just had enough we feel like our government's doing a lot of overreach and want to help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the\nLeast transparent states when it comes to transparency in government\nUm and that's the biggest thing we heard while you're doing those town hall is a lot of people saying you know I don't know why these lines are being drawn than eight years later some emails coming out a talking directly about how the lines were drawn to guarantee one party an advantage or another", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Brewster", "day": "08"}
