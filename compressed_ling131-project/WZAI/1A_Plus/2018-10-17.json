I think it could be if we don't realize the moments are the moments that we're in I remember vividly when a when director Mahler gave that speech where out in uh in in the Pennsylvania area it was the first major speech\nOn cyber as a national security threat think about that it's now considered\nBy the director of national intelligence all the major officials to be the top threat it was only around ten years ago that we even talked about it seriously from the director the FBI for the first time I know you have like a a guest on later a number of former Justice Department person Monica vicar from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that tests\nW sea ice is standing members helped

perspective of a company like someone's stealing customer information names addresses the type a day in day out thing that you were talking about earlier\nHowever in this case he wasn't doing it to make five hundred bucks although he did ask for five hundred bucks [noise] he also through bitcoin you also on the back end had become friends with one of the most notorious terrorist in the world a British born citizen name due date Hussein he became friends with them only through Twitter only on line\nAnd what he did with that stolen customer information that was provided to turn it into the kill list that said using this customer information\nAre located from his safe hole and Rocca ah Syria he bombarded back to the United states through social media a list of the stolen customer information and said kill these people by name by address where they live that's the new era of national security that that we're in we're criminal\nThreats merge or blend with terrorists and national security threats and companies the private sector is on the front lines for the first time\nMichelle emailed as a person of a certain age I recall a world that function before the digital age are total reliance on digital information is making us less safe were trading safety for convenience\nI Wonder John as Michelle has a point there used to be a time when you had to actually go to the bank to Rob it and now you don't\nShell definitely in fact one of the cases we talked about is an Internet a bank heist a where hackers managed to send human operatives to ATM machines all across the world in different countries and they used a hack\nTo simultaneously allow them to withdraw money for me as from ATMs I think Michelle does have a point you know for twenty five years\n\n\n\nThis station

your Facebook account\nThe most recent hack of the social media giant compromise about thirty million users names phone numbers emails and other personal details\nFacebook says last month attackers found a vulnerability in the code and use Facebook's view as feature to steal access tokens these tokens or bits of code that let you love right in without having type your password every time it gave them whoever they are access\nTo nearly everything your user name which devices you access Facebook with\nThe last ten places you checked into or were tagged at\nAnd personal details that you posted like your religion your hometown\nYour birth date where you work yeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account now the company and the U.S\nAnd this year Facebook's chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress that his company needs to raise its game\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company\nFor most of our existence we focused on all the good the connector and people can do and if Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful neutral for staying connected to the people they love for making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and at the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica bigger she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions of new post every day or so the first day we become aware is if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the site if you do it comes through and it's reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might violate our policies so for instance terror propaganda\nNow we remove of the terror propaganda that we remove from face that's more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flags it for us\nNow once content has been flagged as potentially violating our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on those content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages\nAre and making a decision if it violates the policy and ... if it doesn't violate the policy believe that\nThat's got to be a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area the person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise\nWe have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire hunting reviewers who speak all different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have native language speakers because they really ...\nBig focusing are hiring once you're hired as a constant review or you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in one so for instance you'll learn all about um [noise] our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm threats of self harm when\nYou catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook to violate terms what's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it is the kind of thing that say a reviewer or bought would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook\nDeals with it we still rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on the side\nThat said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag violating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well in a couple of areas where it harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda\nI'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can slide the vast majority of that content before anybody in the community send it to us or sees it at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery\nOr terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very can textual for instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university\nAnd and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the words I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns how does that pattern recognition work well we do so most of our policies are about content that people are posting\nBut we do have some policies that are focused on\nActors themselves for instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we will remove your account even if you're not otherwise violating our contact policies we also have policies against\nTerror organizations and our members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance want it to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens in ...\nDon't allow those groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it's a page that's represent an al ... or it's a page that has been created for the purpose of bullying somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us\nThe reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that's going to come through to our review teams first and so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that what's going to come through our reviewers and they'll be able to take immediate action\nAlso worth noting if you were a mobile use or like if if you're an iPhone use or if you just have one comment directly sometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or lie or copy and then there's other options and in those other options there's an option to report somebody I Wonder\nHow much Facebook is facing the learning curve of a world that is learning to use Facebook know decides designed to be intuitive I think it is increasingly intuitive the more you use it and because you're global you've got people in some parts of the world who are just beginning for the first time\nTo have broadband devices or to be connected to a world where there are more devices and our people house Facebook teaching people to use Facebook\nWe definitely do outreach but you're right at different in different parts of the world people will have different levels as experience and finding these reporting options and even just

Joshua Johnson in Washington wonder Native American voters thinking about for the midterms\nMuch more than what's happening with Senator Elizabeth Warren and President Trump their ongoing feud over Warren claiming to have tribal ancestry the senator has addressed her heritage in the past including at this year's National Congress of American Indians\nI kept why some people think they're hated being made here\nYou won't find my family members on any rules and I'm not enrolled in a tried and I want to make something clear I respect that distinction\nI understand that tribal membership is determined by tribes and only by tribes my mother's family was part Native American and my daddy's parents were bitterly opposed to their relationship\nNow in the scheme of things does it matter if Senator Warren really is a verifiable tribal heritage\nClearly does to her especially after the president referred to her as Pocahontas and said he would give a million dollars to the charity of her choice if she could prove or ancestry that apparently led to senator to take a DNA test who's results she says prove that she is Cherokee\nThat drew criticism from tribal leaders like the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior who spoke on MORNING edition\nUm and then we're now at the point where she has taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nMeans by which you are a turkey citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for a senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political\nA fight or to talk about DNA I really undermines tribal interest frankly\nOn top of that the test did nothing

important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community is one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important ... one of the things I Love to think about as a shoney's once hunted bastard on\nHunted mastodon\nHunted best it I think about that long arc\nYeah yeah I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back\nMillennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture\nAre there other kinds of benefits that you find whether they're intrinsically extra benefits\nOf being an acknowledged member of a tribe that are worth protecting that are worth keeping their proper places I mean Carol talked about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our our our children are native languages are traditions are land the water\nAnd the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA test is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native\nYou know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it\nThey take our language and they ... they take our spirituality and modify it and they make money\nThey make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of their family lore or they speak with them mugging titled meant\nLike they've lived the life of a native like somebody's ever called them an engine or a our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies at the door\nEven if it's Elizabeth Warren\nShould know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kits the ones that say find out your ancestry and learn what your families\nSeventeen we did it on October Eighteenth of last year called ... where do we come from where we spoke to a geneticist\nNamed Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about what DNA can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you were going to do one of these home DNA test\nYou'll find that conversation with Adam Rutherford on our website the one a dot org that's the word the the number one bullet or a dot org\nBrittany tweeted I Am a county and kick Hanukkah or mohawk\nAnd I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help native issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nUA progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focused on this\nYou would progressive she must have known why we both Kerry living because we're going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you would progress was brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell North Dakota has\nA voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court decided to essentially let it go into effect for the November election so what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us rap Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger\nPolls have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve setting the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American\nAnd so this voter id law\nCould potentially fall heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed it because they said that that north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nSo what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have the\nDresses and those addresses are no longer sufficient so if you have\nID but it carries a mailing address a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that I Do you use in the primary is no longer good for the general election\nA lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has that been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about it as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also\nBecause the the state has argued that a mailing address doesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot\nSomeone could use a mailing address and and even added vertically vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast a ballot and the wrong precinct would would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if your mailing address is somewhere different than where you actually reside would\nLove to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population there reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether you are in North Dakota or elsewhere love to hear from your your North Dakota but email is one a act W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one a or comment on our Facebook page\nJerry what did you hear from people in North Dakota about how this law is affecting them is this on people's radar as this kind of more of a a a smaller issue\nI'd say it is and also you have to put it against the larger contact\nOr you see it as it is a is a big issue or just a small\nI think it's really on people's radar absolutely an issue and I also think there's some context around it when I was reporting from North Dakota from the Standing Rock reservation\nAnd NPR coverage that frankly you can't find anywhere out if you appreciate WBAI local and national election coverage considers deporting in Cape and islands dinosaurs [noise]\nSupport comes from you and from some of the academy with an admission information session on Saturday at one student led tours followed by conversation with students and faculty\nFound that the economy or kids not only fit in they stand out registration and found that the academy dot org and from members of our founders circle who's generosity keeps double UCI strong and independent including Margaret Molly Johnston and Marilyn chaperone\nOur thanks to you and to all our members for the generous supportive your local NPR station\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from super featuring the all new three row was sent with feeding for up to eight and a choice of second row captain's chairs love it's what makes us Subaru\nDot com from Fidel any investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learned more finality dot com slash wealth finality brokerage services El Al ... and from Americans for the arts\nTomorrow we'll continue our conversation about the mid term elections with a national look at major races and issues we booked a great panel but we could use your help to focus the discussion what are your main questions and your main concerns about the midterms candidates polls voter turnout controversies or anything else\nLeave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one a one a which we talk about tomorrow when we talk about the midterms on a national level it's eight five five to three six one two one two\nYou can also send us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop you can download the app that's V.

A. M. U. dot boards perhaps one of the candidates it's on your radar is Debra Haaland who joins us by phone to talk about her experiences\nShe's a democratic nominee for New Mexico's first congressional district and she has a Pueblo of Laguna citizen Deb welcome to want to\nThank you so much why are you what what made you decide to run for Congress\n[noise] well I've been involved in politics in New Mexico for a number of years and I was just finishing up my term is the state chairwoman of the Democratic party of New Mexico and I just felt that I wanted to continue to\nUh work for my state and worked for the the people I Love here and so uh the seat opened up and I I felt that um I Would have a good chance of winning\nAnd so I decided to run to be a strong voice for the people of New Mexico\nNo New Mexico's first district just looking on the map that includes Albuquerque and some of the areas south east of New Mexico is that right\n[laughter] so well there's some areas north and there's some there's some areas east and West is two tribal communities and the district Sandia Pueblo and the ... a Navajo Nation chapter [laughter]\nSo um so it does it geographically it's not large but it has a very diverse population so that's\nGreat now if you win next month's that would make you the first Native American congresswoman in American history ... would that mean to you\n[noise] well of course what I always say is that I Can't speak for my tribe or any tribe but ... my perspective growing up uh in to a ... a woman uh with my my mom and my\nOur culture and traditions and just understanding you know having worked for several tribes and and understanding about the issues and the challenges that we face a which incidentally are are the same as a lot of other places\nIn New Mexico and across our country so I just feel like having that perspective at the table\nWill mean you know something um something good for a for our country a voice that we haven't yet heard\nGive us a sense of what some of those issues are that might be affecting tribal populations in your district that you'd like Congress to pay more attention to or deal with differently\nSure sure well of course you know there's always housing\nOh that's always an issue for a lot of tribal communities but it's also an issue for a lot of rural communities across our state as well\nUh we are on in my campaign I have a I have we've made renewable energy I'm pretty much the number one issue that I'm campaigning on\nAnd I think that uh that would create thousands of jobs for the district and not just in the in the city of Albuquerque but in the rural communities so um so that's one thing turtle communities always always care tremendously about our education system\nAnd so that's something that that is high on my list as well as well as health care right we\nWe have of our population here in New Mexico's medicate eligible that includes uh the twenty two tribal communities that we have here in the state and so uh that's always a an important issue as well\nWe're speaking to dip hauling the Democratic nominee for New Mexico's first congressional district she is the ... of Laguna citizen ... I I have no context for dealing with tribal populations in politics and you said there is quite an array of diversity among the tribes that would that you would be representing\nIn Congress can you give folks just a sense of what it's like to try to represent the issues of all those different groups do you find that there is a handful of issues the kind of overlap every one or do you really have to be sensitive to what this tribe is asking for versus what does that tribe is asking for and and we're the differences are\nSure I mean I think there's some of that ... ... absolutely there's there you know they'll they'll be some competing issues along the way but but really I'm land water uh our environment is all\nBut ... those are issues that transcend um you know tribal lines so to speak issues that that all of us are concerned about and so I'm so I'm I'm a lifelong environmentalist and you know I I'm a I'm somebody who used to go down to the\nTo the field with my grandfather and weeds and pick worms off of corn\nUm so I Know I understand the value of clean water and clean land to our people and I think that is that's an issue that transcends a lot of tribes across the country um but\nYou know the issues you were talking about earlier with voting that that is that's definitely an issue that all of us care about as well because we deserve\nA to have a voice at the table that's something I've been fighting for for\nA long time I've I've been getting out the vote in Indian communities for nearly Twenty years because I've always felt that we should have a say in who are elected officials are so um so that's a passion of mine as well and and I want to work to make sure that that our voices are always heard in that respect\nI don't want to keep you too much longer but I Do wonder what you make of this larger surge of Native American candidates this year ... what do you think is behind that\nJust stuck but I ...

the dashboard don't say a word\nOfficer knelt down and lifting your window when I saw your face so close to his gun I wanted to snatch it and watch it melt into black grits evidence police started approaching me more often and Mississippi I wanted to super power to melt every gun in the world and the black grits officer asked why we had in Mississippi license plates\nBecause we are residents of Jackson, Mississippi you say I have a post doctoral appointment at the University of Maryland College park have I done anything wrong officer\nWhen officer told you to speak up and claim your change lanes without signaling you kept your grip on the steering wheel and said I did not change lanes without signaling you spit up behind me Celeste signaled and changed lanes officer tried to laugh in your face as he asked for your license in registration\nIs that your man he asked you he needs to show some identification to\nYour hands came up to staring well and you pointed at the officers face move away from my car you said that as much as he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification may I have your badge number please I hate it how it sounded when you didn't use contractions the office to ask both of us to step out of the car\nWe will not get out of his car you said louder this time\nWe have done nothing wrong my fist were bald up and I was ... toward the driver's side window you slapped me across my chest with the back of your hand and told me to be quiet and unconscious office right as another officer pulled up the first officer who's now laughing walk back to the second officers car\nYou eventually shelled a second officer your license and your University of Maryland id\nOfficer looked at the id flipped it over and told us to have a good night\nNever give them a chance to take a shot you finally said after we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it they will take it I wondered why you set it three times and why you never told me to shoot back\nMississippi Marilyn it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot Joe Black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you kill yourself\nI hear you I told you and try to make you laugh why didn't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't and they instead of their though\nIf I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us you said oh you wouldn't I told you that fool got mad because us\nI mean like you were thinking you might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English they view though\nI Do not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you I'm an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop gave me the bubble goods you laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't\nWhile I was in my room change and you told me to write about what I learned from the experience with the police I wasn't sure what the right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seemed like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cutting a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky and the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting\nThey were just the only people allowed to walk around and threaten us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style of flying\nI loved our style of fly\nOut of their eggs are heavy psyche essay lame and there is a lot going on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it\nYeah I mean that's the crust of a lot of\nThe relationship I talk about in this book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to had to go to a new school in eighth grade was first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd a few my best friends from a previous school were there and one of my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way he did every morning when we were at a school in Jackson\nAnd long story short you know a teacher a eventually told and put the knife away treated the knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers\nAnd in that situation I learned that sometimes in off in a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so ah my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not giving them a chance to look like\nEat in a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out to the library without checking it out that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure about\nYou move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to the home life when you spend your entire life outside at home anticipating white supremacy and white power doing un that's the question I'm trying to ask an infection and also in the entire book\nWhat did happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom as you were trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you were trying to understand them how did that affect your relationship with her\nYou know one one way I think a lot of just traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful that my mother was telling me things some things that were raised some things that were wrong\nUm she started to be a ... a a lot more active and trying to police me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more [noise]\nUm but and we could talk about those things sorted we could talk about police we could talk about why people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about with like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different relationship\nBut I Would never talk to her about that finding that protection she saw me in relationships that were like difficult for me where I was being bad to myself when I was mistreated people emotionally we didn't know how to talk about any of it so while we're doing really good sort of at talking about how we survive outside of the house\nThe particular kinds of violence as they were happening in my house were completely silent we never knew how to talk about it and so you know it took me until I was forty two forty one years old to have the guts to actually write into some of what was happening in our house and try to connect that to what was happening outside of our house", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Brewster", "day": "17"}
