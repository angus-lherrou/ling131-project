criminal record beforehand but you know he was\nHeard by witnesses and did according to a complaint later tell swat officers who are removing him from the scene and he was you know yelling very anti

a quick clarification for somebody that came up earlier we had a comment referring to one\nOf the victims of the shooting in Pittsburgh referencing her as a Holocaust survivor one of the victims who was Ninety seven years old rose ...\nThere's been some reporting on this ... wasn't ... not a Holocaust survivor so some of those stories have been\nCorrected however there was a Holocaust survivor who was on the scene and narrowly escaped being caught up in the mass shooting Judas summit\nWas a few minutes late to synagogue vet date but was in the area of the tree of life congregation in Pittsburgh when the shooting took place who just wanted to correct that before we move on again this is a fast moving breaking story best to keep an eye out on NPR dot org for the very latest or on your NPR member station\n[noise] how do we prevent accused of sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein ... from silencing the people the abuse among other things some states are passing new laws that prohibit certain kinds of confidentiality agreements\nAssistant to the Hollywood mobile and she says some of the current laws protect criminals\nPerkins left Weinstein's company Miramax back in Nineteen Ninety eight after a colleague revealed that winds dean had tried to rape her last year Perkins broke her confidentiality agreement after about Twenty years of keeping her co worker secret here she is in an interview with the BBC\nI understand that no disclosure agreements have the ... and ... the ... side um but it's way too many important legislation has changed around how these agreements and ... you cannot have an equal document that attack at criminal\nMany state lawmakers agree with ms Perkins this year in the wake of the meats un time's up movement Tennessee Vermont and Washington state among others passed laws banning certain kinds of confidentiality agreements other states including Maryland and California passed laws that expands sexual harassment protections to workers like freelancers\nIt's another example of states taking action while Congress makes promises and remains deadlocked\nToday will discuss these new state laws and what impact they could have workers and employees it's the final part of our special series this state where in where we've been focusing on the bills and initiatives that are trending in state capitals\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center the organization administers the time's up legal Defense Fund which assists with sexual harassment cases Emily welcome back to when a\nThanks for having me joining us from the University of Oregon is Elizabeth tip it an associate professor at Oregon law school she's also a former employment lawyer Elizabeth welcome\nThanks for having me and Suzanne held seen as the program director of the employment labor in retirement program at the national conference of state legislatures in Denver Suzanne thanks for making time for us\nYes thanks ... we'd also like to make time for you particularly if you've had experience with sexual harassment sexual abuse and felt like the law did or did not protect you if the law did not protect you in your state\nWhat went wrong or perhaps what did the laws in your state do write\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover and who don't they cover so when you look at workplace section\nSeven as the federal law that says that you can't discriminate the basis of sex and that includes harassing people on the basis of sex\nBut title seven only covers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees so if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment laws\nShoes and hold the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to more workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states are expanding protections and who they're covering\nYeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduced legislation in twenty Eighteen\nOn workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states are have introduced legislation as it relates to limiting or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or ending forced arbitration agreement so we've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York\nTennessee California as you mentioned Vermont in Washington\nAnd other states are also looking addict standing training requirements um so how many hours messed a employees are employers um require training and so we've seen legislation on that pass in um California is just one example of that\nElizabeth tipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws\nWe heard from ... ear is already who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once Wal singing in a band and once while working as a tutor she says she could not report the incidents to a chart and as a contract worker she had no employer to sue\nI thought about it and I was like I don't want to post that on my social media it it can change your reputation I really wish I could have protecting myself in both situation there just I feel like I Would have had a sense of agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nFrustrated with how common is this for freelancers in the in the situation\nI Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive to provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors\nOh so even basic protections ah like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaints system the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nWere speaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law Susan whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures\nAnd Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I Love you to react to a comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am a Florida based graduate student at Boston University\nThis year ... required all students all staff and all faculty to complete a sexual assault training course I had no idea how many legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian\nMuch less where to look\nEmily this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have\nPassed laws expanding sexual harassment training and the education requirements for for some employers\nThat is true we have seen this year and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of workplace harassment which is exciting that they've been creative\nUm will to bear thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on is\nRequiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there is no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected what sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior\nSo one of the things that I Hope comes from this long overdue attention she workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in a workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor to but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean there's a certain kinds of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment well when you think\n[noise]

about so called me to legislation trends in New state laws the name to strengthen protections against sexual harassment\nWas Emily Martin of the national Women's Law center Suzanne whole scene of the national conference of state legislatures\nAnd University of Oregon law school assistant professor associate professor Elizabeth tip it's we welcome some more of your questions and thoughts as well especially if the laws in your state that deal with sexual harassment sexual abuse worked for you or failed you we love to hear your story or even just your questions about the way these laws work\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one eighty or email won a a W. A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reaction to what we heard from California state senator ... and so I was like ... California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think\nI agree that California's been a real leader in the face those with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session\nAs well as if you love that unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim\nYou know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that\nIs not enough time often for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action so you know we joined the national Law Center joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week\nCalling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nHere is that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a pass new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement as a condition of coming to work that would ah\nKeep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and so we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution\nSuzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and\nAnd and introduce a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that I did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that\nProvides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment of workplace in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitation laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find the conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously I Wonder if we could dig into the line of where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Dennis wrote on our Facebook page\nThere is a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however it is a disservice to our communities when they're used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\n[noise] yes well that's interesting and I will say that states or not\nI these contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just called them contracts um or other types of agreements most of the legislation that we've seen\nUs specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily band nondisclosure in great agreements and hold but just as it relates this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nProfessor typically ... before we move on to too much for there can you just define that term force what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do well\nThere's actually two types there's the type that you mentioned that people sign at the start of their employment that says keep our information confidential and there was another type of people find usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they've hired a lawyer\nAnd those are to settle the person's legal claims and those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct has occurred or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts on their line that case\nFor someone who stick with you from it I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or help for hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there maybe some contradictions\nWith federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nFor the contracts that you sign up the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes clear that those can't cover sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract\nThat keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that so the contracts in a way educate the employees about their rights it's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person who's represented by a lawyer\nAnd I've heard plaintiff lawyers say that they like these provisions 'cause it's move the path toward the settlement\nAnd I think that's kind of hard about this is the people who maybe have the most interests and learning us information aren't at a table future back then potential victims of harassment they don't have a say and whether the victim and the employer decided to keep the information secret\nWas because of some of your comments and questions Alex tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier luckily we have to\nWe all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on email to my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for a work conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution do laws across state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise helped bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on\nWell that's a great question if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond federal light yes there can be complicated questions that arise if the person is usually employed in one state about the harassing or assaulting behavior was in and out there\nBut it's important to remember that we're talking about state lot stay in the ways in which states are going above and beyond federal protections there are core federal protection they should be strengthening various lead that their core federal protections against workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment in schools and so that is a baseline that covers\nEverybody would be important exemptions that we've talked about that no matter you know what is it because they live in\nA suicide I'd love to get your take on one of the states that did not pass at least one of its proposed bills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven eight would have stopped employers\nFrom forcing workers to settle sexual harassment disputes through arbitration state representative Raymond cruise voted against the bill among other things the rep said it would open up litigation for everything\nFor definitely UCA I come from you and and as

U. dot org\nToday we're looking at a surge in early voting across America with the help of three stations we're partnering with Zoe Clark is the program director at Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor Michigan she's also the co host of its program it's just politics so we welcome Joshua joining us from UNC public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Dallas\nMichael glad to have you with us Hi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is reporter Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happen to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas\nWith regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth so a court in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase over the last midterm elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges if I had the ... turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during the presidential election so we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTony fourteen we had six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in the state\nMichael do you want and what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them\nAnd more expected this morning we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day and on election day and um uh it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots\nAnd Brian ... what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's so many of the counties across the state of reporting a\nRecord or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they are Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know ah there's they request in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county by near Kansas City ah they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nLet me stick with you how does early voting work in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through out of Kansas handle voting early well it depends\nCounties away they decide um obviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request that you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas uh we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters would like to take that option\nWe heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research candidate amendment or proposition at leisure welcome pleading the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado how's ... how this early voting work\nWell uh basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you you got to do a lot of research in Colorado this year it is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here in Colorado and\nFill out that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or or\nSome other kind of relaxing recreational or some kind of a cup of tea my whatever you want to ... ...\n... um you know and so uh you know a lot of people I'm like this system in Colorado but not everyone um you know that ... ... ... the world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm a you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already I'm now you've got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting\nI'm Glad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received November six times and I I don't know how it is for your three states but every state I've lived in election day is a day your ballot has to be in not just the day that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that if you don't mind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be\nOn election day not a postal carriers hands on election day buddy gets some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early Mitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my vote to be cast exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take backs\nRitual is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry about long lines or work or travel on election day that would prevent my voice being hurt ...\nTweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day ... do you have to lie to vote early and Michigan\nFor all practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to ah basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say I'm going to be out of town\nAnd and lie there are also some other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be a over sixty years old or another is may be due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment or trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot\n... what is being over sixty has to do with voting early\nAh possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's gonna be cold and maybe the idea is that if you know you don't want to Seventy eight year old having to to\nSit outside let's say in a wheelchair for three four hours and wait to vote so that is one a one way that that you can get an absentee ballot\nWe're speaking to Philly Clark program director at Michigan Radio based in Ann Arbor Michael do you want
