you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it but I loved it for the entertainment value but my big piece that loan that when he brought her on stage ... that was not her ... her down knowing what she'd been told that she wasn't going to be good enough\nOr attractive and she just went out and she killed it and they loved it and for that has second ac that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her now those are pretty important moment if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself out there for the same reason is kind of a big moment\nYeah I I I hear you on that just does that resonate for you in a way like was there something personal that that made you flash back to er sad about for ...\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know I Do a lot of things where I have to go out in front of crowd or for people and you often hear you know ... dinner or project lower or beat this or that are younger and at that moment with kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that moment\nThat we can personalize it whether it's your interview or what have you and I think that was an important or with\nHeather what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her nose\nYes [noise] yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and uh for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she was like this is my notes listening all needs to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got them to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and I thought it it kind of the deal\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that Ali billboard and he says we should have just made bowl billboard your nose\nI think the thing about the comments about her nose is also a guy guys\nBarbra Streisand [laughter] and one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist in and thrive\nIn Hollywood as far as coming on the music industry it absolutely is of a powerful comment on the music industry\nAs the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing has placed in time where this movie is place in time it's interesting to think about that\nBecause almost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's really no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming and playlists and um the major record labels having less\nPower than they used to so it's almost like old fashioned and its view of the music industry but\nFor this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also try to end but by the way for those who have not seen star is born will not be seeing stars ... just kind of want to be in on the conversation she tells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose you know just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go when the homes I Wonder how you view the commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie I felt\nLike I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art I also thought about pink\nWho's very much and invention of pop music but who also have this kind of rye cynical style style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways is very linear it's a very linear idea of there is the one I'm rose to fame there is one path you just simply offend or D sand as opposed to\nThere is no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWith out kind of going through that traditional path so I agree with and about that but I think that um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them pass each other\nOn this fame ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about Lady Gaga you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who has been so able\nTo make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean the funny thing about this movie is she is way more important to culture than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from\nIt's more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right and it's odd and that way\nYeah except for that voicing rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diverse but you're right I mean he is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley spent a lot of time sitting up that first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga character alley is just improvising love so\nAnd they found a\nA two time can do\nTo me [noise]\n\n... [noise]\nPretty good Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in a star is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano and sang and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we sang together I mean everything's ... recently saying everything live in the movie wow you know there's nothing we're not just lives thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's seen next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in a scene is actors fully believing that you're the character you can't not believe it yourself so she really gave me the confidence\nBradley Cooper speaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration between Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga particularly how it came out in the way the love story played\nOut this is my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meets jak he was a stumbling blackout drunk and I think it looks as if he's just spend a weekend at a bar do Kevin Cavanaugh KCUR\n\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and\nBanking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in

Powers Linda Holmes and John horn let's get to a few more of your calls now gene is listening in Indianapolis he Jean what did you think of a star is born\nHeater gene can you hear me yes I have a five stars which why five stars\n[noise] um actually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one scene particularly well updated to today um\nI thought it was the the irony of her being discovered\nBecause he was a drunk and looking for a drink\nAnd their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was the continuing thing and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent I guess he was her agent uh the guy who made her over the manager do agent played\nYeah what what is your main character\nI didn't like him and I I guess I wasn't supposed to but ah the minute he had that conversation with jacks and um\nAnd and basically getting ready to accuse the ... are accusing him of being a problem in that whole relationship I just I just knew that that was going to be the start as of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear Eugene a hundred percent of ... and I I figure I heard your charming and as well\nNo that was a male nominee go yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of this story one of the tricks with the manager and I think they do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is\nI'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them\nBut then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so I think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forced element that\nIt doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed it because when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate and a lot of different ways for sure but\nYou know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough to drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was\nI agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell and there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happened or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on to say to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way from like\n... exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of the the narrative issue with the ending\nWas oh go ahead and go well of course of course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine or the same monster as Lady Gaga once called it and one of her albums a destroys people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of stars born in there and in fact all the bridges of the stars weren't have that manager character in a different embodiment um that character in this film I\nAbsolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost with a sympathetic enabler um of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know we're\nEsther Esther was the first name a valley and the stars foreign versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of being part of the cast you know has to be there um\nI also just want to say before we end gotta get this out there that um\nThis is also the story of how\nA woman's arise leads to a man's fall [laughter] and that's an internal problem with the stars bar and you know um it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama is traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nA ... toward the lead female character but there is this underlying sense have to say it that\nEven as Jackson, Maine is saves temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from his young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushed the periphery\nFeminist rating problematic found\nWell but you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a feeling male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era\nWe get to a few more of your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars\nI deeply appreciative ... new wants to shyness in her early portrayal which made main characters advising her work well I'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance is scenes seemed a little too detached from me\nOverall I loved the big venue

wild\nUh you know teaching was incredible not only because it was urging everyday like everything would add to show up as adults it scream at every single there to show up in our math to my students had to be as prepared and I taught sixty nine hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lot of math or anybody who's ever anger and eleven year old\nUh what I learned there are a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into\nPieces that are can be consumed and can be repeated back so my skill was like what I deliver was not only how to like get kids to understand like when the crazy ones but like I did teach discreet skills like you know what you didn't touch it sometimes means multiplication right that like just how to take apart these big things to make them bite size and then\nHave students to be able to play with them in a way that they could put them back and re arrange on their on their own\nOr the second was like really understanding what it means to\nLike do work that will have an immediate impact but we'll have a long term impacts so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative numbers they struggle they like they can get it like anything lower than zero that like I don't get it by the year and they can fight anybody around like\nAnd like deeply understood it and that was like understanding like the arc of how to\nBuild capacity and like I learned that the third thing is I think the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got their\n... and that like I work is to help\nStudents understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone with the worse teachers do is walk in the classrooms and make people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think in such a corollary to organizing that when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community\nAnd like what I'm trying to do is help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know the amount I Believe they might not know how to use them\nAnd that's what I can do is help them find them and then use them long afterward gone\nLet's get some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct\nTV with his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people do the names of the three black women who actually started ... I think Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ...\nAnd Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nSo we think about the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that uh you know for those of us who were industry in Ferguson we are mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protests there was no one to three ten people\nWho caught us all to the street who organized everybody was so beautiful by the protesters that\nAh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember that we were the street for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend\nWhat's unfortunate is that there's this narrative that if that has come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized everybody the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true someone I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work is that I'm mindful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom\nWithout you wouldn't there would be no protests are so that it's important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exists for me that\nUh one of the important things about had in the platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president every room but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the the people who got people out of ...\nBiggest actions that people have just sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names are in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together but this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like\nWhat the catalyst for the protests there's just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certainly leaders to become more prominent\nWith the concern about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast as a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nYes it's interesting I think I'm always shut eye you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end ... a portion of all the pre order sales went to the end up ... pi legal Defense Fund that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and\nIt was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book right so like that's I think about the book specifically but in general this basic I'm mindful of ... when we started campaign zero which is like our our biggest project started in twenty Thirteen\nWe actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of non profit and we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we that was important right so we created the first I was a database of police union contracts at first it public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really discreet projects\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not a I'm a salary from the stuff so we try to do it as like\nWith just the bare necessities so that it's not just a question of like profit\nAh in with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton to be a part of it they get paid as a part of the ... I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some you know huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have\nFit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well\nAh and you know it's a guy at the way that I exist\nIn the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like a [laughter]\nNow late at night and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like it was a really rough um it was rough\nAnd only this only a couple of months ago was the first time and I'm actually lived alone since the protests I've ever since you've been saying in the basement of a like my second parents after the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not as as you know wants to get married in the in the basement of their right second parents that's not sustainable ... ... but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like\nThere are these narratives of like oh I made ... and it's like well no you see me on the news you came in a pod cast you like see me out of an event that that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case that I've had high incomes before you know that there was me income and wealth is pretty significant though I'm so people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about policing one of the members of the one eight text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and a free pass in our courts and society\nContrast that with another tax clever who wrote as time goes on society will bring about necessary reform but to denigrate and disregard the entire police force as an institution is ludicrous what do you think\n[noise]\nSupport comes from you and from capabilities farm in Dennis grower of pesticide fried vegetables offering organic and local produce artist milk cheeses and handmade gifts providing employment opportunities for people with disabilities learn more at capabilities dot org and from our business sponsors\nWhose commitment to double UCA eyes work on the Cape the coast and the islands is shown through their financial contributions\nPlease take the time to let our sponsors know that you've noticed\nAnd that you appreciate their ongoing support\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their home quote explorer tool custom quotes and rates are available online learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nFrom capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts\nWhat's in your wallet capital one NA and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nBack now to our conversation with Theresa catch in his new memoir is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope let's talk about some of the more personal aspects of your life that you describe in the book there's a short section in the book like page and a half\nWere you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write code I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remembered joy and try outs\nWhen we remember pain we are trying to protect ourselves and cope with trying to order the memories and ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote talk about how those kinds of traumatic or difficult experiences as a kid\nKind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who would gravitate toward active as\nYou know it's interesting uh this is the first time I'm saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was I hate to re read the book we should talk and I just have it I like having them with right back yet so hopefully I write back soon\nIs one of the reasons why I wrote this chapter in the ... I can remember and now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave and it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had that sort of work within an grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize has had like we're all walk into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I didn't get that has to be like a\nA core part of it uh the the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember a joy\nIs that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race or or any other after today deputy they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew what passed one would not ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know there are a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said\nOne of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraint semi constraints become so great and the way that we've learned how to\nIt didn't things beyond and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd my mother never seen the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narrative for new time the laughter always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe that you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling no story is actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you into the world\nYou also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you call the quiet quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never hidden any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love the parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote\nHow does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons I was important for me to be out very very um [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very ... way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gate to think that the only way to do this work publicly with to uh to be in the closet and\nAh you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it wasn't real frantic I was in the quiet and not the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room as a gay black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected within social justice or the work that we need to do\nWithout talking about a mile an identity that I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know um [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just stay and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed or did you say that this happened in and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally taught a couple of years later and they realize that he had actually been\nSexually abusing like a whole set of kids who\nSo like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book is that like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were ... years and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right uh so I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlook is actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my all their career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attributes where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian and gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like that's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception do you find that there's a line\nIn terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know\nLet's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my ... and they have to yeah you know like\n... I think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that there's not two ways to be gay and like\nThat's why the pride parade is really really all\nThat like yeah so like sometimes it is me wearing rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there are definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like that I don't talk about gay issues is publicly as possible and like you know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life too I live in like other people can feel like it's real re\nSo like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now they're trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people and people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of the results but that\nAre that they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns and they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cause and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like what privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I have I don't feel like I Need to talk about every two seconds for people\nPeople who can really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your ...\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bed for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling me a sellout unquote\nI Wonder how you are finding your way\nForward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so any way you are part of a media so to speak and reconciling with tons of the social justice activism word that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were\nNo ticket both hands right that like you know what's interesting is that all those people who who come in for for quote participating in the system and those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nEvery day you're learning something new and open trucks\nYou're listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations a service of W GBH Boston [noise]\nYou're listening to uh do you see a on your local news and information source for the Cape the coast and the island's Ninety point one couple of new ca I end up with the CIA I.

Johnson talking with Ralph ... experts he's the show runner of Netflix bow jak horsemen you just released its entire fifth season for streaming and I've watched just about all of that this season a rough it let's talk about season five\nRight let's get into it [laughter] getting dirty a big amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner in film it there's a light out actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I I have to say a when that line came up at the table read it got a much bigger laugh and I was expected from the crowd of people over there\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner on a press to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be unimpressed or talking about a little\nBit it's it's strange and you know one of the things we wanted to talk about we're putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the ah tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so um\nAnd it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius who you know touches the show and turned it into gold\nAnd it all just you know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um ... it's a very collaborative process\nEvery step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast springs so much the designed by at least they had all the uh director is bring so much to the episodes of the story board animators the editors um it it it really it takes a village um\nSo it's odd but yes I Am doing all these interviews now talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not how a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone\nWho represents that as how a TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word played the slapstick puns and the Pratt falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that Ron throughout the season and the show also has a memory on memory his his mistakes\nYeah it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers who we can't help but make it funny um but we really\nAre mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions you know we we take it very seriously um\nYou know but then in the middle of that\nWe we remember like All right and those guys are talking octopus or [laughter] you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here are but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals I'm so [laughter] this is quite serious\nAh but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it is is we're telling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adults as Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in television ... who do you see is your ... [laughter]\nI'm oh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show\n[laughter] no I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them to shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American ...\nI I think you know obviously the the the giants as The Simpsons and I think it would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me or my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season of Bo jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of the Simpson\nI I really wanted it to exist\nOutside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I said ah we're going to say when we start season one you're gonna watch it and the first is going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park but then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really take things seriously a in a way that people don't expect animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak any today are credible artist Carolyn the sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat\nAh and and then a lot of others to you have a Keith Olbermann in there at some yeah I'm ... one of the first people we cast [laughter]\nAnd I was cast her whale\nAs a newscaster well uh we we had in the script to um you know a a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Lynda la montage and said I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role [laughter] really and we call them like yeah sounds like fun um and he's fantastic we keep bringing it back season after season\nAnd you know what am I a first memories of making a show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had him do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some we'll noises and you\nKnow this is Keith\nOlbermann who I thought of as a very serious man are goofing around going\nYou know making whale noises and I thought this would be a fun show I think well one of your other\nMain characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison Aubrey who is phenomenal\nNow you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Alison breeze Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American this in the show now this season that's changed Diane does take a trip\nTo the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nUm we cast Alison ah in in the first season\nThird of the way into the season when we cast or we've been working a with a different actress um who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issues so she couldn't be lead on our show any more\nUm and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing uh and she's going to a a great job ever since\nUm but more and more uh as I was looking around at at the cast and and thinking about\nYou know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me\nThat everyone in our cast was white and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this was an unintentional thing uh that I was doing as a racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were casting his characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is going to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices\nOr tried to have more people of color on the show but when it comes to Dianne specifically\nUm you know I think there is a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles and I was not a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently as casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character and you know as I said in these other interviews\nUm I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness has prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it felt like this is a mistake we made\nAnd if I can just you know avoid it or you know glide passed it then you know maybe this won't become an issue where this you know won't become the thing that I ended up talking about in every interview and I I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up\nYou know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as a race didn't matter\nWe explore why they're being targeted and what's being done to protect them\nThat conversation next time on the take

member more than any other\nThe cue card holder\nNYC cue cards handles all the cue hard work in New York a decidedly low tech job but some productions refused to do without\nJoining us from NPR in New York is the owner of NYC cue cards while the fairest and he's worked three decades behind the scenes on shows including Saturday Night live while the fairest and welcome to one a\nAh thanks for having me Joshua thanks for it's great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business a while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer I majored in writing\nAnd moved to New York and the you know my brother was working at the time as a receptionist\nAnd ah they knew that you kind of guy so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible and ah ah I got the job and I you know I did it just get my foot in the door and to make riding connections\nAnd uh you know I did I did make some writing sections that I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept on doing the cue cards and I got really good at doing cue cards very quickly\nAnd ah you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I'm On my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lot of shows\nSo clearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nYou know I I don't know I think well especially on Saturday Night live the live aspect of it and being out there you know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera\nA and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows and through this hard show that they you know they'd probably a lot of them have never done lived before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure and with the changes and all the stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and uh you know everyone was a pretty quickly in the ranks\nTell us a bit about your company what shows does your company\nShows that are that are that tape all year our Saturday Night live um the Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are four main shows um and then we will do some reality shows we do a master\nWe do all the Project Runway that shoots and then we do to show any show that comes to that town that he's ... guards you know work on that\nAs well what kinds of people do well at this line of work the first thing we look for is neat printing\nNow my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school track years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of printing I as a cue cards I've seen her all written in all caps yes\nCorrect It's you know it's it's a it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about the spacing between ... between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the space in between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody off the streets okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train it for like two or three weeks I'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn um\nTwo or three weeks of training\nYeah it it 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you can't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just interviews ... these are all the rules you need to learn to memorize these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized than during whereas where how to end the card a card should end on a period or or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it flows the next car and just so many different rose where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing it\nWe're speaking to Wally ... and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York okay so let's say you're working for me for you know\nThe late night with Joshua Johnson right and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me All right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight\nLike near sighted or glasses okay so you were a glass\nAs well you were a glasses on the show where you are contacts are we're not we're either\nI don't really like contacts hourglasses\nOkay so you weren't your glasses so you can see fine I won't have to if you didn't wear glasses and you didn't want to wear contacts I could put your letters bigger\nLess words in the card and it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're taught especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to so you're gonna wear your glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we would we would have hearses ride would practice with you if you've never read two cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away because that'll that'll look like you're reading the cue cards\n... how do you mean it looked as rapidly as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your bad leader\nAnd I had two cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play to those cue cards now if you were looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the card in the bed later the audience would be like oh he's ... obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those cue cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the cameras so yeah so I'll I we open depending on where you are in position to the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right size so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nShow your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction the the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right especially with Saturday Night live that's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day as block sketches and I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put\nThe cars and I work with the director of the stage managers wild well kind of can for and I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they need an extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical workweek at SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously unfilled eleven thirty five PM\nWish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday we start rehearsals on Thursday and Thursdays a light day\nSo the music the musical group ... for the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only played one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more\nAnd it it'll change from Thursday sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night\nBe written from Thursday to friday and then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process reprint put that on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it ... the cards so it makes sense and then we when we do that we don't have the without the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the friday sketches because senators show day\nSo everything's print that I have about eight people there on friday just yeah basically writing all day I have the fun job I'm Out on the set blocking working with the actress having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock so sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you lower you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or do you have like veteran cue card writers working for the there is a little\nBit of both um mostly um\nPeople that are trying to get a footnote I encouraged that I I Try to tell them cue cards is not a career I I did make it a career for myself but there's not much room if you want to do it great for your lives that's awesome but you should be looking to do something else I'm encouraging them I'm helping them I'm introduced them that people that want the", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year":
