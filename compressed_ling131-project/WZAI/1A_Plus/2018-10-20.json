A. M. U. dot org\nLet's keep going with this investigation into the disappearance possible murder of ... Catherine wrote on our Facebook page putting denies Russia had anything to do with the poisoning of the former military officer and his daughter\nSaudi prince denies any involvement in murder of journalists who criticized him Trump goes along with both anyone else worried about the u._s. abandoning our moral authority\nSonia wrote on our Facebook page here's what I don't understand a Saudi national was grabbing the Saudi embassy in Istanbul it's been determined that ... was murdered based on recordings heard by no one but some Turkish government officials who want to remain anonymous\nTurkey has not released the recordings but there have been leaks of what's in Turkey's government is not above repression and this kind of nefarious behavior\nAre we supposed to do as an uninvolved third party\nBefore I let you respond to that ... tweeted and uninterested third party hardly ... was a legal permanent us resident with children who are us citizens the usa isn't interested party even if Trump is not interested in the euro would you respond to that [noise]\nYeah absolutely I think it's right that were not an uninvolved third party this man was a resident he was not only that he was a columnist for a prominent American newspaper the Washington Post and let's be honest that a lot of the reason this has gotten so much attention in this country is because the post has rightly put a huge and hot spotlight on it and\nNot let anyone forget about it and you know other newspapers in the United states and world media have picked up on it too and really kept the attention on it I was struck\nBy President Trump saying yesterday when he finally acknowledge that yes it appears this man was murdered that he said this story has captured the world's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it it is the job of the media\nTo demand accountability to seek truth and our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world\nPart of that is about moral values and when we have a very close ally\nWho by the way our military hardware is used in that Saudi campaign in Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians and children and is now leading to a huge famine in Yemen how can we say that weren't uninvolved party\nUm you know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies and it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who was alleged to have done something like this we have certain forms of leverage that include arms sales and include potential sanctions right and many other things\nI Will say though I dreams I Do kind of feel worse Sonja is coming from in a way because and we've talked about this on this program before the U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship\nBut we've never tried to exert strong moral or ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that one is an entangled but I kind of take Sonia point like the U.S\nDoesn't really want to have to spank Saudi Arabia over its actions because there is a tremendous military and economic entanglements so I'm not really sure what the us has the\nAuthority to do it well this is the let me ... me amplify that point Josh represents absolutely critical you know ... someone who's been actually very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point in them of paraphrasing here\nThat all the money in the world and all the military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalists for their opinions that's an international norm is a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's like a critical one\nI mean the show was called ... for the first amendment with that is in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world and if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a Senator Rubio said will never be able to buy our credibility back on these issues\nSenator Lindsey Graham made a very similar point he was so angry and he said I've been a huge ally as NPs and Saudi Arabia but I'm never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan issue\nThan have it is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published what is believed to be ... final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and Arabic and he writes about the systemic the systematic dismantling of the free press in much of the Arab world here's one\nBrief quote from that column quote these actions no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media\nAt an increasing rate unquote\nHave what do you think is he right\nI think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region\nIs that oftentimes strategic interests have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues under the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but if not indeed we never halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOr despite the ongoing campaign in Yemen we'd never a threatened to sanction them over a they're a you over their funding of jihad his and other extremists in Syria we never have really taken very strong action against Saudi Arabia or any\nAny country or any country in the region for their actions except for Iran who has been fundamentally aligned against the Gulf ... a Gulf states\nWith the sentiment in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nBefore it it's I Hope that we have the fortitude to actually the people in ... that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually pass some sort of legislation that or does something if the Trump Administration does not but it seems unlikely given the history of the issue\nSo basically the people who killed ... may get away with this then you may never really know who killed him there may never be any real prosecution because of just the cold hard fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis is a business relationship\nAnd you you've totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been wrote killers who took out to show G and reporting earlier this week that said that the U.S is actively working with the Saudi Government to try and come up with some sort of feasible solution that admits the death of show gee but does not blame Mohammed bin Salman\nA coach or Africa not coming out of that because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to to Saudi Arabia was to say that look\nUm you have to get out in front of this this is that you cannot speak to some of the rug I'm absolutely convinced we are going to get to the bottom of this because there's just so much evidence with the Turks now have\nThey have the photograph these Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve of which are part of\nOf the ... the crown princes security detail or intelligence services\nI think we're going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a fall guy but somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that maybe they're going to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral Ahmed Asiri as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to you know offer up a a senior scapegoat\nBut I'm I'm pretty convince we're going to figure out what happened here\nWhat we will keep an eye on the story we're glad to get some more of your comments on this for now let's move on to some of the other big stories that make news this weekend may have flown under your radar because of all the attention about Jamal his show gee rightly given of course but there's also an update from Afghanistan where the war\n[noise] [noise]

NPR station\nBack now to the friday news roundup with James kid field of the center for the study of the presidency in Congress in the ... one of the Boston Globe and the Pulitzer center and have brown of buzzfeed do still a little more time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from around the world one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThis week some Americans were probably green with envy and our neighbors to the north\nRight about now\nI got\nThat out\nThey were celebrating in Montreal this week because on Wednesday Canada legalize recreational marijuana\nNationwide it's only the second country in the world to do so why was the first in twenty Thirteen Andrew tweeted Canada legalizing we'd was like California legalizing we'd both for like a long relationship where you've been dating forever but just now means official\nHays how big a deal is this and do you think this is the start of a Global Trends something that has just kind of been understood for a long time and just hasn't been made official\nYet you know that's a great question because I'm not really sure I mean I think that when you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal\nThan at or do you compare that to things like the un officer drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that it you know marijuana is this evil so it's really tough to tell like where the global feeling is on wheat legalization\nIf um you weren't you bring it up say at a meeting in the European Union's\nOf European Parliament then I'm guessing you still would not have merely a majority of people in favor to even in a place like the USO ... Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana which he did is doing now compared to you know it being a private business\nOr that private but illegal business among many small dealers\nThe whole drug trade it and whether uh there's going to be any sort of shift in you know I'm sure that can is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether it causes a surgeon traffic accidents where their claws asserted tops realization or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada\nYeah the CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't driving stone is of course worth noting\nThat in this country marijuana is considered the most illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there\nWith heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use and the high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd ... who was an official with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint had smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all empty the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's Todd oh one of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication\nWhen you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was this updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things packed them on to NAFTA and set it snapped a to point no but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know this people are saying that essentially this is a potential marijuana mess right now I'm so I think this could be an issue because we certainly do not have legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis\nI Wonder also dreams what other kinds of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean\nJustin Trudeau now has to kind of owned is whether it's seen as a good move or a negative move there remains the question as to what legalization of the national level mind me for Canada on top of that there are early reports that suggested supplies are running low because candidates takes time to cultivate the point of being\nAnd things are running out supplies running out I Wonder what kinds of additional unintended consequences we might keep an eye out for a\nWhile you know the Canadian Medical Association journal called this a an uncontrolled experiment so we're going to we're going to find out a lot of things about this but I must admit that I'm not\nThat surprised when you can walk into the major states the United states like Colorado or California and mirrors dispensaries for recreational marijuana everywhere I I think this is a trend that's happening\nUh all over the United states and it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna keep going because people are going to realize that there's a lot of money to been made when you tax marijuana\nA and they use has happened in any way and putting these people in jail is probably not the best use of public funds so I I see is part of the continuum I think it was kind of inevitable that are progressive neighbors to the north for probably going to get a jump on this on this\nBut um you know I just been struck by going around the country and see in states where this is already happening and everyone kind of shrugs is not a big deal\nYeah this doesn't seem James to have the kind of energy I mean it's not like to fly to love against prohibition you know where it was considered this major like its issue about liberty and of course it helped spur of the rise of organized crime if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this feels very much like something that was just\nKind of a matter of time like yet they legalize it was going to happen sooner or later\nThat's my sense too yeah that is the trend is pretty clear in this country and and Canada Cain has had medical marijuana since two thousand and one it's very popular so too does not out on a limb by endorsing the so I I think it's a it's kind of inevitable\nYeah not one of the loudest most aggressive social movements with regards to the legalization of cannabis a much more impactful movement that has reverberated around the world is the me too movement and we should talk about that before our time is up this week MJ Akbar who's the minister of state for external affairs in India\nLeft that post after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual assault\nAnd harassment also in India this week there were protests and violence meant by that but any woman trying to enter the ... temple in ... state in India groups of conservative Hindu men threw stones and attacked women and journalist who tried to get to clubs let's start\nWith this story involving energy Akbar Hays how have we seen the me too movement play out in India or is this just kind of the beginning of its effect on men in power\nI think so it's it's interesting because the me too movement really kicked off here in the United states a year ago and\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nOr in recent weeks it has finally like grabbed the country and shaking it\nUh we Steve is all started with one actress a one Bollywood actress coming forward and just it's been a tidal wave of accusations since then women taking to Twitter and being unafraid to name their alleged abuse abusers and assault or by name\nAnd just being really willing to step out and do what the Indian courts haven't done before which is try to bring these men into account\nAnd um it's it's really interesting that ... one of the first to go considering um he had such a long run in the Indian journalism teen ... and\nUh the most of the women who came forward about him were fellow journalists were fellow reporters so I feel like that is a bit of credence to these allegations and we'll see whether in the future they are the the women who are I guess lower down on into full status will finally start to be believed as well\nWith regards to the protests of the ... temple in terrible estate the BBC's dreams cleats in was they're asking people why they were protesting here's what one man said\nNo no no no no no no no
