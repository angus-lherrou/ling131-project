A. M. U. dot org let's get back to that story of the Saudi Arabian journalist ... who has gone missing possibly murdered\n... we've heard a number of accounts particularly from the Turks about what Saudi Arabia allegedly did to Mr to show you that they basically said hitman after him what do we know for sure about the disappearance at this point\nFor shall we know that he walked into the come so uh in ... and he didn't work out\nThat is what we know for sure that all the reports that there were two gulfstream jets that came from Saudi Arabia or with fifty men of new they go into a blackout a fans are drove to the ... so the ...\nHe ... he may have been taken and they did what they did to him now there are reports that collecting that attack ... intelligence have proof\nOr that or that they know what happened to him and that he was tortured and dismembered\nAnd I met the most brutal brutal debts under the fifty men then flew back to a Saudi Arabia on the Gulf Stream jets a little later in the day now we know that the the planes that were those to play movements at different times that came into his stumble ... and then went back to Riyadh\nWho was on them what they designation was within the state capital racist widowed one hundred percent no but you get the distinct sense that uh the ... the Turkish attending the authorities here\n... you will thirties here in the U.S understand he's not a million miles from what I have just sketched out because I think that there has been a willingness to believe and that is why you're seeing\nThe deep expressions of anxiety and on these over what his unfolded and what the implications might be there's some things that you can easily sweep under the carpet in international affairs on there are some things that are just there are a bit more ... could ... definitely falls into the latter category\nWhere we I Wonder if we can talk about the U.S in Saudi Arabia is relationship to really long time allies any press conference at the oval office yesterday President Trump was asked about to show these disappearance here's part of what the president's at\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and we're lucky again this took place in Turkey\nAnd to the best of our knowledge\nIs not a United States citizen is that right or for a permanent resident okay we're all like John would all like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have four\nOr five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people think\nThe president speaking at the oval office yesterday and when we use referring too vague human Saudi Arabia and the four or five alternatives would be other countries from home the Saudis could buy arms to hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms deal a military deal between the U.S\nAnd Saudi Arabia ... I Wonder if you could give us a sense of how this case\nFits into the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia especially in light of the comment that I\nForty three wrote on our website the one eight dot org [noise]\nThere was no reason to maintain close ties with the country that heads more people than ISIS finally gives women the right to drive but it's only window dressing is killing civilians in Yemen and murdered a journalist who was critical of quote unquote royal\nFamily if I were king for a day all the weapons we've sold them would be rendered useless and Jared pushed or would be banned from any policy making\nLove the sharp elbows thrown in that comment I Wonder if you could help us fact\nChecked that yeah I think um it's it's really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold lead transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we have billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I I'm so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually than up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy\nAnd that attitude had activated a lot of\nUm people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle Chris Murphy and Rand Paul who have an argument for a long time just as the commentator said\nI'm now we're supporting the war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians in you know bus attacks and other things that are just horrendous um why\nYou know how to cut you short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to a reporter this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nI think that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval so no I think that uh unless the unless hell of a sudden the journalists turns up alive\nI think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise] plus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead\nI was gonna say people like Rand Paul are going to push back against arms sales about about our support for the war in Yemen um even saw a at a law makers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that it out of the U. S. Trump Administration has to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I Want it there is a counterpoint to this deal which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of set the quiet part out loud a little bit in the way he in a way he framed it yesterday because we have never had a relationship\nIt's all been about money and oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia\nThat then lead to a permanent rupture and our alliance because we've always seen them as a strategic ally not as a values faith ally as in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump Senate and particularly accentuated way and he feels you know is very transactional went past presidents have\nBut this is somewhat reflective of what us up presidents have said quietly for a long time\nYou just referred to chip in the Nazis out here I mean I think Donald Trump said out loud what other presidents and other prime ministers have said it could moments in relationships you have with regimes that are far from perfect I mean I remember when Tony Blair was prime minister\nAnd there was a huge I'm Still it was about to be concluded\nAnd the British serious fruit office launched an investigation into Saudi Arabia or had been doing and whether they'd be paying kickbacks or whatever to get contracts through\nI'm ... and you know it was clear that Saudis who said to Blair you've got to call this the core off the dos otherwise the deal is in jeopardy and highly unusually mercifully controversial Leigh Tony Blair intervened with a ... an independent investigation and said right we're canceling this investigation\nAnd he used his power as prime minister because he felt he had to because Saudi Arabia was to bigger customer too important to not alive\nAnd you've seen with Donald Trump you know one of the first places he went to when he became president was to Saudi Arabia I traveled with him on that trip\nAnd it was they were one hundred percent in with Mohammed bin summer now whether they're regrets email note is an open question however they they are there and they and Donald Trump has determined that the arms deal will go ahead [noise]\nJust before we keep ... oh go ahead and oh I was just\nGoing to say if I could just add one thing that struck me as what the president didn't say he didn't mention Iran and he didn't mention the piece done as you recall last month at the un\nAnd the United states has pretty aggressive in calling around the biggest threat to the region and by extension it was seen Saudi Arabia that stopgap against possible Iranian expansion across the middle east\nUm and of course on Saudi Arabia would be key to any sort of he still so I think it's interesting that I'm a month ago we were talking about\n[noise]\n\n\nYour son and from bona with\nThe bone a certified craftsman program a network of hardwood flooring contractor is committed to expertise and customer service contract to locate her and more information or at bona dot com\nFrom capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet capital one in a\n[noise] and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nBack now to the front of news round up with John ... uses and Henri Friedman still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the week's top stories as well one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThe story of the president of Interpol Ming hung way was reported missing last week by his wife that stories moved Maine was detained by Chinese authorities on corruption charges\nHe resigned in immediate effect this week the arrest as part of a larger official anti corruption campaign by China's president Xi Jinping\nKnow grace Ming the ex Interpol president's wife is speaking out she told the Associated Press that she felt threatened nephews have do we have a sense that\nYou know of why this is going on and what it is that makes me so important to the Chinese government of what this means that a larger sense well\nHe's been a long time operative of the the Chinese government and their arguments being made that this is part of an effort to purge non loyalists to the she government and so there is no definitive answer but\nI think the message that um many are taken as if somebody who's been in government this long and the police capacity\nUm could be sweat swept off the streets and his wife sent a knife a ... the day the day he disappears at knowing in China's safe and and at the time of all this there was talk from party officials about the importance of absolute loyalty said they're suggestion certainly is that somehow\nHe was less than ... in the eyes of the government\nI Will say I think I'm One of the more interesting developments as well as his wife and how outspoken she has been she has been she's in French protective custody\nBut she's been speaking out in a way that we wouldn't normally see out of China and I thought it was an interesting development and may have led to more information coming out quicker than Chinese officials wanted to happen\nAnd so it was fascinating to watch her sort of use um the public platform in a way we see more often in the west as a way to get information about her husband and defend her husband that's something we don't normally is\nTo Brazil were far right presidential candidate John ... surprised the nation when he shot to the top of the rings he nearly took the election was forty six percent of the vote just shy of preventing a runoff Brazilians will vote in the runoff election soon on October twenty eighth\nWhere we Freidman can you remind us who joy ... is and what makes him and his policy platform so newsworthy\nYeah he's a fascinating character he's been he's a former army captain has been in a Congress for almost three decades\nUm he's a law and order candidate that his his big thing so he says you know our crime rates are too high we need to empower the police he is very controversial and saying you know the police need to shoot first um and and um shoot to kill 'em and and also to losing gun laws to address crime rates he's\nAlso very controversial in the sense that he said things that are most optimistic\nUm that are anti algae it'd be the um and one other thing that's really important in Brazil we often forget I'm only became a democracy in Nineteen eighty five or return to democracy in Nineteen eighty five for Twenty one years ahead of dictatorship and he has spoken ...\nUm about the time of the dictatorship as a time when there was a law and order one other point to know is that he had an armored but Donald Trump a lot of conservatives feel that Donald Trump has the right formula be pro business you know loosen regulations a you know be nationalistic\nAnd be about cracking down on crime and he has promised me a really close ally of the United states all of this is\nI'm very a shocking because Brazil for many ... for decades has been led by a leftist government uh there was a little more ambivalent about its relationship with the United states and certainly a didn't espouse come to the right wing view is\nThat he espoused so this is a real shock to the system I think it really goes to the fact\nThat Brazil I mean it's in deep recession it's embroiled in a massive corruption\nUm crisis or that affected all parties except for both an arrow who is actually not been implicated in this and that was his\nThat was his winning point I'll say one other thing we you know the Atlantic wrote an article in which they interviewed a a cab driver who said you know things are so bad maybe we need someone with crazy ideas out who else is going to fix this math and so I think that that is that is the sentiment that is worth keeping an eye on because that was a similar sentiment\nIn ... and Donald Trump's victory in the victory of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to Mexico I mean this is a sentiment that people are feeling against the establishment in many countries of the world\nBut to hear from some Brazilians who are listening and today and looking ahead to the election one listener emailed I'm and I'm a Brazilian listening from me sitting next to Brazil's capital Brasilia I'm very\nThe candidate leading the polls is an ex military who has a very anti democratic discourse which is also racist massage and his and homophobic since last Sunday the election day more than fifty people have suffered physical and verbal aggressions from both so NATO supporters social media specifically what's app\nIs playing a very important role and lots of fake news is circulating I really believe that with both an auto our democracy is at risk John ... what's projected to happen for the runoff is there any sense of whether ... could win this\nFor the last poll I saw suggested yes that that the latest post suggests that he is at fifty eight percent\nOn the opposition leader is at forty two percent or ... for them to that and so I kind of thing that you'd have to say that it's it would that sort of managing that risk and it takes some quite something for the left is kind of candidate to come back from that position\nUm I mean you know they took it up on us and the other thing about both ... he was stabbed in September as a rally\nI'm so there's been a lot of violence around but his men that he's been able to say\nI really love to take part in debates I really count at the moment because I'm Still you know slightly getting out of the stopping that I had things that I'm afraid I might be able to come to your studio this evening and so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is he's got his head down he has said what he said people know exactly where he stands and I think he sees the finish line\nOne story that much of the world has been talking about has to do with a new report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the PCC\nThe report says that the world is quickly running out of time to stem catastrophic climate change scientists predict we're on course to go beyond a crucial threshold of the world's average temperature rising one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nIn just over about ten years they saved that would leave us dealing with the risks of extreme drought wildfires floods food shortages for hundreds of millions of people we talked about this report\nOn the program this week one comment from a listener stuck along the lines that at least here in America this is just not a big enough issue I mean people vote for a lot of reasons and the state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about\nOr that voters demand to discuss Nancy use if what is your sense of that of whether or not this report\nHas made an impact around the world enough for people to start demanding\nAction I think it's made an impact but the problem is the effect said that's already being seen in various ways around the world so where one country can\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\n... demand sort of a uniform world agreed upon action and we're not there yet and so I'm ... years scene of variance in response and I think it really reflects the variants of impact that nations are already seen\nAnd you know as a as a war correspondent and one of the things I see it come up most often as as a cause of the start of\nWars and conflicts environmental changes changing where people live how they're able to eat so I'm ... ... it's an area that doesn't just hit the environment that really hits other parts of of national security and government writ large but there's because of the complexity in terms of its impact\nI think it's hard to get a uniform agreement particularly at it in such a polarized time um so it's hard to be optimistic that that will see at least in the short term the kinds of drastic changes at this report says needs to happen to stop literally famine drought wildfires really severe consequences\nStructure I was in Europe at the beginning of the week and when the report came out and on the main national news shows a half an hour long so the same as the nightly news programs here the the first six seven minutes would devote to to decide
