getting the facts on this program and we'd like to get you some of the facts about really facts yeah if you care about facts\nIt seems to me and I'm cornered market we figure will do it\nAnd we don't go for it you know and if you'd like to get some of the facts about space and science for astrophysics and its relationship to the military now is a good time comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. H. M. U. dot ... let me start with the book this alliance between astrophysics and\nMilitary give us a sense of what that is in a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggests\nYeah so so we already are familiar with the role that other scientists have played in warfare especially engineering you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that was first showed up on the battlefield was at a symmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where\nYour opponent has something that you don't have and you're in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call that an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the notebook have\nOf Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a master mind that sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of its scientist engineer and an artist but moving forward you think of the physicist as a person who builds the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know that can is that you know wouldn't make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas\nAt the biologist might weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association because we just humbly sit at mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy\nAnd then we carefully take the detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw so that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics in the military it just never shows up\nBut in fact astrophysicist and then the earlier days of ... have been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations\nUm in particular the the need to navigate with precision\nAround the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nAnd to to know the night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky looks different depending on where you are on earth and things rise of different times and sat in different places\nAnd so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control over\nI should know we didn't have the conversation on this program for those who are more interested in this connection between science and the military about the ...\nOr one a good bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which produces one and you can find that conversation on line at the one eight dot board new President Trump announced the creation of a space for the summer a six the branch of the military to focus on the militarization\nOf space so I guess it will be a fifth Brandt since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of what happened within there is a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have accomplish avoid to be in the best interest of the American people and humanity\nSo first of all just to to the space force is not a new concept and it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the u._s. aerospace industry which at the time\nWas had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs those consolidation in the industry there's competition from Europe with Airbus\nAnd other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets so there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry\nTo what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon it's on your step to the next morning some airplane delivered it they're\nRight or at least in the near the airport [laughter]\n... doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but\nWe would call them drones I guess but so so you you ... when you\nLook at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well\nMight we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns or space because these are the same companies\nAerospace companies that that became a word right and if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general and the air force then and now controls space activities of the military is called the U.S air force space command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space where it's separate from what's already happening so I wasn't going to second guess the general but I was\nWhen you contributed WC AI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support doubling UCI at Cape and islands data word\nSounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak that was very we don't want to just be there we want to we don't wanna just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will just mean\nDo you think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has you know supremacy Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than say the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have ... said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really referencing rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force\nAnd slide them out under one umbrella once with a coherent umbrella and if you're going to do that\nUh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it\nUh that could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroid strikes and then the limit it could render is all extinct\nAs one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all species of life on earth at the time that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that as a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate

today the God of space flight center do you have any suggestions on how I can slam dunk this thing it's my dream to be able to work at NASA\n[laughter] [noise] I think in this kind of in the world of of\nUh exploring the frontier or\nNot only a strong resume matters but uh inter personally enthusiasm ... I think really matters they want to know that you you really care and you're ... you're in it and your\n... your your spirit energy that is spilling out of you that all your whole body mind and soul is ready to be given onto this grand adventure that we're all part taking him and the exploration of space so I think if you convey that uh I don't know if it's a slam dunk\nBut at least it's a um\nIt's a shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay in basketball analogy\nTweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain into a machine chassis I eat a robot body or transplanting a human consciousness into a ...\nFirst the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions as also we do some very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing\nTo put a human brain into a robotic chassis um when you could program the robotic chassis to have almost anything you really care about I don't see that as as as a thing that people will do and the other option was what to put put to put our consciousness I live in LA\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is\nAn evidence of that is how many books are still written on it there's evidence that usually you don't know\nWhat it is for example if you look on the shelf of books on gravity is like three books we got gravity [laughter] we're not still writing books on its alone\nAt just the law yeah idea obey gravity so um but it is sort of uploading all of your electro chemical impulses into some machine to mimic that\nTo mirror that maybe that comes along with consciousness we don't know but I see that happening long before we would take a brain and stick it in a in a machine by the way speaking of transplanting brain what I really want\nIs if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure a O. S.\nAt least find a way to transplant the brain of an average patient into the body of I'm\nSorry the brain of an ale less patient into the body of an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body other you lose your your mind\nThat this sounds very altered carbon even lost a lot of Netflix sandwich [laughter] very Frankenstein too is really what I just ... if you had\nGoals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find cures for both of those before we learn how to transplant of brain but I think about that all the time\nCertainly helps them certainly hope so and wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is that there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and your scoop out some water and the ... of water really carefully insect\nThere no whales in the ocean [laughter]\nBut you haven't looked so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy in our search for\nLife are intelligent life uh for example uh um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard out or Mars and perhaps other places but a ... anyone who's studied the problem is in no way doubts the straw\nWe're in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\n[noise] Amy asked on our Facebook page will the human race ceased to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends not considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\n[noise] we're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because\nThe more dangerous than asteroid is the bigger it is typically and the bigger it as the easier it is to detect so so uh I I think we're good about that it's possible that a comic could come\nFrom out of nowhere because comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out\nOr it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but in I regardless you want a healthy space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding you know protecting having insurance plan that you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating thing that it would be very rare so but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds\nOf our power\nAnd over nature and heed the warnings are scientists\nI Wonder how what what do your over under is on that I tend to be fairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp\nOf the value of the earth that this is the one home we have than many of their parents and and forebears and I kind of you know today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces but what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful I'm realistically hopeful so but I'm I'm I'm ... I'm\nI'm cynically hopeful so here's how this cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they act\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right the woman ever get to that point\nThis so this ... you know because we reach it or or or soil in green no because you reach a point where people say no this is to this is this I cannot tolerate any further on an e people\nI don't want to eight people so that the grid is too hot [laughter] right right do you so you so we have restoring forces in the world\nThat prevent swing too low in in this regard and ...\nOh it's a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I've ... I've seen people bounce back\nSocieties bounce back ... people in power bounce back so how long you're going to deny science until it really interferes with your health and your wealth and he said oh my gosh I think I like science again and then you put the funds back in and so that's why I think we'll be okay\nJared so many questions through our app won a vox pop\nYou think that human beings are physically incapable of understanding the fundamental nature of the universe if not what the timeline to solving say something like\nDark matter the question Jared ... so I think about that all the time I lose sleep on whether I was slightly rephrase the question I lose sleep over whether the human mind is smart enough\nTo act to truly understand the universe as it is\nAnd I worry that we may not be smart enough to even who what question to ask\nAnd this disturbs me because we know who defines humans as intelligent we do we do yeah who's to say that that is sufficient intelligence to figure out how the universe works\nAnd the W.

U. dot org we've been hearing from so many of you Elizabeth tweets why is the minimum wage a specific amount instead of a percentage tied to cost of living or some other figure measured\nAnd adjusted annually and we'll emails us from Cape Cod I have a small landscaping in gardening business with depending on the time of year\nSix to ten employees all skilled gardeners I pay at least Eighteen dollars an hour and I support a higher minimum wage we're going to be talking about minimum wage and a living wage let's have Paul ... on a set the table force a little bit Paul the federal minimum wage\nIs just seven twenty five less than half of what Amazon is paying and what you can make in California starting in twenty twenty two hasn't been raised by Congress since two thousand and nine and its last ten percent of its purchasing power or even since two thousand nine how many states huge to the seven twenty five\nFederal minimum ... there are about Twenty one states where the uh minimum wage is just seven twenty five um and then there's another group of about eight states where it's boom wages is a little higher but still low or nine dollars are lower\nUh the other ... you know there's other Twenty one states have um a you know stopped waiting for Congress to act and have have raised the minimum wage including a whole cluster of them that are raising it significantly to the twelve to Fifteen dollar an hour range\nWhen did the the the key things on the minimum wage to understand is you know it's a it's been ... because of of the role of money in politics and you know the congressional Republican leaderships refusal to um to to to allow any action on it um it's really become irrelevant to the federal level it's so low it's not doing its job to rate of raising pay\nAnd this is a real issue right now you know to get receiving increasing attention um you know we're in a booming economy jobs are growing but there's almost no wage growth jobs are barely keeping up with rice the rising cost of living\nThe one place where we're seeing wage growth for workers at the bottom are in those states that are raising the minimum wage and that\nThat actually speaks to the point the important point that Mr ... and the caller raised about hey you know if some companies are raising pay may do we need a minimum wage\nBut the the data shows that while there are some leaders to really raise the floor and improve improve improve pay in our economy we need we need fair standards and the minimum wage has to be a lot higher and\nThe um you know things have gotten so out of whack that today close to one and three Americans\nAre earns less than Fifteen dollars an hour that some you know forty million workers the median age of thirty is thirty five you know these are overwhelmingly adults who spend their careers in these jobs and it's you know it's it's not it's fast food but not just fast food it's jobs you know the jobs to make our economy run about\nYou know one one for health care workers one in five educators you know huge swaths of our economy of our workforce are stuck in these jobs paying less than Fifteen dollars an hour\nAnd ... I I think it says a lot when you say that the minimum wages as lay down by Congress has almost irrelevant to the real economy because seven dollars and twenty five cents\nJust doesn't go anywhere in most states in most localities are and yet to have Congress advocating laws that are essentially irrelevant to how people really live\nA is a remarkable in ... and notable state of affairs necessary you're a proponent of a living wage and I and I read that tweet from one of our listeners he said why have a minimum wage why not index it essentially to a real life now what is the difference between a minimum wage and and what's become known as a living wage\nWell MIT has a living wage calculator where you can go on there and I typed in where you live\nSo I'm looking at the cost of local transportation sued housing and other basic needs I looked up on the city I live in the district of Columbia they said uh the living wage there I was Seventeen dollars an hour but that's for a full time work\nAnd I want to point out that a huge ... additional problem in addition to the low wages in this country is the increase in security if work how many people are working part time at Walmart it's half\nOf their employees are part time workers and then there's the temporary workers and the subcontracted workers you know Amazon Fifteen dollars an hour is not going to apply to their\nA contractor says the increase per ... precarious ness of work that that's also a big problem eat despite are low unemployment we still have so many people working every day for poverty wages\nI'm Paul even though Fifteen dollars an hour is twice the current federal minimum as you mentioned we're it from a lot of listeners who say in this economic climate or even Fifteen doesn't go very far let's hear from some of them\nWhen all is higher than the minimum wage to try to better for workers but whenever I catch up on a one way of writing a minimum wage that's never\nAnd as a college graduate with a bachelor's degree and student loans I already make Fifteen dollars an hour at\nA fulltime job and have to supplement with at least one part time job at all times\nI think there needs to be some consideration on regional differences because I can assure you that Fifteen dollars an hour in South Carolina goes much further than Fifteen dollars an hour in California\nI work another job effect my full time job and uh so I Am kind of like we can buy unfortunately a lot of credit card debt and the result and actually like Eighteen dollars an hour to twenty four a fulltime job would probably be closer to say Bye bye\nPaul we hear from a lot of listeners there who were living on a minimum wage and for many many more this has been a big issue in Congress a workers who work for big companies can't afford healthcare don't have insurance wind up relying on state or federal public assistance\nTo make up the difference and that suggests that all of us in some way are subsidizing low wages you know you're you're exactly right and ... and those are your callers I mean actually if you look at cost of living data you see that in all fifty states uh\nFifteen dollars an hour to cover the basics and just a couple of years and in the high cost states the your your your listeners were flogging or workers with children will need even more than Fifteen dollars an hour we have a report on our website by my uh pinto P. I. N. T. O. on this with the with the numbers for all fifty states and uh\nIt really highlights how Fifteen is really a basic national floor and we need to even go up from there\nLike a you know you know in New York and New Jersey did this week we're airport workers are getting a raise to Nineteen dollars an hour\nIn hotel workers are are striking around the country in the higher costs cities demanding twenty five dollars an hour or so you know your workers or your your listeners are right about about about what you know as a practical matter if you do the math what would it ... individuals need to to to get by especially in the higher cost regions\nAnd as a result you know a lot of ... of of companies big and small are relying on our taxpayer funded safety net for support you know more than a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year of safety net programs go to a workers in low paying jobs and you know these are good programs and we should have them but we need\nYou know major employers to do their part to pay a decent wage of at least Fifteen dollars an hour and then to supplement that with a with work supports in order to help bring bring workers up to a a a basic level now let's hear some of the\nOther side of the ... rights to us on Facebook when I worked for Walmart we were all excited when they raised our wages to ten dollars and fifty cents but then they cut ours to barely twenty hours a week then told us if we even had to have an open schedule we would get even less I'm skeptical of individual companies\nThat are raising wages and we received also a lot of calls from people who were concerned that raising the federal minimum wage to say Fifteen dollars an hour could wind up backfiring on workers\nI'm all for making you know Fifteen dollars an hour at the job I'm at now I work at ... or ... in the mall but I find that a lot of people\nKeep your favorite local station coming in strong and clear wherever you are [noise]\nSupport comes from you and from the

Want to talk about a fight going on in Washington DC where we happen to be you know one of the studios of WAMC you enter the world [laughter] unfortunately increasingly so but there has been\nA very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington is a world knows it but D.C as locals know it uh there was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage for shift workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grassroots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others um voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting\nThis very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue or what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for ... workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the rest in in ones and hopefully five ...\nThe way I see it this week the living wage movement to three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back with the DC Council voted to repeal um that the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers\nI'm sad really than minimum wage for tipped workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for a couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents\nTechnically if you don't make enough tips to um bring that ah wage up to that the um the local minimum your employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color or ... it\nShe'll harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really a A N E L a wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system\nUm the industry launched an incredible campaign against it they put posters up everywhere in the city saying save our tips to try to make people think that this had something to do with banning tips\nIt did not it was clearly be beyond a local issue this was a national showdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this vulnerable sector of the workforce\nA Michael Saltsman what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this uh the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters is is remarkable but what about the economics of it well actually so\nI I think in this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it went until three twenty in the morning I'm In the number of employees who showed up to say\nThis is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far outnumbered those where they're supportive and I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage in in DC is is is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employees in D.C\nAccording to the bureau of Labor Statistics are in with their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are\nAlready doing quite well in what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the tips made when am wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employees who said\nWe want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group of New York based group called rock that didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money that come in to try and put this issue\nOn the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring from employees hundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees that you say you say grass roots and I'm I'm sure that you're right but grass roots are astro turf we see so much grass roots in the area of wages and minimum wage is only to find out that the grassroots workers\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support WBAI at Cape and islands dot org word\nUm because the the testimony they gave it you know one forty five in the morning or the people who got up or at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be harmful to me this is going to be harmful to my industry\nDon't try and save me I'm not asking for it I mean I think that the the the the notion I think that these people are just doing that um because they're sort of put up to it somehow that they're not real employees\nUm I I think it's kind of insulting to what they're trying to do and Phil Mendelson chairman Phil Mendelson the chair of the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got us to talk about this which is that he said\nI have heard from countless employees who tell me this is not good for them\nI have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep it and he said people can come to meet privately they can email me this is not an issue of their owners being intimidated he said that the grassroots on this in support of it was silent he called them the silent grassroots and I think that's that's indicative of where the passion was on this issue let's pull back\nFrom the district the district of Columbia the local D.C back out to the nation at large and so many of you won a listeners\nHad been reaching out to us Nina posts on Facebook I'm In a precarious position if my wages go up I won't be eligible for Medicaid so it's a wash or worst for me we talked about free riders and how many workers who get minimum wages wind up on public assistance\nAnd Randy in Tulsa emails advocates a correct Amazon Wal Mart McDonalds and the other giants can afford Fifteen dollars for a minimum wage but the local donut shop the mom and pop floors those businesses will be hurt it's just another blow against main street\nNow Sara I Want to talk to you about income inequality and wear a minimum wage fits into this we hear so much about the growing wealth gap in massive income inequality in this country we talk about the shrinking of the middle class but at the low end of the pay scale ... increases in minimum wage actually provide\nAny real equity or is it just a drop in the bucket in a world where the top one percent on fifty percent\nMeaningful that in some ways it as a drop in the bucket you know a couple of years that go to my colleagues calculated that three men three wealthiest men in America including Amazon's the email address basis Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have combined wealth at is greater than the combined wealth at the bottom half of the country\nAnd today that's an understatement because just face as well as increased\nDramatize is just how extreme the wealth gap is and I think there's a lot of interest in\n'em adding to the fight for Fifteen efforts to look not just that the low end of the wage scale but also the top end what can we do to prevent these really obscene levels of income and wealth concentration at the top better so damaging to our economy our democracy\nNot to mention just a moral outrage and in a country that that is so wealthy\nAnd so I'm really excited about a new tool we have for doing this this year for the first time in history publicly held companies have to report the gap between their CEO and their work or pay\nThe numbers coming out are staggering at Walmart it's a thousand to one at at McDonalds it's three thousand to one and we can build on that information\nTo incentivize companies to to narrow there gaps and just one quick example Portland, Oregon introduced the world's first tax penalty on companies that pay their CEO\nMore than one hundred times their median worker pay this year they're going to put the revenue from that into homeless services and it'll hit companies like Wells Fargo and\n[noise] [noise] [noise] oh from Woods Hole that's cool okay so\nYou're listening to the Cape and

I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany and Rebecca and I have been talking about it was interesting because\nThere are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she she was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the u._s. open I Believe\nAnd so in that moment there were two very distinct are sponsors of the responses of the people that really just wanted to see her in isolation acting um\nIt and this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of the power dynamics in the moment in history in the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced\nAnd so I think that one thing that has been unexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine\nIn understanding women as\nLeaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict um what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine and the lessons of title nine we ... we tend to think of it as um athletics but it is really about leaders\nAct together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry I think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political life\nSo there were some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper\nI don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova was response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said marching speaking now said yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards\nBut Serino was wrong her encore behavior wasn't appropriate paraphrasing just because men region umpires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right and a champion like Serena should not emulate it\nRight I'm Martina Navratilova was wrong\nOr she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it as a moment of solidarity she tried to police arenas conduct I'm as a lifelong tennis fan I'm I Am limited but Martina Navratilova reminded me that up until this moment\nMost white women in tennis have not been allies of the Williams sisters I'm dumb when I watch tennis with my friends were African American tennis fan we often talk about watching these matches on you because of the micro aggressions that come from white women\nWho are often knocking at the Williams sisters and having things to say but let me also add\nThat one of the things that was most infuriating about watching the way in which Ramos treated Serena was that there was a broader context to her anger not only did he accused her of cheating but this also came out on the heels of reports that members of the USDA had been showing up to her house\nUnannounced and testing her over and over again on grounds that maybe she was doping even though she has come clean on every drug tested even those statistics show that they were testing her double the amount that they were testing any other players on the women's side and so she has been subjected to repeated indignities\n[noise] today at noon on WC AI\nSupport comes from you and from Bridgette Montessori school in Shanghai more where they learn to dig deep educating children from

for New York magazine and the cut author of good and mad Bernie Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage and also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book\nRage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment that said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment of Hillary Clinton and the twenty sixteen campaign and I want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for\nNavigating the shoals at how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton has a history of being\nVery careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America and in fact it was news in the two thousand and eight campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle and a half\nSo now a lotta people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was tone police listen\nI regret deeply\nHow angry\nTone of the campaign came [noise]\nYour fault says one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately in that in Hillary fashion says I regret how nasty the campaign became\nA ... just this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's laughing here in the studio with me but how does that strike you [laughter] know she was off ... she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting on it I mean\nI think it was um\nIt was ridiculous that this woman was called an authentic while being held to the standard of care full control\nParents and her body and her motive expression I mean the two candidates um that were her primary opponents for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders\nCould act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they could pound podium you know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord ... is so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton\nBoth Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political pressed for their particular skill and channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift they were able to give voice to this frustration and we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion\nAnd yet every time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ... a a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough sad smile is if it was like some cat\nColor on the street smile more um she was told that regularly and I think that that's again an example of of not having that\nTool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in our own memoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her\nAnd how menacing and aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but that she was thinking no no no that's\nGonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad it's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us is about how much energy\nWomen expand modulating considering strategizing thinking tactically\nHow to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically\nEffective and and I think that that's something that that all three of us are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expression\nNow I Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last ... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger\nGoes because this is a moment in America and let's be realistic\nMoments have a way of fading they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nMaybe the cameras in all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Brittany Cooper are not as interested anymore you know in in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many want listeners I Want to play you another mash up of some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling\nMy name's Aaron I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is Sarah from Cincinnati when I let my anger bubble over and I get really angry out loud it\nIt really doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as being angry are overreacting women yelling even in this day and age that very acceptable men don't seem to have that same problem and I'm\nStarting to feel like maybe it's not just a personal issue I'm dealing with with a call to be nice and and uh and keep our mouth shut however\nI Am so angry so angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm turning my anger into action guess it helps to feel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging I think that but when that have to do we have to take that anger hold on to it and that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from listeners women who it feels like there's a the mirror transferring\nSome of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action industries taking action maybe at the ballot box we got this tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville I'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office\nI'm running for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on\nMy determination to be a voice for all and the focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracey as one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation of Brittany Cooper I Want to talk about where\nThis goes in terms of maybe the midterms that might be the most immediate effect um I\nWhen you contribute to double UCI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support WBAI at Cape and islands dot org or mad women are going to vote and women are going to form a title even twenty Eighteen one way or the other\nAbsolutely and that is as it should be um I'm particularly heartened by uh the Stacey Abrams campaign down in Georgia we have the opportunity to have the\nFirst black woman I'm governor of a state of a former slave state um the ... campaign they're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing we've been seeing that since twenty six team we had a wave of a progressive\nAs sort of radically progressive black mayors in the deep south and so one of the things that I Want to challenge folks to do as we think in this moment is to actually look at what people of color are doing not just women but we're particularly black women in these elections the\nWays that we have the channeling our anger on for decades and decades and that started with the way that we voted for Hillary Clinton in this most immediate political moment but to your earlier point about whether or not\nOur anger can be sustained\nUm I think that I think that this can be sustained I think that we have to remember that the women's movement in this country do it goes through ebbs and flows has really been a solid political project since uh depending on how you count eighty thirty one or Eighteen", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day":
