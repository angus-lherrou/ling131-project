A. M. U.\nDot org before we keep going and introduce our next guests I just want to kind of add a yes any men to what the deal you just said there is no shame and getting a career that doesn't require a college degree not\nAnd we did the show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of the skilled trades that requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute for workplace skills and innovation\nWrote a book called the job of you and he put a question to answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work once you do you consider taking one where do you go to find one you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures without a four year degree\nDot for that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org before we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing is a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is it just an aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways than that but I think\nThe main thing that is that what she right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year it's sort of lagging this prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs Joe yet by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main a stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down\nTurn kind of reverse course and started becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers so that they're in wise to crunch\nGlad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management had been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted like his billion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education\nAnd pay a third of what is manageable let's try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine\nWelcome thank you Ryan\nCan you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture as we've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level sure what I think that it's an ...\nUnderstand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity a start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also a tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places\nAre at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently that describes how over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a text club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nSo I actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I liked that kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that\nOr we don't say there's a shortage I think the same logic applies to the labor market they in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity in the national data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages\nAs employers compete for workers and we just haven't observe that you know overall real wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins are for example a wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions throwing a bit faster in New England in the Pacific states but uh but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that\nThey were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who worked for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field or it's enough to attract and keep people willing to do the ...\nWages not supply and Christine car and wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage thousands traveled to Massachusetts daily where the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\nFor well I and I don't have any empirical data on why so many uh employees are working in math and traveling there that I Know and I live there that they put it over as a million or caters everyday into the city and out and many of those are coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we as into the jobs that are out there\nWhat do you see is the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\n... ah [noise] you know I feel like you know my point of view is I'm sort of a wider industry perspective in in the sense that I work in technology for the last ten years\nAnd coming to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high demand um occupation such as automotive construction manufacturing\nJust seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's in manufacturing or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about\nThe nature of will be described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed to all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs you're in Manchester we've been out of work for at least six months I've overheard conversations in my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen year olds ages them is a big problem\nSupport for NPR comes from

Bo and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers\nChris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics\nI Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties they want to experience people at relatively low wages right off the street\nIf you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voice mail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics in or out and supply chain industry\nAnd we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months\nAnd we're really struggling with two items one is employed turnover aware of their uh chasing higher wages and and new facilities are new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so\nHaving unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting\nLogistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade job shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be\nI Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in I Will withhold my thoughts on your abandoning your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but this listener has an interesting point\nCities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers to the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAn accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan was the idea of Randy ... the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to winning\nThanks Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\nAnd come home award program that we lost in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship business models on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarships of talk about and doing that but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly upon completion of some kind of degree\nBut only if you return to our region to live and work and it's really a home home reward\nPaying off of that so this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair county\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that if they have some family connection here there's probably a better that they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county paint me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America a it's a lot of friends community along the shores of Lake Huron in St Clair river um our largest town of course Iran has a population of about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did I have a fortune five hundred company in our region\nA thirty percent of our workforce leaves our county and heads down in metro Detroit to to be employed\nBut they love the small town life or the family friendly environment amenities are were small town America\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside of Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier jobs I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged on the economic health of regions like port Huron are Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan\nAre are true how how did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people get their pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come on program was once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was philanthropies government business\nAny other sector we realize that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan\nIt had to be an organic plan that that drove our prosperity\nWe're speaking to Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair talented in St Clair accounting Michigan also still speaking to us T.

U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments including some of your commenting about this Elizabeth Warren's story Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren released this DNA results\nYou showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing the story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to Andy's comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in some of these arguments that's what fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that's what could help Republicans I'm sort of succeed in the midterms and it's a dangerous strategy for ...\nI read still seems to be that static but we'll see how things play out very well to go ahead for like a it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandros saying look this is what happened in two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio J uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook 'em out um and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and that that meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff\nJosh will view of the way in which um you know a parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections are founded telling that the gifts that they brought up\nA typically these would be people you know our presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael ... an Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've the people who've drawn the most attention of and the people who have cast themselves as Trump antagonist and\nUh the coffers of local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know the mid term to appear least their favorite both sort of an all against all on the question of prompt\nAnother politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week\nHe democratic he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke people are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at what point at one point Franco or ... what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\n[noise] um you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races it's ... it's been the most fascinating race probably a throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nUh for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know tried not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he's but he's been dropping in the polls and he's he's had to take a new tack\nUsing this language of lying in bed I'm attacking them about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for work\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you\nKnow there's a lot of hope for Beto O'Rourke some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like a that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexandra I was going to ask you whether or not or what you read was on whether this could work I mean ... I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether\nThey rather progressive Democrat like a war has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved the needle\nI mean broadly it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in the mid ... typically you know not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there's a major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which\nOn election day of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think\nAnd under covered aspect of this raises the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go in ... for Republicans and the strength of the Republican Party over all the strength as Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who is running\nYou know against Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties um seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if that are over work has been able to keep them to single digits\nI just wanna make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ... and says Republican and it automatically accounts that vote dressed county for all the Republicans on the ticket\nYet you can basically do for every Republican all at once I'm this is the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that uh it will be as easy will\nFundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're doing\nThe one Monday and the results look\nPretty good for Democrats and house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fund raising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers outraged Ninety two Republican incumbents more than sixteen democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars that corner\nIn the Senate Democrats are also out raising Republicans Beto O'Rourke raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races also glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas\nKaren tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continued to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nYeah there are still people missing there's still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think\nThe town and Mexico beach has not reporting given any numbers\nUm of how many people are are missing 'em but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this\nWas a massive storm I'm Talking about one of the biggest storms out of the top three or perhaps by some accounts that you know had made landfall and that would make it bigger than Katrina\nThis has been a huge effort many people still do not thousands still don't have a phone service on and people are expecting asked film is sewn services restored and more roads are clear it and you're able to get more to people that they're expecting the death toll to continue to

still a little bit more time to get in your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from across the country one a ... W. A. M. U. dot org Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire\nThe race in district one will be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress\nHis Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district that Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen right\nFraming and party departed from two thousand eight or the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats winning in presidential years is now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's\nRetiring I'm In ... ad where do you have people who are running really within the mainstream of their parties are pappas has been serving in various\nElective offices for a long time he's in his late thirties he says family owns a\nVery popular restaurant in Manchester often to stop for presidential candidates\nHe um he comes from Manchester which is a town the where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters\nUm Eddie Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time led the states uh enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores liquor is controlled by the state uh I was a fairly big job he a ram enforcement division and he's been a police chief\nUm you know they were pretty much keeping to well within the norm to their party Eddie Edwards is you know embrace Donald Trump Rudy Giuliani up here campaigning with them\nUm and he's in some ways trying to cast Chris ... says you know part of some sort of resistance movement and saying we've obviously the nationally Chris Pappas as you know hardly a radical guy or you know family um run restaurant a you know work on work for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um\nRace is one where the seat can go either way and ah both parties believe they have a shot\nThere's also a gubernatorial race underway here the Republican government Governor Crist new new\nFaces Democrat Molly Kelly she was one of the Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number\nThe latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that Kelly the Democrat has outraged Sununu the incumbent Republican three to one a ... here since ... brand of New York came to conquered on yesterday to helped campaign for Kelly\nThey met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave if I'm interested in where this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but here as part of what happened with your ... listen\nIt's going to help families here and now we're going to help people to be more productive at work and so\nIt's a win win everywhere I go in that state I hear about the need for paid family medical leave and how important it is\nFor people to be able to have the choices in their life to be able to work hard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they loved that most when they're needed them out\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator ... brand was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is this paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will it's\nBeen a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test me she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue um it's a challenge of somebody covering for how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling that suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue he was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it\nAt the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction imagine to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\n'em in the Democrats believe this is a need for that works for ... by dint of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who worked her way through college and that you know pursue new new sort of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh\nYou know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get at New Hampshire has kind of a bifurcated economy uh uh you know boom times for people the upper income we have budgets\nAre up but you know their wage growth for people the lower end of the scale\nHas not been great and this is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes in may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race well I'm ...\nYou know ... should win you know we have to your terms here no governor has been talks after one term\nUh since two thousand four and prior to that it had been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those\nUh here polling indicates new news up by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers and Molly has outrageous person in three to one in the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch to this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he he'll free ... doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only he's got a four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand you know interest groups will will add to that in terms of advertising but\nThis is a race Democrats feel they have a chance to win if if a blue wave a venture awaits them they think that Molly Kelly a buy dinner background but it'd be a woman is somebody who perhaps his best engineered to kind of ride away speaking\nOf nationally known names Frank or don't is I Wonder what your senses of senator ... brand making this trip to help Mali Kelly is their speculation about her future maybe in twenty twenty\nThere's a lot of speculation about her future and twenty twenty on I think how much is it kinda resonate as as the big question I mean obviously ah there's so many names being kicked around uh right now or that you know it I think time will tell but there there's no question that code ran is one of the people that\nThat people are talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move\nOr that she makes on is being picked apart um you know analyze a and looking for how it could mean and how it could uh what impact that could have on twenty twenty\nLots to discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because the Treasury Department revealed this week that the deficit has grown last year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred sixty six billion\nThis week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars it's a six year high end projection say it is on track\nA trillion dollars the deficit a trillion dollars now Alexander some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being responsible for this particularly the tax bill\nPart of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts is it by cutting taxes business what kind of unleash more productivity the economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest with more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out so far\n... well we haven't seen that yet certainly an advantage Republicans are arguing that that's going to take 'em you know about a decade to even out though at this rate although the economy is booming there's ... there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at at this point\nUm it was sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around was welfare reform\nUm to to cut down on the deficit and that conversation has started again on Capitol Hill I'm that obviously won't move forward until after the midterms but there is conversation about to get you know starting to work on\nA welfare reform bill that would cut some public benefits um like Medicare that kind of thing um and so going forward you know it's interesting they care to see Republicans silence on this issue when they were previously the party of deficits\n[noise] really goes a long way\n[noise] I'm patio high [noise] you're listening\nTo the Cape and

journalists to criticize Tim Trump goes along with both anyone else worried about the u._s. abandoning our moral authority\nSonia wrote on our Facebook page here's what I don't understand a Saudi national was grabbing the Saudi embassy in Istanbul it's been determined that ... was murdered based on recordings hurt by no one but some Turkish government officials who want to remain anonymous\nTurkey has not released the recordings but there have been leaks of what's in them Turkey's government not above repression and this kind of nefarious behavior\nWe supposed to do as an uninvolved third party\nBefore I let you respond to that was your boots weeded and uninterested third party hardly ... was a legal permanent us resident with children who are us citizens the usa isn't interested party even if Trump is not interested in the euro would you respond to that\nYeah absolutely I think it's right that were not an uninvolved third party this man was a resident he was not only that he was a columnist for a prominent American newspaper the Washington Post\nAnd let's be honest that a lot of the reason this has gotten so much attention in this country is because the post has rightly put a huge in hot spotlight on it and not let anyone forget about it and you know other newspapers in the United states in world media have picked up on it too and really kept the attention on it I was struck\nBy President Trump saying yesterday when he finally acknowledge that yes it appears this man was murdered that he said this story has captured the world's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it it is the job of the media to demand accountability to seek truth\nAnd our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world\nPart of that is about moral values and when we have a very close ally who by the way our military hardware is used in that Saudi campaign in Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians and children and is now leading to a huge famine in Yemen\nHow can we say that weren't uninvolved party um you know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies\nAnd it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who is alleged to have done something like this we have certain forms of leverage that include arms sales and include potential sanctions right and many other things\nWill say though I I'd dreams I Do kind of feel worse Sonja is coming from in a way because and we've talked about this on this program before the U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship\nBut we've never tried to exert strong moral ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that one is on entangled but I kind of takes on your point like the U.S\nDoesn't really want to have to spank Saudi Arabia over its actions because there is a tremendous military and economic untangle months so\nI I'm not really sure what the us has the power\nMoral authority to do it well this is the let me ... me amplify that point Josh represents absolutely critical you know ... someone who's been actually very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point in them paraphrasing here\nThat all the money in the world and all of US military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalists for their opinions that's an international norm there's a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's like a critical one\nI mean the show is called ... for the first amendment with that is in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world and if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a Senator Rubio said will never be able to buy our credibility back on these issues\nSenator Lindsey Graham made a very similar point he was so angry and he said I've been a huge ally as NBS in Saudi Arabia but I'm never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan issue\nThan have it is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published what is believed to be ... g's final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and Arabic and he writes about the systemic the systematic dismantling of the free press and much of the Arab world here's one\nBrief quote from that column quote these actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence\nAs a result Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate unquote\nHayes what do you think is he right\nI think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region\nIs that oftentimes strategic interests have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues under the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but if not indeed we never halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOr despite the ongoing campaign in Yemen we never a threatened to sanction them over a there as you over their funding of hottest and other extremists in Syria we never have really taken very strong

in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nBefore it it I Hope that we have the fortitude to actually the people in ... that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually pass some sort of legislation that or does something if the Trump Administration does not but it seems unlikely given the history of the issue\nSo basically the people who killed ... may get away with is that he may never really know who killed him there may never be any real prosecution because of just the cold hard fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis is a business relationship\nAnd you you've totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been wrote killers who took out to show G and reporting earlier this week that said that the U.S is actively working with the Saudi Government to try and come up with some sort of feasible solution that admits the death of show gee but does not blame ... Solomon\nA coach or a dress reckon I coming out of that because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to to Saudi Arabia was to say that look\nUm you have to get out in front of this this is that you cannot sweet to some of the rug I'm absolutely convinced we are going to get to the bottom of this because there's just so much evidence that the Turks now have\nThey've photographed these Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve but which part of\nThe ... the crown prince of security detail or intelligence services\nI think we're going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a fall guy but somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that maybe they are going to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral ... theory as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to ... you know offer up a a senior scapegoat\nBut I'm I'm pretty convince we're going to figure out what happened to her\nWell we will keep an eye on the story we're glad to get some more of your comments on this for now let's move on to some of the other big stories that make news\nThis weekend may have flown under your radar because of all the attention about ...

A. M. U. dot org\nThis week some Americans were probably green with envy and our neighbors to the north\nRight out guy now\nI got out\nThey were celebrating in Montreal this week because on Wednesday Canada legalize recreational marijuana\nNationwide it's only the second country in the world to do so why was the first in twenty Thirteen Andrew tweeted Canada legalizing we'd was like California legalizing we'd both for like a long relationship where you've been dating forever but just now made it official\nHays how big a deal is this and do you think this is the start of a Global Trends something that has just kind of been understood for a long time and just hasn't been made official yet\nYou know that's a great question because I'm not really sure I mean I think that when you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal\nThan at you compare that to things like the un officer drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that it you know marijuana is this evil so it's really tough to tell where the global feeling is on we legalization\nIf um you were to bring it up say at a meeting in the European Union's\nOf European Parliament then I'm guessing you still would not have been nearly a majority of people in favor it even in a place like the USO ... Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana which it it is doing now compared to you know being a private business\nUh that private but illegal business among many small dealers or it's\nAnd whether uh there's going to be any sort of shift in you know I'm sure that can is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether it causes a surgeon traffic accidents where the clause asserted tops realization or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada\nYeah the CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't\nDriving stone it is of course worth noting that in this country marijuana is considered the most illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there\nWith heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use and the high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd ... who was an official with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all into the United states so yes that's awful\nThat's Todd oh one of US Customs and border patrol in the ... give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing the NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was this updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things packed them on to NAFTA and set it snapped a to point no but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know this people are saying that essentially this is a potential marijuana mess right now I'm so I think this could be an issue because we certainly do not have legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis\nAlso James what other kind of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean\nJustin Trudeau now has to kind of own this whether it's seen as a good move or a negative move there remains the question as to what legalization of the national level mind me for Canada on top of that there are early reports that suggested supplies are running low because candidates takes time to cultivate the point of being syllable and they're\nI was running out I Wonder what kinds of additional unintended consequences we might keep an eye out for a\nWhile you know the Canadian Medical Association journal called this a an uncontrolled experiment so we're gonna we're gonna find that a lot of things about this but I must admit that I'm not\nThat surprised when you can walk into the major states the United states like Colorado or California and there's dispensaries for recreational marijuana everywhere I think this is a trend that's happening\nAll over the United states and it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna keep going because people are going to realize that there's a lot of money to be made when you've packed marijuana\nA and the use has happened in any way and putting these people in jail is probably not the best use of public funds so I see it as part of a continuum I think it was kind of inevitable that are progressive neighbors to the north for probably going to get a jump on some of this\nBut um you know I just been struck by going around the country and see in states where this is already happening and everyone kind of shrugs it's not a big deal\nYou know this doesn't seem James to have the kind of energy I mean it's not like the fight of love against prohibition you know where it was considered this major like if issue about liberty and of course it help spur the rise of organized crime if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this feels very much like something that was just\nKind of a matter of time like if they legalize it was going to happen sooner or later\nThat's my sense too yeah that is the trend is pretty clear in this country and and Canada can has had medical marijuana says two thousand and one it's very popular so too does not out on a limb by endorsing the so I I think it's a it's kind of inevitable\nYeah not one of the loudest most aggressive social movements with regards to the legalization of cannabis a much more impactful movement that has reverberated around the world is the me too movement and we should talk about that before our time is up this week MJ Akbar who's the minister of state for external affairs in India\nLeft that post after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual assault\nAnd harassment also in India this week there were protests and violence meant by that but any woman trying to enter the ... temple in ... state in India groups of conservative Hindu men threw stones and attacked women and journalist who tried to get too close let's start with this story involving\nEnergy Akbar Hays how have we seen the me too movement play out\nIn India is this just kind of the beginning of its effect on men in power\nI think so it's it's interesting because the me too movement really kicked off here in the United states a year ago and for a while\nBut ... and wondering when is it going to affect this culture where\nAre we were so sure that it would finally have an impact and now a in recent weeks it has finally like grab the country and shaking it\nUh we Steve is all started with one actress a one Bollywood actress coming forward and just it's been a tidal wave of accusations sense than women taking to Twitter and being unafraid to name their alleged abuse abusers and assaulted by name\nAnd just being really willing to step out and do what the Indian courts haven't done before which is try to bring these men into account\nAnd um it's it's really interesting that ... one of the first to go considering um he had such a long run in the Indian journalism scene and\nUh the most of the women who came forward about him were fellow journalists were fellow reporters so I feel like that is a bit of credence to these allegations and we'll see whether in the future they uh the the women who are I guess lower down on in social status will finally start to be believed as well\nWith regards to the protests at the ... temple and Carol estate the BBC's dreams Clinton was they're asking people why they were protesting here's what one man said\nNo no no no no no no no the media and it turns out to making this among them they don't really", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city":
