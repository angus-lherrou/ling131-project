A. M. U. dot org with regards to cyber hacking Michael asks with the loss and result in widespread dissemination of the CIA tool kit which allows one to spoof packing from another country how can cyber bread crumbs lead to certainty that in other countries actually guilty\nDavid what do you think well cyber attribution is something that people are getting a lot better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems\nAh years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern part of the U.S\nBut the fact of the matter is that a combination of forensic evidence a motive\nPast use so similar tools can get you most of the way most of the time so there are some pretty good ways to go do it the bigger\nOnce they've found this out and perhaps decide to announce it as happened in these most recent cases than the political pressures on them so what do you do about it\nThat's why the president signed a new set of executive orders and I'm\nIn August we haven't seen them they're all classified that pushes down into the system\nOr the ability for commanders in the U.S\nTo do cyber attacks back without having presidential sign off\nTill now that's been something that the only only the president could authorized the use of nuclear weapons and cyber weapons now it's not entirely clear that only he can authorize the use of cyber weapons in retaliation but you want to make sure you're attribution pretty good before you strike back you know who to attack\nYeah great married before we move on from this first of all that is no small thing that that the U.S military might have the latitude unilaterally to\nShut down a power grid or turn off or you know hydroelectric dam through the Internet\nBut beyond that do we have a sense that\nCertain countries certain organizations are getting a better handle on dealing with cyber attacks the world clearly hasn't figured this out is anyone making progress I think about the EU because I hear so much about Internet regulations from there on a consumer level but on a military level is anyone making progress\nOr not that I'm aware of the U.S I think it's still the world leader and in in terms of a you know advanced Internet abilities and and the threats are pretty clear or Russia or China and North Korea or Iran\nBut a ... figuring out or response and how you want to calibrate that response so it doesn't become this open ended escalation and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond or you you're entering really uncharted territory\nVivian do we get a sense of countries beginning to kind of work together to figure this out to to figure out some kind of international response to cyber attacks or his Russia really got the whole world kind of running with here on\nThe what we've seen in the last couple of days is coordination of um indictments and ... you know raising concerns about I'm signing an otherwise obviously there's a lot of discussions that are taking place\nWhere countries our western allies trying to coordinate some kind of effort to counter\nThe threat that that that the Russians posed but at the same time again you have so many ah restrictions and so many um uncertainty as to how to approach the cyber world in general on cyber threats and as David said the U.S try\nPack plan or something to counter to protect our infrastructure so that we don't have um we're not as vulnerable as we've seen ourselves\nIn the past but obviously you know the U. S. is still trying to figure out a way forward I'm having looked at what happened to us and the two thousand six you know action still we're talking about the fact that we are vulnerable in two thousand Eighteen we could be vulnerable on twenty twenty so we haven't actually tried quite figured out how to protect ourselves get alone\nThe world's kind of coordinating on a global scale to do the same it's it's it's not an easy task\nAlthough it's funny kind of a decentralization of the way that we vote that we are so many different kinds of voting systems might you know way kind of how it helps a lot it helps insulated from according to the fact that we've got all these different utility company yeah that you know ... but but the key element here as we've done a better job at\nDiscussing internally how we would do counterattacks than we have organizing the world than the sort of digital Geneva Convention what standards of what's on limits and often it\nLet's shift gears and talk about the Nobel Prize is particularly the Nobel Peace prize the winners were announced this morning Dr Denis ... and ... one for their work combating sexual violence as a weapon of war\nThe announcement from the Nobel Committee said in part quote Dennis ... Luke ... is to help or who has devoted his life defending these victims nutty a rod is the witness who tells the abuses perpetrated against herself and others\nWere rod is an Iraqi woman she was captured and held by the Islamic state escaped captivity after three months in told to her story in a book called the last girl\nDr ... founded a hospital in eastern Congo that's treated thousands of women many of whom are survivors of gang rape ... pretty extraordinary people to be winning this prize especially as we've learned more about how sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war and as for quite some time\nYeah really has to two individuals who seem really deserving the peace prize has been a lot of had a lot of controversy in recent years very politicized\nA couple of people who really been thrust into dangerous situations handle that with with incredible courage and Dr ... up built this hospital in eastern Congo which is in the middle of nowhere and just a very remote region\nTwenty years ago for maternal care they're just as much health care of that was his intent but as the Congolese civil war metastasize um rape became a huge issue\nPeacekeepers were involved in in rape there and so he became the voice of rape being used as a weapon of war and so he's been asked this for Twenty years very prominent a voice but still operating in a very a a dicey region of very deserving winter\nI mean I I can really speak for the case of um ... who I I spend a lot of time in Iraq and two dozen Fifteen sixteen\nI'm interviewing gives you the women who were released from captivity from ISIS and\nThe impact yeah obviously psychologically\nUm physically or the the the use of sexual assault\nAnd rape as a tool in war is obviously a huge thing but you have to also remember that these women go back to their\nTried to go back home a lot of their family shunned them because of cultural sensitivities to such things and so their lives are essentially up ended by this their families a lot of times don't take them back home a lot of these women were impregnated I'm as a result of this and had to really know where to go because\nThey were single mothers which in Iraq is is just\nCompletely a taboo and so uh you know it's something that you should raising awareness for this is something really really important and you had a lot of people on the ground in Iraq trying to educate these families that this is not of no faults to the women that they had no say in the matter but\nObviously you know changing cultural perceptions is it's it's an uphill battle and so this woman obviously I'm trying to do that and it's a it's it's worth the the know notoriety that she's getting\nLet's shift gears and talk about China vice president Mike Pence spoke yesterday accusing China of trying to sway American public opinion and undermined the Trump Administration\nTo put it bluntly President Trump's leadership is working in China wants a different American first there can be no doubt China is meddling in America's democracy David what is\nVice president Pence mean by meddling what do we know about what China actually use do well it's it's pretty fascinating because he is appropriating the language of the Russian attacks from on the twenty\nSixteen election and transferring it over to a different set of activities that the Chinese are are involved in that there's no question that the Chinese have views cyber before in for political purposes but they largely haven't used it here they've used it in Taiwan they've used it\n\n[noise] [noise]

sexual misconduct\nFeinstein was preceded by Senator Chuck Grassley the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee who bemoan the process and slam Democrats for their treatment of the nominee\nWhat

reimposed sanctions Iran took the U. S. to court the international court of justice to Akron argue that the u._s. actions violated the terms of the Nineteen fifty five treaty of amity\nWell the Trump Administration hit back this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the U.S is ending that treaty\nThis is a decision frankly that his thirty nine years overdue\nIn July around ... case and the international court of justice alleging violations of the treaty of amity or on six to challenge the United states' decision to seize participation in the Iran nuclear deal and to reimpose the sanctions were lifted as part of that deal\nArise attempted interfere with the sovereign rights of the United states to take a waffle actions necessary to protect our national security and a rod is abusing the ice and Jay for political and propaganda purposes\nThat was secretary of state Mike Pompeo speaking on Wednesday Vivian salami some have said that ending this treaty is largely symbolic or is that so\nI think um in general it's more just I'm reinforcing the administration's are standing efforts to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and um crackdown on Iran and kind of show that they're not messing around and so\nI'm basically this was just one more step in that process but as far as any real uh changes on the ground it really doesn't do much it's really just our sponsor\nTo on the international court of justice says ruling that ah that essentially said that sanctions on that day re imposing sanctions on were not fair to Iran\nBring my we step back for just a second what is this treaty of amity [noise] uh I'm sure that was a question if the state department I just had this vision of some low level staff are going through the basement looking treaty\nOr am I think it's really I'm damage could result thing for what I heard about you know the the big acronym of Jaycee peel away the Iran nuclear deal but what is this treaty of amateur\nWell in Nineteen fifty three the U.S helped orchestrate a coup in Iran bringing the shah of Iran back to power\nOr they were us and Iran were buddy buddy at that time and so two years later\nIt's yeah you brought me back to power shirt treaty of amnesty great and they were indeed good friends from fifty three until the Seventy nine revolution misses the shah who was deposed in Islam role in the Islamic Revolution of ... Seventy nine\nSo for thirty nine years uh there has been no enmity between us in a rod um this again seems very symbolic\nI'm just a last little relic that somehow didn't get shredded after the the the revolution Seventy not\nIt was the last hurrah of Kermit Roosevelt grandson of Theodore Roosevelt CIA operative who almost singlehandedly staged this coup and then they got everybody we put in power to go sign the treaty\nPort Kermit he's getting no respect from the state department these days are males they was Carmen Roosevelt\nI'm taking it I I liked that name for for a man who had such a history Kermit Roosevelt and I know where the American David ... is there any real effect in terms of the sanctions the consequences to the U. S. for refusing to lift them if this treaty of Emmett see\nIs more symbolic we're might there be more tangible impact\nSo the tangible impact is November when President Trump has said that he will impose the full sanctions on Iran He's given allies warning that this is coming and\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support WBAI at Cape and islands dot org\nUnited States and it's an effort to choke off the Iranians\nBy making the big aircraft makers Boeing's ready pulled out the big um oil a production equipment makers all get out of Iran and they were doing that what's happening now though is that the ... the Europeans are saying we're going to find a mess it\nTo buy oil from Iran without clearing it in dollars so that the u._s. can affect that with the sanctions\nAnd a number of us went up and met a with the Iranian foreign minister when he was at the un\nAh last week and he made an argument to us was Saturday evening that he believed that this method was going to come together so we're heading toward a conflict between\nThe U.S and its European allies over on do we have a sense I think I feel like the the big issue really is runs nuclear program\nAnd the argument from the other nations who are still signatories to this this deal the Iran nuclear deal\nIs that it's it's not perfect but it's good and that it has done something to impede Iran's ability to develop\nA nuclear weapon do we have a sense of where we stand in that regard setting the economic stuff aside for a moment just this put us any closer on that path or we still kind of in a holding pattern I mean what is what's that looks like", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Brewster", "day": "06"}
