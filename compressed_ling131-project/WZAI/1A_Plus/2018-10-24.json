A. M. U. dot org\nAnthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from that\nSide that are acquaintance ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and now in times past than [noise]\nThe edge you say to threaten to run yeah threatened to run yeah LA's a higher than run for president are going to support Romney 'cause you know I decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there is something a little short of about the word threatened not he floated the idea where he hinted at a rally threatened\nYeah that's a go go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party\nIt was a threatening to run and that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know if you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president was sort of like that sort of a threat but uh you know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person as a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature of the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your a bottle you know so for me on my love coming on NPR all go on the left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalist interviews\nBecause I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said that he spent a lot of time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side in that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way\nIf I got to the other side and weaken my argument that I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from them\nWell and there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press as a communications director where you tried to convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you've said that\nIt it pushes back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive I hear you on that\nBut the president didn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nNo no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know like if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment\n... and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so having the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody lead did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press and servicing all parts of the press so it didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything I only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call on CNN had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I wanted to send a message to those people that hey we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business\nAnd you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I built my own business and you know came from scratch so I went into the square ought to I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanna previous ban and out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly and the job\nIt was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president\nAnd even if I accepted a subordinate role which I would've been happy to do is I'm a team player\nI don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker\nI have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality\nOr does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying to work well having you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for him to even be on the on that list\nBut as far as like me any more than he likes the price of oil and your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press he could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean\nI get the sense that the president just didn't agree with that [noise] um no\nActually ... you know ... there's a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I've been announces ... over him and I alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and say it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI listen to what you declaring war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media for we going to lose that war\nPresident that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well when you weigh better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president is a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him but for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism\nLet him parity with Leslie stall let him have a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had him in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people that don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in a way of a really good story or we know that about the president's or there's a lot of people inside of calm seem like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like mala props and him telling these\nAre stories that were on average ... maybe a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm just saying inaccurately and and clearly in consistently over ... listen I just left a morning show where these guys like but they\nThey rail on them all day and night and so and they're calling them a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that and I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want\nAll that stuff to be dial down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to so so but but we had to do then is you've got to tell them straight yesterday man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he'll say back to you as well it's energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nA ... and this is always going to be as ... as long as Donald Trump is the president United States it's going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and the people that don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way there are some

negative about the wind today I have got get ally of such a hypocrite yes we have a ticket for tonight's drawing\nHuh one boy well you\nKnow wait a minute wait a minute you don't already going to wind

you take the cash option then Uncle Sam had hands out like\nI Need Fifteen times in that first year it just it really dwindled deal no please don't get me wrong I down then choose or not to tie and all that but uh [laughter] you know but I Will say that\nYou know it it I'm not going to lie and say that it was a complete cars for my family and when I say my family I'm going to talk about my husband and my two daughters so in so many ways it was a blessing because our parents did share a small portion with my brother and I you know what that means that [noise]\n... Haitian gold I won't go to any school for any amount of time they can do anything they want if you want to travel to Italy to study architecture because that sure drain\nDo it you know ... and that's an absolute blessed that my husband and I both being and solve for sales we would have been able to afford that any way but it's nice to have that cushion right um\n[noise] so there are blessings but I Will say that the women has shown me personally the absolute dark side of human nature and you know it wasn't my women but I have absolutely experienced it I'm sure my parents you know would have many many more storage I'm In\n... in speaking about my parents it's strained relationship you know I've chosen to become extremely private about this when my husband and I moved to a different town to just kind of get away\n[noise] because my parents one and a state where you cannot remain anonymous and for them that with habits because they love to brag about it they loved the lab actually like it like look at me where I'm more of the exact opposite and some of that is just out of fear either I'm I'm kind of\nFear based anyway you know you worry about\nIran's on my way up here at someone hitting them over the head making sure everyone stays home and\nI'm going to know I I Know we've got to move on in in just a moment but I Wonder how you reflect back on that if you could go back to whatever the store was where your parents bought that winning ticket and say something to them before they bought it ... what would you say\n[noise] it would be the same thing that I Would tell\nAnyone who won tonight or if you won two million dollars on two billion dollars that does that matter I think it it's they absolutely need to have the typical advice that you hear you know surround yourself with a great taint a CPA a financial advisor at attorney but not\nBig advice would be to be careful\nThese are not necessarily the people that you went to high school with your office is in a strip mall are handled your last or or whatever you know you've had yeah the scale of your new state has to match their ability to serve you and you know\nIf you can't or may anonymous consider options that allows you to remain as anonymous as soon as possible and then you control the message out you know I I Know that there are ways to do it and I think the last one is to just be

A. M. U. dot org Barbara emailed I still talk weekly by phone to Yemeni friends in ... and ...\nThey are living in hell and they asked why does America hate us so much why does America wants to kill us what do I say\nSome uh before we continue in before we bring in our next voices on the conversation I Wonder if you could just for those people who haven't been following the Yemeni civil war very clearly can you just boil down at the core of it what does this conflict about who are the fighters and what are they fighting for\nSo Yemen's conflict is actually quite complex complex a it's a it's a conflict that has many layers to it but ultimately what you were hearing the news is that's a it's a Saudi Iranian proxy war you also\nGovernment in Sana'a that announced itself is actually in fact a\nA coup government that is run by a militia and that the Saudi Government is trying to restore the legitimate Yemeni government ah to power in Yemen now the problem with all of that as this conflict is failing to do all of the things that they're saying it's a it's about for example\nWhen Saudi Arabia got involved in this conflict with the Arab coalition\nThe aim is to bring back the Yemeni government the Yemeni government has been residing in jail since the war started and uh is struggling to go back to places where there is no who's the militia on the ground\nAnd on top of that the who the militia innocence has gained so much more since the war started in the sense that at first they had to share power with uh the former president of Yemen where you know in two thousand eleven Yemen had a revolution and I'm the president was removed\nBut he ... himself with the ... and was present for some time but I'm the sheer power with him now fast forward three years into the war they had killed them and and now they have their own control of the majority of the north of Yemen\nAnd of course the the scariest thing about this is the Houthi militia had managed to capture the Yemeni military arsenal that belong to the former government is now all in their hand and so in a sense what the war dead is complicate an already complicated political situation\nAnd it devastated the lives of millions of enemies\nUh for example Seventy five percent of the Yemeni population is it is suffering and in need of immediate aid and depend on foreign aid to kind of survive and this is a Seventy percent increase since before the war began um\nBut I Do want us all the above the population on the ground that needs help I just want to before we get to our next wars and also just want to be clear loses sectarian part of this to you know these\nThese who the rebels who kind of came after the government you're Saudi Arabia involving itself but there is the Muslim sectarian aspect to this also is Sunni versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of the people don't realize first of all the Shiite and Yemen I don't practice the same sect of ... that Iran practices or\nThe Shiites in Lebanon are at all to practice they practice a sect called the DSM and the ideas and is known as ... and it's really different from twelve or ... which is a the ... form that\nThing is that it's the closest form of ... that resembles Sunday as them a and Indiana and we the Sunnis there are ... and the divide isn't you know the the ... are not a minority like in other places they're forty five percent of the population\nAnd so what's interesting about this you know Sunni Shia conflict is that it's entirely manufactured in a sense that of course there are differences between these those two sacks of course there are situations where they don't agree but they managed to co exist for many years now the CDs or the who the sect\nOf of you know what's happening in Yemen they're no longer practicing as they do use them as it as it seems like they're trying to politicize safety is them and to kind of a associate themselves more with the Iranian sect of Shia Islam and the ...\nHas struggled to maintain its sex as it is with the influence of well how does them and set up as him coming into the country and so in a sense what you're saying is that the most radical elements of those two\nAre fighting each other and so in a sense you have the presence of a new ... conflict but one thing that I really have to point out to the listeners here is that that's not the only thing going on\nI'm a huge portion of the country in the liberated territory from the control is actually demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south so ever since Nineteen Ninety four the people there felt that they were under occupation and the cost is a session\nAre rising day after day as this conflict continues\nOr do you want to make sure we get to a voice on the ground in Yemen but I hear what you're saying summer in terms of all of these very complex fault lines moved kind of come together to fuel the civil war today before we came on the air today\nWe were able to get through to Sana'a in Yemen all communication into and out of Yemen is really tough but we did make contact with least grounding she's the UN's\nResident and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen least laid out what the conditions are like right now for those who are living and working beer here as part of our conversation that we to just a few minutes ago\nWe've gone to welcome to want to thank you very much can you give me a sense just in a in a larger topics how many people the un fears are at risk of famine right now [noise]\nIn game and we are worried that if steps are not taken right now in order to stop the spread of hunger that we could see as many as fourteen million ... who are ...\nThis is why the United nations is ringing the alarm bells and telling everyone that we are facing possibly the biggest famine in living memory if we don't do something to stop it right now\nWhat are some of the other health risks that you're looking at their other than just starvation I'm sure was deprivation of a reasonable secure supply of food all kinds of other health problems also come into play right\nThat's exactly right last year the largest cholera outbreak in modern history hit ... there were more than a million people who are suffering either from Colorado or from watery diarrhea there had never been an outbreak of such magnitude in living memory\nNow this year because of the road work that's being done by frontline partners and UN agencies and officials here in game and we've been able to contain the spread of how the Democrats have similar levels there's a lot of color in the country but it's not spreading at the rate of his last year\nThat being said when people exist for months and months on supplemental rations\nWhen they are eating limited amounts of food what happens over a period of time is that they slowly start\nAnd this is absolutely what we're saying for millions of people in this country their immune systems are weakening and that makes some highly vulnerable to infections and water borne diseases including cholera\nAnd just by way of context we've mentioned that there are fourteen million people at the un fears are at risk of famine the population of Illinois where we are right now doing this program from Chicago is Thirteen million people just by way of contacts least give me a sense of what\nA mother a father a parent has to do in Yemen right now to try and feed their child continue boils down to what an individual might be dealing with

in Yemen and about the U.S Saudi relationship\nContact us through Facebook our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U.\nDot org before we continue some al Hamdani let me come back to you for a second I checked in with our audience here at W. B. easy in Chicago to kind of ask them if they were tracking with us and one of the things that I think confuses a lot of people it confuses me too\nIs the nature of this sectarian aspect like several of us and we have a an array of of age ranges here students and seniors and everybody in between have heard of Sunni and Shia Muslims\nBut then that like the the sects within the sects I think that's where a lot of us kind of get lost can you can you bottom line that for us what difference does it make what set these people are with like why why does the sects why does the sex involved matter to this\nAbsolutely so when it comes to Yemen like I mentioned uh the majority of the northern part of Yemen is historically has ADD and the majority of the southern portions of Yemen as historically shaft eye and said these can be called Shia and the\nChef ... they're called ... now the ... conflict\nA kind of began years ago and then was revived recently\nUm what we see is the political importation\nOf religious sects of what we're seeing at play as political Islam and that's what you're hearing about you know the chefs in a conflict it's not really a religious matter today it's really a political matter of allegiance to what part of the middle east are you going to support and what we're seeing play out is that\nIran is announcing itself as the I'm kind of the guardian of ... and Saudi Arabia on the other hand is\nPresenting itself to the world is the guardian of ... and so as soon as she our is pretty much kind of people fighting for the interests of who's going to take control in the region\nAnd that's what this what's happening in Yemen you know for instance when this war started\nWe know that the u._s. then under the administration of President Obama had struck a deal of um a nuclear deal with Iran and the sense they sacrificed Yemen by saying here you can fight Iran in Yemen but the U. S. is gonna kind of sign this deal with Iran\nNow that was a short sighted move because I think a lot of people then didn't anticipate that today President Trump would come to power and then today you have and a nuclear deal with Iran a\nAnd at the same time also have this devastating crisis in Yemen and so in a sense okay so\nLet me let me was I think so let me let me back up and try and repeat back to you what you just said that I've been drawn a diagram everybody here ... been watching you scribble in my piece of paper so we've got these these two sets of Islam Sunni Islam and she Islam it's this old centuries old fight that has been made\nPolitical you use the phrase political Islam to describe\nHow we're well on this kind of for political and regional power reasons trying to kind of claim itself as the the defender of the Shia Muslim face and Saudi Arabia has kind of\nAnointed itself the defender of the Sunni Muslim faith and that politicized useless um has spread into other conflicts and ...\nIran and Saudi Arabia are supporting these factions is kind of a battle in this larger war for the soul of political Islam is that kind of it\nSure yeah exactly and so what I'm saying is that historically and traditionally the sect of Islam that ... have practiced for years are not necessarily aligned with the Saudi an Iranian sex but for political reasons they are now aligning with each other gotcha\nGotcha folks here it'd be easy does that make more sense good sums up all around or if you go and I I appreciate you explain that I think\nYou know part of the complication dream Ferguson is that this is\nComplicated I mean some words you can't just\nBoil down to one cause but that also makes it hard\nFor us sworn in Yemen to zero in on them and and really think our teeth in but your reporting has involved some of the people on the ground\nWho are dealing with the results of this larger fight for the soul of political Islam you describe the story of an eleven year old girl that you encountered back in June the kind of stuck with you can you give us the basics of what happened to her\n[noise] sure telling her story is one of the reasons is the most important reason why journalists need access to this because we have to put\nA face and a name and a picture to the statistics otherwise they're just statistics and I think than we we deal with with a lot\nOf uh of of of difficulty trying to get the public to understand the level of this crisis so I ... I was in ... um which is a it probably\nBeen sort of in northwest of of Santa and controlled by the who the rebels and uh and it's meant and us in the in the town of hijacking the capital of the province there was a hospital where like every single hospital that I've seen ... that the children's ward is now a de facto malnutrition wards\nAnd we were just filming there with some women and their babies' whenever a young man\nTall destiny then\nRushed in with the with the tiny what looked like just sort of like a bundle of clothes and it was his eleven year old sister name was ... and for a horrible few moments we really thought may mono might die in front of us on the hospital bed she was eleven years old and way too\nI think twenty four pounds was what it was about what we had to what we had asked at the doctors at that and it was absolutely a horrifying to watch her she you know when when a child gets so weak and so a malnourished they also become so vulnerable\nYou get a diarrhea anyway and so even even if you do manage to get through to them and uh they get diarrhea they get devastating they hydrated as a result the whole thing just spirals until the child's body just gives in\nUm we spent some time they're filming with my own end speaking with her family\nAnd her mother eventually came the next day we were able to talk to her and we were piecing together the family's story and it is a story that reflects\nMillions of people's stories in Yemen and it is that her father was a schoolteacher and a government school but whenever the uh the government salaries stopped\nOver two years ago he his salary stopped to once people lost that level of income the government was that\nThe the biggest employer by far in the country before the war\nAnd that's not just soldiers and police that's people who work in offices that's teachers any kind of clerical work or any kind of bureaucratic work in Yemen\nWants those salaries stopped people would then go on to trying to live off of what the aid agencies would call coping mechanisms to you and I that's simply do have any savings do I have a line of credit at the local store do have any livestock in the backyard do I have relatives who can help us out after two years\nEvery day you're learning something new and open trucks\nYou're listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations a service of W GBH Boston oh\nYou're listening to WBAI your local news and information storage for the ... and the island Ninety plant one WBAI and WBAI H.

A. M. U. dot org before we bring in our next two guests Steve I didn't want to ask you one thing about the way the documentary was made I Wonder how you said about\nTelling the students' stories I mean there is a moment in one episode where either you or a cameraman tries to talk about one student about her cutting class I mean all the kids that you follow go through various struggles with\nIts class with grades with life what kinds of boundaries do you have to set when you're telling a story about high schoolers\nWell that's a great question um I've always tried in the films I've done over the years has to a\n... have the subject feel like they have real agency in the making of what we're doing\nA you know the idea we aim for is is that we're really making the film with them not on them\nAnd yes ultimately we have editorial control but we take very seriously that kind of relationship and on this series it was vitally important that they are also be other filmmakers involved we had a diverse team of filmmakers Kevin ... Rebecca parish being Lou\nCharles' story was followed by Kevin ... I mean I felt a little bit with Charles but that's really Kevin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry ... that that followed a Charles a story and they had to establish these kinds of relationships um that important now the moment you're talking about is with tiara that's actually a story I happen to be following\nAnd you know you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with Tara because she was struggling with a lot of things at that time I thought was relevant to include that in the film\nA few more of your comments before we bring in our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we fail to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people\nPeriod end up sentence\nAgility for fun tweeted I've watched every episode of America to me I absolutely love it I'm shocked at how clueless the white teachers are especially that physics teacher\nThe school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the news for full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Stephen ... for his thoughts on the series we did not get a response but the invitation remains open we also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school Nathan rouse\nWe were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary either is that right see that's all right\nLet's see more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmended Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called\nDespite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to say thanks for having me also with us here at W. B. easy as David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is a Chicago native professor still Volkow thanks so much for have professors have you watched the series any part of it some of it all of that yes\nFestival what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest\nThing that struck me the hardest is an episode to win one of the parents of student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the\nEmpty conversation that we do not have about schools that have the illusion of integration and I said the illusion of immigration because it just means that students of color are in the same place with white students when this mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties\nIn on that fourth floor and he's still happening today that to me is the story of us ... professor Lewis what about you\nOne of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in the series but I think one of the things that struck me as the silences some of that some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate in it wasn't\nOne of the things you notice in that district is that the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families\nA lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like a opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on in the district\nPay by the way for those of you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you were eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so deeply about it in mind in the conversation if you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them tweets do not tweeting me [laughter] 'cause I ruin this film for you I don't want to hear it\nBut if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety at the one a dot org that's the word the the number one letter a dot org we're talking about racial\nEquity professor still vote what does that mean what does racial equity look like is it and making sure that black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people feel\nBeing nice to one another like how would we know racial equity if we had it\nRight I mean I think this is a question I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to him and his point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution\nSo when you talk about redistribution so now the question becomes who has had the least and now what are those things that they talk about that

conversation with professors amend the Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one a tax club how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother text club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to wrap myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like advanced placement courses in international baccalaureate costs\nShips that the way we engage with race in a larger way can push too far that we can give people of color in additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make it\nTo me I I mean it's not a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough right when we talk about equity\nWe have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity and the and how those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one why student did not get one scholarship does not mean that\nBlack and Latino students across the country do not are not see who make Lee denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve what's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to parse out three actions that that finally\nWell I've I've not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise]\nBut you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdote experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience if for no other reason than there are other reasons is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not\nLiving in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some of my past work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white parents\nCharles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for anyone high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin does that reflect your experience and all my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general like those kind of lay her essays\nIt's like you're you know they always going to be warm regardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color there's like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of sleeping bags but we ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who's also feature documentary where like\nI wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to compare thing of the students but the school has like\nI guess prominent interests than us because of what we do without extra curricula and so it was just already saying that they're like okay well we need to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who isn't in any extra curricular lose who doesn't have any type of\nUm non student teacher relationship with any adult in the building they like it's hard you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there the blankets vices sleeping bags whereas like\nAll all the white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have stakes in the school the parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever and then you got the kids who I mean like meat luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to obey but\nOther than that right it was not really so you kinda have to fend for yourself exactly and we like it that's just not the case you know I think it it goes to show and um\nWhich episodes that we must have been doing it was like most of the kids in his honor news um tutoring sessions I usually white fair and are widely so yeah All right and that's that's part like you know personal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to get on his tutoring but I was just the one right the you know so well\nTo that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years [noise]\nKnow it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you can take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like Evan stand like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens of these kinds of districts\nThat tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts we take it that\nSkills coming in and we tracked them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kids don't hire attracts get more they get better and better teaching and so we take his it might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time\nAnd so when we look at schools like a park as Dave said earlier\nThe structures that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks um are inevitably going to uh take\nRacial disparities that exist in our society and and reproduce them at our schools and the the ... the troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how these trucks get created and if you look at the history of the really deep racist history of tracking and general\nRace also becomes explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational spaces in school or Ninety percent white and the least advantage educational experience you know there are places in the same exact school opera nominally black\nShould have us all up in arms that the fact that we think that that's OK is all about our racial mythology\nI I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and what a good education is and you know I've heard a pie teachers including ...
