A. M. U. dot org or give us a call eight five five to three six one a one a apologies to those of you who are trying to call it on the line and we've been getting deluged with phone calls\nSome of which we've had to screen out very quickly that we're going to do our best to put some of the most useful in positive and productive calls on the air\nTo those of you who've been making that job a little bit harder I think it might be worth sharing a comment from Alexander who emailed I have a message for those who hold this kind of hate in their hearts I don't care who you are I don't care what race you are a part of what creed you follow who you voted foreign twenty sixteen I Will find you\nAnd I will love you there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop me\n... let's get back to Thomas comments on Facebook Tommy rights when speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is\nMissy and leads to action one of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab and the kind of online footprint that Robert Bowers had there so uh ... dot com\nIs a sort of a basically a Twitter clone um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racists bigots [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter uh for for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know the absolute power of of free speech but when ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a police where only the sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I ... it it has become a a place where white nationalism a and an extreme\nOr bigotry homophobia whatever ah has has been embraced and and uh and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say his name\nWas maybe not radicalize necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his\nAh truly hateful views it was the last\nPlace where he posted before at the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a a a an unproductive vent for a lot of that hatred I'm an after\nAfter um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active a participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming and realizing this for the first time\nA note noticed that are that at this place is a dark place to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying a words are not bullets in social media posts I have\nA body count at zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action\nAnd I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets anyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWhen it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of free speech communities online that that don't really believe necessarily for speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab devalue space\nConsequences and then there's sort of this you know this odd worked understanding of why protected so hard if it means nothing um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people don't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nRub I ... I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like ... job is not the only place where this kind of speech to lift weights on line it is worth noting since our program one a as maimed up to be First Amendment the first to limit lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of speed and ... that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome folks like you\nShort well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true I've seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to spew such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae ... people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported and embolden from the very top when the president of the United states\nAs an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the last two is in charge we have somebody on the right who is the president at the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist that racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign out before the election in which\nHe highlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and light Blankfein and suggested that they were part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power in the United states of course trap it taps into\nVery old anti Semitic ...\nYeah I I I'm Sorry where am I but I Do want to get a little deeper into that a lot of thought 'cause a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to\nTo get your thoughts at that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday she began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism\nAnd every other form of evil and unfortunately evil comes in many forms and we come together as one American people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nMust stop the opened an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony fake news must end unquote\nRight and I'm looking at a recent update and um it's saying that the storm is pretty strong fast moving moving up over forty miles an hour and a barn civil um there's some the national weather service says you might see some pea sized town when gas up as high as fifty miles an hour there earlier reports of wind gusts\nAs high as a sixty five miles an hour and it's looking like with the special marine

we have another update in regards to this fast moving storm Catherine\nAnd I'm looking at the national weather service a wet website here with a special statement that says the tornado warning for west central ... county has been canceled on the ... the storm has moved out of the area so again\nFor the western part and parcel county there um that storm that that tornado warning is canceled we are still tracking the storm though it is fast moving it's causing some downpours some gusty winds and a little bit of hail even though it's it's certainly something to keep an eye on\n'em although it looks like uh the main threat of a tornado may has now passed\nAt least for those of us on Cape Cod thanks so much for listening to WC I Will keep you updated throughout the morning we returned to one eighty in progress\nAce in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions there needs to be consistent strong resistance to the hateful devices speech that is anti American\nJournalists needs to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism of the president's ignorant rats if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to screen very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks orange forever the show I um I guess I'm speaking as someone who's both religious ... and also very much scientific\nI think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower than on the left of people who have a strong religious is at a close next to the state of Israel I mean I teach at a small just ...\nHerbs and a lot of her students do feel uncomfortable with House bill that um you know if they express a strong and here is that Israel or especially religious views that aren't um\nYou know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you are how the school deals with it\nWell I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we\nMean there are students who are you know are not particularly\nStrongly support of Israel and one way or the other but um when our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly\nIf they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't think it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence from the left and that that's true I think you are seeing and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college\nUm and it's you know I don't know we we felt\nWe do tell kids who probably should need need to shut up you know I Know they show up at the you know you can't argue with every\nJust kind of you're going to have to learn to live with that kind of pick your battles and I think that's a hard thing\nYeah to pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised students to do that and not\nThe not federal everything will David I'm going to be it can be very hard David let me\nPut that to thank you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of David comment\nYou David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say Seventy first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course at high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I let it be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism in Alaska and very often it expresses itself\nAs as attacks on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which it's not and you can criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses the line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of these trials governmental policies that we are all the time speaking out\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nCriticism of a country and its policies that rather crosses over into straight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nWho carry a violent acts and say that they're motivated by hatred of Israel that the targets are actually choose who are shopping in a grocery store in a jewelry store in a synagogue\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's\nDifferent about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is it it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore who's ... who was criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. that instead we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nGet to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation we have as many of your calls as we can't as well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our nation rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strengths and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship help to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better endure would you react to that I feel like part of what\nWorked [laughter] I hate to say in Pittsburgh favor but one of the things I think helped in this whole process as you described school ill\nIf it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had someone crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to lock arms with one another\nRight I mean a squirrel hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community um it's right next to\nIn ... and a lot of the people who live and scroll hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentists\nIt's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall is also um you know politically a liberal community and it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton in this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community as Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help in Pittsburgh favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the end of the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning\nI'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta just four months ago and attack or killed five reporters and Annapolis news written the capital Gazette\nSo you know I I Do think we have to worry about drawing the line um I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happens\nAnd from Decatur House in sandwich and assisted living community in a village setting committed to providing individualized attention for seniors and their families Decatur House family own for over Twenty years more information educator house dot com\nAnd from Marvin design gallery by mh see in Hyannis dedicated to bringing you peace of mind at home with Marvin windows and doors offering design installation and service Marvin by handmade C. dot com ... point one WBAI WC I.

the national weather service office out of the Boston Norton\nAnd can we talk to your earlier here on WC I Hope you are safe at the national weather service office\nOh yes we are okay what\nDo we had the quite as unique weather situation here this morning on the upper Cape and Martha's Vineyard [noise] and uh we understand the storm has ... has blown north toward New Hampshire and Maine is that the situation\nLet's say as we speak I'm looking at the current rate are um the storm that are brought a thunderstorm that moved over the upper ... the vineyard\nWith all its now heading over a Cape Cod bay a toward um the advocates\nOkay this is truly unique situation what happened exactly what did we experience\nOh well\nHad quite a cluster of thunder storms I'm moving up vineyard sound um with vivid lightning um we had issued a tornado warning on those storms cause it looked like they were kind of coming together and we also we're seeing rotation um\nAfter we issued a warning thank goodness we did a we have gotten some reports many of water spout sightings\nUh one of which came from the captain of the island home\nI'm part of the same ship authority he was actually leading ... on his way to Woods Hole and adding made that turn and was facing south west toward nah Sean island he got some good pictures of a water spout citing a additional\nOn Martha's Vineyard he saw some water spouse

silencing the people they abuse\nAmong other things some states are passing new laws that prohibit certain kinds of confidentiality agreements Zelda Perkins was an assistant to the Hollywood mobile and she says some of the current laws protect criminals Perkins left Weinstein's company Miramax back in Nineteen Ninety eight after a collie\nTo rape her last year Perkins broke her confidentiality agreement after about Twenty years of keeping her co worker secret here she is in an interview with the BBC\nI understand that known this guy's your claim that had the ... and ... the ... side um but it's really it's really important that legislation has changed around how these agreements and ... you cannot have an equal document that protect the criminal\nMany state lawmakers agree with ms Perkins this year in the wake up to meet you in times of movements Tennessee Vermont and Washington state among others pass laws banning certain kinds of confidentiality agreements other states including Maryland and California passed laws that expands sexual harassment protections to workers like freelancers\nIt's another example of states taking action while Congress makes promises and remains deadlocked\nToday we'll discuss these new state laws and what impact they could have workers and employees it's the final part of our special series this state were him where we've been focusing on the bills and initiatives that are trending in state capitals\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center the organization administers the time's up legal Defense Fund which assists with sexual harassment cases Emily welcome back to want to say\nThanks for having me joining us from the University of Oregon is Elizabeth tip it an associate professor at Oregon law school she's also a former employment lawyer Elizabeth welcome\nThanks for having me and Suzanne whole scene is the program director of the employment labor in retirement program at the national conference of state legislatures in Denver Suzanne thanks for making time for us\nYes thanks ... we'd also love to make time for you particularly if you've had experience with sexual harassment sexual abuse and felt like the law did or did not protect you if the law did not protect you in your state\nWhat went wrong or perhaps what did the laws in your state do write\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover and who don't become so when you look\nAt workplace sexual harassment lives um title seven as the federal law that says that you can't discriminate based on facts and that includes harassing people on the ... the facts but title seven only covers yeah\nPlease if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment laws\nShe was in ... in the number of states including from up to New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to more workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states are expanding protections and who they're covering\nYeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduced legislation in twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states or have introduced legislation as it relates to limiting or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or\nAnd enforced arbitration agreement so we've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York Tennessee California as you mentioned Vermont and Washington\nAnd other states are also looking at extending training requirements um so how many hours must uh employees are employers um require training and so we've seen legislation on that passed in um California is just one example of that\nElizabeth tipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws we heard from ... who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor\nShe says she could not report the incidents to a chart and as a contract worker she had no employer to sue\nI thought about it and I was like I don't want to post that on my social media it can change your reputation I really wish I could to protect myself in both situations are just I feel like I Would have had a sense of agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nFrustrated with how common is this for freelancers and Nina situation\nI Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive to provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws at all\nSo even basic protections ah like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaints system the employer\nHe knows the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nWere speaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law Susan whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures\nAnd Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I Love you to react to a comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am of Florida based graduate student at Boston University\nThis year ... required all students all staff and all faculty to complete a sexual assault training course I had no idea how many legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated\nWithout this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nEmily this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have passed laws expanding sexual harassment training and the education requirements for for some employers\nThat is true we have seen this share and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of workplace harassment which is exciting that there's been new creative\nUm will to bear thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on is\nRequiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there is no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected\nWhat sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior\nSo one of the things that I Hope comes from this long overdue attention she workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in the workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor to but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean there's a certain kinds of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment well when you think\nBallot could have a hand in drawing the new map

God ... dot edu\nBack now to our conversation about so called me to legislation trends in New state laws the name to strengthen protections against sexual harassment\nWas Emily Martin of the national Women's Law center Suzanne whole scene of the national conference of state legislatures\nAnd University of Oregon law school assistant professor associate professor Elizabeth tip it's we woke up some more of your questions and thoughts as well especially if the laws in your state that deal with sexual harassment sexual abuse worked for you or failed you we'd love to hear your story or even just your questions about the way these laws work\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one eighty or email won a a W. A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reactions to what we heard from California state senator ... and so I was like ... California is\nTrying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think I agree that California's\nBeen a real leader in the space both with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session as well as if you love that unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim\nYou know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that\nIs not enough time often for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action\nSo you know we joined the national Law Center joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week calling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think it's really a beacon\nFor other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their laws in meaningful ways\nMany states Emily that you're targeting in particular well I think\nOne of the things that we've seen this past year is that it's\nThey'll Tennessee a pass new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement that the condition of coming to work that would ah\nKeep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and so we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution\nSuzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and\nAnd I'm introduced a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that I did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that\nProvides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment of workplace and private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitation laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find that conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org vets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously I Wonder ... and if we can begin to the line of where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Dennis wrote on our Facebook page\nThere is a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however it is a disservice to our communities when they're used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\nYes well that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just called them contracts um or other types of agreements most of the legislation that we've seen us specifically says ...\nEli ban nondisclosure and great agreements and hold but just as it relates this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nProfessor typically before we move on to too much for there can you just define that term force what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do well\nThere's actually two types there's the type that you mentioned that people sign up to start over there and play meant that says keep our information confidential and that was another type of people find usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they've hired a lawyer\nAnd those are to settle the person's legal claims and those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct has occurred or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts on her line in the case\nFor someone who stick with you for a minute I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or helpful or hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you would have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there maybe some contradictions\nWith federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nFor the contracts that you sign at the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes clear that those can't cover a sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract\nThat keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that so the contracts and away educate the employees about their rights\nIt's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person is represented by a lawyer\nAnd I've heard plaintiff lawyers say that they like these provisions 'cause it's move the path toward the settlement\nAnd the thing that's kind of part about this is the people who maybe have the most interests and learning this information aren't at the table future effect and potential victims of harassment they don't have a say in whether the victim and the employer decided to keep the information secret\nWas because of some of your comments and questions Alex tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier luckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on emailed my girlfriend works for a call\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nCross state lines especially in Illinois and New York complicate the legalities that would otherwise helped bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on\nWell that's a great question if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond set our ally yes there can be complicated questions that arise if the person is usually employed and win state but the harassing or thoughts and behavior was in and out there\nBut it's important to remember that we're talking about state law stay in the ways in which states are going above and beyond federal protections there are core federal protections they should be strengthened in various ways that their core federal protections against workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment in schools and so that is a baseline that covers\nEverybody with the important exemptions that we've talked about that no matter you know what is it 'cause they live in\nA suicide I'd love to get your take on one of the states that did not pass at least one of its proposed\nBills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven
