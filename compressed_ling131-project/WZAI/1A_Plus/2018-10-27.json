to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also is is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping or countries like Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor they they as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nOn their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives in the United states they think that that children would have better lives and really there is no greater testament\nTo

as sources of great danger when in ... in fact a you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they are anything but\nAnd I also do want to point out a cartoon mentioned that President Trump\nAdmitted to the ... a A R mentioned that uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there's actually no evidence that points to the fact that they could be Middle Eastern but perhaps more importantly he was using um Middle Eastern as a slur of sorts which which\nWe ... we should we should just clarify\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live

East and\nI'm means you're dangerous that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at as Carlin was pointing out again a movement that happens very often a you know migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states\nAnd the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now numbering in the thousands is because it has been politicized here and the United states\nMichael Goldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful\nWith the language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments to
