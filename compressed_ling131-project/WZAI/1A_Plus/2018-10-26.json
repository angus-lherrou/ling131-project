still not ready to return to work [noise]\nUh of course a Charlie Rose Lee who was one of those\nWho are then found the buffalo\nOr in the summer in June and uh he's ... is the person who died Johnny

from hospital a several weeks before he was once again I think one can ... from that but to how to a lesser dosage\nAnd so I suppose you could say the most serious they affected person who survived will ... himself um when I interviewed the medical stuff their hospital you are you how to ... don't just even jokes\nThey was saying well ah we think that will be long term side effects bought the it's very hard for us to predict what may also I think one would still say that ... themselves and the prices of come with essence that's my understanding that they're all some long term effects but of course\nYou know if people are not a keen to discuss ah the specifics that are both because it's an issue of ... medical confidentiality and ah because I think there was still called little unknowns\nWith regard to Yulia ... daughter and I emailed it's often assumed in the media that his daughter was an accidental casualty however her fiance was a G R U employee whose mother was also a high level G R U operative\nWhen she tried to reach her fiance from the hospital he and his mother disappear also interesting and it goes on to write also interesting that the two alleged hit men flew on the same flight as the daughter to London\nConsidering that script his wife and son died earlier somewhat suddenly it seems that the poisoning when the daughter was visiting was not an accident the big question in my mind is this an operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level order mark\nI'm well I I'll just pick holding one little bits of Anna's a description that\nThe the two people are two suspects or did not flying on the same plane as you describe how they arrived the previous day as a different ... that week uh she arrived then on the science data sowed amounts at Heathrow a on a plane for most of it anyway and\nLet's just talk that ah that's just a detail um look there is definitely something ... about a half\nA rival in the u._k. and the timing of the attack I'm ... and right from the outset people I was speaking to were involved in in trying to work out what has happened investigated a believed that the timing was critical now we know even more so that the a suspect\nAnd being in the u._k. on exactly the same period the last few days of February\n... and the first couple of days in March during the previous year twenty six team\nOr a big problem twenty Seventeen and then another man who's been isolated or identified by Russian newspapers probably a pseudonym so gay few ... had been in the u._k. at the same time as ... or in twenty Seventeen\nAnd at the same time late February early March twenty sixteen now this raises questions about\nOr would they ... for some time where they using the fact that she lived in Russia and therefore they could attack a email account\nAnd that's been alleged by the u._k. government that they were hacking it from twenty ... woods and indeed him ... fun [noise] um she seems to have come back to be with her daddy Shia around that time because have bravo Sasha had his birthday on the first of march [noise]\nSo that's the ... uh by a light switch Seventeen I'm fortunate they tragically Sasha by the way had died but it's still supposed that she had come and twenty Eighteen to be with that at that time because it would be a difficult time because it was a time they were normally together as a family\nSo that the that it's always been um a a a line of inquiry for the investigators that the timing of the attack was critically linked\nTo use his arrival the or hiking or data emails and stuff which said show I'll come up from the apple is that your centers that Trump would help them to locate again make sure he was not a business trip when some of the way absent\nAnd uh that this would be a good time to do it now and I also mentioned a boyfriend that I'm\nUsually had bought a is a bit of a cab yet he's salt by some to have had connections with a one of the Russian intelligence agency thought he was not on the scene for example back in twenty sixteen\nWhen it's believed that this I'm like a a using the name so if it does have traveled to the u._k. he was not on the scene back in ... when we know according to the u._k. government that her email account was hacked\nOr he hadn't been on the scene so much more than a year so\nYou know we don't know and no fan of he's not here to defend himself against any allegations that he had played some\nBut we know that after the attack um [noise] uh well nearly among softer there was a ... hearing to do with medical procedures that to happen and it was ... that he had not been in touch with the hospital for example to find out how she was so the idea that he kind of a vanished from the scene seems to have some substance\nOr you just had access to the Internet since a fairly early on in a recovery we don't know whether she's reached out to him or whether indeed they often ... by\nA social media or messaging

confirms their already set beliefs\nHow do we break out of it since ... the people that those you\nAdam boy uh I don't know\nI think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now on the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms of civil discourse breaking down but a niece that very real trend are actual substantive policy disagreements between Americans differences in fundamental values\nThat are really really wide and were perhaps paper over for a lot of years by the media mano culture and now we're able to see them for what they are\nI Am personally kind of amazed that more political violence doesn't happen in the United states given the depths of these differences um I don't think it's just in how we talk\nAnd who we're talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing hears about fundamental differences in what we believe to be important in life and what we want government to do\n... we had fundamental differences forever in what we believe them but I think\nThis increase in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making the need is the enemy of the people has made a difference and I think that people don't generally talk to each other anymore there's not enough people that go up I mean I\nBecause of because I'm a report I talk to everybody but I Will ask people did you vote why did you vote who did you vote for people don't talk anymore they look at their phones and they are in their little bubble\nAnd Eugene I think it's important to note that and I don't know if you encounter this\nWorking for the Washington Post but certainly I Do on a program that's on NPR is that the people who comments on our show or not just our fans are critics\nListened to I mean I understand the idea about the division but if you hate NPR so much how do you know what we said on one age to criticize us if you made the Washington Post so much how do you know what was printed there to criticize\nYeah and quite frankly I think that that a behavior if exemplified most from the president himself who really hate CNN\nSeems to watch a lot of it um and it and I I'm blown away by how many people are are engaging us who don't want us to do what it is that we're doing and and it's unfortunate because I think we all need criticism or the media needs to be criticized so we need to be held accountable but we need to be criticized\nWe're going to keep moving from the story again just a quick caution as you listen to the coverage of this story over the weekend ... please just remember the stories moving really really fast\nWe're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions about what has happened there already been some details of the story that had been clarified or walk back so that's common in a fast moving breaking story like this keeping your on your NPR member station for the latest and an eye on NPR dot org a few more of your comments before we move on\nMatt emailed if Trump is responsible for the bombs are Democrats are responsible for the shooter at the Republicans baseball team practice both of these statements are untrue bleed mass referring to the the congressional baseball game in which Republican Congressman Steve ... beliefs of Louisiana was injured\nPhilip emailed the suspicious packages may have originated in Florida but the perpetrator or perpetrators tours are not necessarily based there\nThe Unabomber lived in Montana but traveled to Utah and the bay area to physically male his devices in order to deceive law enforcement All right let's keep moving on with some other stories and if the story continues to move\nIn the next few minutes we'll certainly let you know but let's talk a little bit more about politics particularly with President Trump\nHe was at a rally this week in Houston and he made headlines for a different set of remarks was [noise]\n[noise]\nThat wants to do well frankly not caring about our country so much [noise] and you know what we can [noise] you know that it's ...\nAnd really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nUsing Scott I Wonder if we can get to a clear definition of this term sheer what exactly is a nationalist I mean there's this ... is it typically consider to be what President Trump says it is\nAnd neither is global if I'm a according to President Trump to to be charitable or a mash and I mean it's it's just someone who put America First um\nBut the reality is anyone with a it's a historical context of nationalism knows that and it's a worldview embraced on other rising uh that has led to um you know genocide environments and separating people not like yourself or from a basis\nWe we deem a central and important to human beings um and so a truck you know early in his campaign I'm really distance himself from the ... the term nationalist when we saw a Steve Bannon associated with it primarily because uh they ... the form of nationalism that was most\nAre familiar with ah banning it in the ... community west that of white nationalism which we've seen um\nYou know sweep Europe and or even in hate groups in the states um and so it's it's been it's been deemed by most people would be problematic to see Trump embrace it I'm wild misrepresenting it\nOr put him on the receiving end up significant criticism\nAdam reduce the I'd love you to chime in on this I Know that you are a stickler and rightly so for precision in language and I wonder what your take is on the use of the word nationalist versus say patriots particularly because words like nationalist\nOften heard in in phrases like white nationalism global is has connotations of being anti Semitic give us parse the words parts of the language for us here\nI mean I think Eugene has already done a pretty good job of that I'm a I'm a little bit mystified by this whole story um the ... the idea that for President Trump to say hey I'm a nationalist is remarkable is kind of nuts to me um\nAmerica First his secondary campaign slogan is a perfect crystal ... of nationalism it's\nFor him to put a label on it is I think totally and consequential it would be like if President Trump got in front of a group of people and said hey my hair is kind of weird\nWill die we all know that um I suppose it's sort of remarkable that you said it but you know it's it's it's a truth that's right in front of us I think a lot of why the comment has gotten the attention is that yes I'm as Eugene said um nationalism has a really really bad track record in the twentieth century of leading the genocide\nI fell in love and I see adults would be that this woman and you know Seattle's a little bit different from New York the city is a city where nobody is trying to accomplish

community there's this ban on trans people serving in the military that's working its way through the courts\nOf reality start Caitlyn Jenner published an opinion piece this week in response to this proposed changing the definition of sex by age or just in the Washington Post she wrote quote\nThe reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president's the leader of our nation has shown no regard for an already marginalized and struggling community he has ignored our humanity he has insulted our dignity this is politics\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nRoom and being able to talk to them about trends issues I also had to push back on her a little bit because she knows that people in the room clearly do not want her there what do you make of her comment I mean she can't be surprised by the president's actions on this she just kept you know it's\nBeen really fascinating she uh is arguably one of the most visible transgender people in America and um has actually been criticized significantly by\nThe transgender rights community because uh she does not seem to be deeply informed about the political history that the community has been a fighting for the idea that she likes to be at the table almost implies that no one has tried to be at the table before her\nUm and and that the administration has been criticized by the broader community perhaps a for not being a a boat advocate of the trash under\nA community and and gender has been a critique for parents that have just noticed that one of the things I most fascinated by a I think this story right here reveals how\nPeople in different or identity groups can listen to the same candidate and walk away with different things in general and wrote in that Washington Post op ed\nThat she backed Trump because she heard him\nInclude algae beat see communities and has a speech at the Republican National convention she saw people applaud and so she thought he would have Vance algae beats he writes\nSocial conservatives voted for Trump because they believe he would reverse algae beats he writes a that perhaps went farther than they would have liked them to go and the Obama administration so it's just one of those amazing moments in about how different Americans here different things\nWhen he gets to a few of your comments before we keep moving Kirk emailed\nWhen was the meaning of gender changed to reflect the psychological state rather than a physical identity gender has always been a polite and more specific sending them for sex is routinely used as such on birth certificates it seems that we're talking about here is more accurately described as sexual identity rather than gender itself\nKirk I'll take this one on actually that's not correct your sexual identity has to do with attraction gender has to do was identity sexuality has to do with who you see yourself with\nGender has to do with who you see yourself as\nThe ... community today the remains of Matthew Shepard are settled in their final resting place at the Washington National cathedral\nShepherd was brutally murdered Twenty years ago in the act in October of Nineteen Ninety eight by men who targeted the Twenty one year old University of Wyoming students for being gay his death was a wakeup call for many Americans to violence against el GB teach people\nTo the ceremony drew hundreds to the cathedral for a musical event that included several of shepherds favorite songs including\nImagine by John Lennon\nLet's get to some more of your comments including about the refugee caravan and to be clear I think I misspoke earlier and said that the caravan as a possibility the caravans real the troop plan is real it is possible that the care of and might not get to the border by way of misspoke when I brought that up\nBryan emailed is this column of potential immigrants really such a big deal it's not like they're trying to sneak in they're coming up to knock on our door to ask for help sounds like they're following our rules\nAnd tweeted can we please start calling the care of and what it is a group of refugees fleeing communities destroyed by two thousand nine military coup with which the U.S out of hand I\nAlso want to acknowledge lots of you were commenting on this idea of nationalism let me read a few of your comments there irrepressible youth tweeted a quote from George Orwell nationalism is hunger for power tempered by self deception\nDaniel tweeted why did Trump used the word nationalist instead of saying he was an American\nAnd Matthew tweeted a match tweeted equating nationalism with white nationalism seems akin to the right rounding socialism up to ... both sides are talking past each other more and more and demonizing their political opponents\nLet's talk about economic policy the president made a statement to reporters this week that he will propose a new ten percent tax cuts for middle class the president was somewhat vague in his timing for this to happen but said that quote will do the vote after the election\nKathy Lohr I'd love to get your sense of what this means whether this was just something to say during the midterms or whether it seems that President really has a plan to continue making more tax cuts\nAnd this and I hate to say that but I don't think he has a plan [laughter] I think that it is I'm playing to his base maybe trying to expand its base because the original tax cut that he promised\nI don't think it helped middle class people as was promised the first time so maybe this is an effort to do so it's an effort to get ... voters out for this election\nI I don't think that we should even be talking about it on the news broke ground until there's something more substantive for us to talk about an actual policy there's everything about this is just so an serious I'm right now\nAnd I think that if anything that we are playing into the president's a political a gambit by even acknowledging the existence of a plan that isn't even a plan I mean to to to bring it back to what we were just discussing with the migrant caravan\nUm uh making its way through Central America this is another place where I think the way that we are talking about it is inherently a complicit in\nUm uh in reinforcing really unrealistic and politically craven view of what's happening I'm four thousand people marching from uh the northern triangle countries' interests uh bought them all and I'll Salvador um through Mexico hoping some of them hoping to reach the United states\nThis does not represent any kind of significant uptick in the number of people seeking refuge from these increasingly violent countries they just happen to be in a big group it's more a reflection of a change in strategy among people trying to make that journey whereas

President Trump sent troops to the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis is authorized deploying eight hundred more troops\nTo the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the the ...\n[noise] well it it really is as car ruined was pointing out apply of thoughts to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also is is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping or countries like Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor they they as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nOn their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives in the United states they think that that children would have better lives and really there is no great testament\nTo American soft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with their feet and come to the the the United states and settle\nAnd have children and have better lives of sensibly\nAnd and so the troops are part of this larger\nA Trump ... and I guess Republican rhetoric that play into the the idea that some migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as sources of great danger when in ... in fact a ... you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they are anything but\nAnd I also do want to point out a cartoon mentioned that President Trump a new to the ... a A R mentioned that uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there's actually no evidence that points to the fact that they could be Middle Eastern but perhaps more importantly he was using um Middle East\nWell I think we should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence said that there it's possible that mixed in with these thousands of migrants who were from Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know ... ... ferry is aimed for the country\n... and that's exactly right thank you for the car for vacation that but the the point I was getting too is that the use of the of of a Middle East and as the um it is extremely dangerous because it it it eight then tries to create the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at a car and was pointing out again a movement that happens very often a you know migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states\nAnd the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now numbering in the thousands is because it has been politicized here and the United states\nGoldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful\nWith the language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments to us about that with these this terminology including the use of the word and migrants\nMaria writes I Am Honduran I was born and raised in Honduras I came to the U.S to study and now I live and work here this quote unquote caravan is a cry for help cry of desperation from my people who will risk their lives to escape the extreme poverty and violence that I Know Israel\nThey are indeed refugees seeking refuge please don't blame them\nBlamed the corruption that has rotted the Honduran government and dug into Anthony tweet they are not migrants they are asylum seekers words matter\nNow Michael Merriam Webster is might go to in terms of use the English language\nMerriam Webster defines a migrant as one who migrate such as a person who moves regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops a refugee is one that fleas\nEspecially a person who flees to a foreign country or power to escape danger or persecution what do you make of the words that we're using to describe this\nIt doesn't fit anymore an old film pushing back against the one dimension analogy that black filmmakers have been fighting for decades and now it's getting a new life that next time on the take away from WNYC NPR I today at noon on double you ca I [noise]\nListening to W.

Michael Goldfarb with the first rough draft of history the host and creator of that podcast wrote me let me come to you though I Wonder what you think of the overall message of Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer to the data industrial complex which has been a phrase has been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex with the prison industrial complex what did you make of of cooks remarks\nThought these were really strong woods and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far
