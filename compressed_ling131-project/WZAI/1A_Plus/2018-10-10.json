A. M. U. dot org speaking of the world of work there's been some breaking news this morning about a woman who is choosing a new job and has resigned from our current position\nNikki Haley America's ambassador to the United nations announced her resignation this morning\nHe leaves formerly the governor of South Carolina has somewhat international reputation for being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on anything but it's on everything but since there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShe'll also be remembered in part for striking back at White House adviser Larry Kudlow who suggested she might have been confused regarding Russian sanctions she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get if you don't get confused\nShe and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his\nAlways say I can't say enough good things about Jared and Yvonne guy Jared is such a\nGenius that no one understands I mean to redo the NAFTA deal the way he did um what I've done working with him on the middle east peace plan it is so unbelievably well done and an office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the thing\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're a better country because they are in this administration I also just have to say I'm certainly thank you my family Michael at the same and um my two little ones I adore them entertain us un you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time and\nEnergy into it um but they have a lot of heart and\nReally wanted to make America proud and so with that I'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good flakes and um for the next Vassar to come in but now I don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was\nI was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand year flood or church shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then to come in\nAnd did years of Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to be self let's enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so\nThank you Mr President it's been a lot of\nMy time and I will say\nThis I'm for all of you that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can promise you what I'll be doing is campaigning for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president\nBut as Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations speaking just a few minutes ago at the White House announcing that she will be resigning from that post back now with our conversation with Renee brown and maybe by way of a transition\nWe should get through an email from Hillary who says I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed the work environment have you noticed a difference\nOh absolutely ... absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune from the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen\nIncreased polarization in our families in our neighborhoods among our friends is at work too and it feels dicey or at work um I think that\nPeople have to be careful um especially when there's power differential and it it's I\nOf anxiety at work and home\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of your other dividing line\nYeah cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nPolicy I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to kind of open up\nIf that alters toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just needs to be this one person I Do to keep my head down and get to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there and the minute that we start talking about emphasizing and being vulnerable and being urban and compassionate and knew\nThat opens the door for me to say something about how I voted\nOr you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love that's going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of less\nI think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I've never seen anything meaningful are significant come from mouth shut had down\nIn my career\nThat's just not how we make contributions and so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and\nRumble and we use the term rumble 'cause it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle it's a foundational skill set\nI don't think spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\n\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high and we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experiences all of who you are to address the problems\nFrom reading your book and based on the research that fueled the book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a scar yeah you know a scar is tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something tenders there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really it was actually voided my hypothesis\nJust it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at Jesse what I'm going to find but not in this case so we asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders that there is a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred and fifty sea level global leaders\nThree years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are and these were NBA and NBA students at Wharton catalog rice\nUniversity and then tons of data evaluation data so I thought when when when it was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need greater leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear\nBut then we went and talked to several daring leaders and said so you're not afraid very often and they were like\nWhat I'm afraid every\nDay I'm afraid all day long and I was like so that blew my hypothesis of fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to daring leadership is\nArmor it's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger the having to be the nowhere and get everything right instead of being the learner\nUm so really you know and it's interesting what you said about scars intend to places\nNot only does armor keep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear and less it faster and grow\nAnd metastasize so we need to create work cultures where armor is not rewarded or needed [noise]\nWe are some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left in our inbox first let's hear from Adam\nMy name is Adam Adam calling from Nashville, Tennessee I'm a paramedic and fire fighter and that was such a definitely feel like I Need to do my job perfectly at all times because there are definitely times one lives and livelihoods or on a lot of jobs\nOn the other hand I worked for a department that's very good about organism blues\nUm\n\nSupport for NPR comes from

P. in the app store\nAnd we'll share some of your stories on Monday when our series the state we're in continues on\nOne day back now to our conversation with Renee brown author of the new book dear to lead with regards to arm or Monday sold emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah any boundaries are actually a big part of this box of his batteries are incredibly important um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and so armor is not about\nProfessional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense in it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I meant to protect feeling good about myself\nOver moving our work forward to the difference between\nSo there's a difference between say armor an image such as kind of self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's it's on a more it's on a deeper level now\nIt's on a day but I mean the one of the greatest examples of armor the armored leadership versus their and leadership as one form of armor we see a lot and folks is\nI've got to be the ... and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting that right\nWe got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which racial power structures and broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace\nDisproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor ... tweeted\nAs a woman of color an immigrant and an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming that distrust well here's one of the\nBiggest findings I think is that one of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the last ... and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic and so that I mean racism\nHomophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nDesert desert everyday Thomas and it is real that ... that you know the armor that you need to survive those things Israel which is why it's leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender is another you know I I think the kind of\nAnita Hill criticisms that happen after the Ford testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during a way that we all got your\nDad who was you know but absolutely vulnerability can be used against us um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about\nValues and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some\nOf mission statement or vision clarification or posters everywhere saying this is we're supposed to be and then it's really worth nothing more than the paper on which is printed I work at some companies wind been to some companies where their values statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well why don't we start\nYou suggest that we should limit our core values to to yeah just to end the long list in the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list that I really ...\nWhy only two well here's the thing if you don't operation allies values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat poster\nI mean it really is [laughter] it's just really a poster so ... recording admired that little tone [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old said I Know it [laughter] you know and so\nWhat was so you know operation allies values into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with have actually done that had taken the time to say you know what a some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in\nAnd so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data\nThe men and women who had the capacity to be the most courageous could identify their values and they had two to three values and you know I have you know\nThere's a long list in the book like we talked about and there's probably Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nAltruism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independent self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to it my ... my two core values for me are facing courage and I know that the core values because it's a place where every other things on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we have a companion work buckets free downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operation allies and into behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we have our company values and that's actually how we assess you every quarter\nLoose on the values that you were to do it\nLike for example one of our values as take good care taking care of each other ourselves and the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean you either do it or you dumped and so I think it goes back to\nWhen you

S.\nUm what we see is President Trump not only you know\nEssentially questioning that the basic established of of climate change to undo existing\nClimate policies I'm President Trump had already moved forward with policies to undo regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants um undo or weekend um regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from cars\nActive to promote the use of coal I'm burning coal is one of the leading contributors to greenhouse gas emissions\nA President Trump wants to promote the use of coal in the U.S and abroad um one of the findings of this report is that in order to um limit greenhouse limit climate change to um\nYou know to to to the sort of least destructive um level of warming\nUm the use of coal will have to uh basically go down to zero I'm by by twenty fifty ... basically\nNo more on just about no more coal and and and and it is you know that that it that is an extremely disruptive policy recommendation um there's no question that there are industries and people who will be harmed\nWho who will have their livelihoods disrupted by policies um they go in that direction\nAnd and that's just once I started to shore call but I Wonder in terms of the politics behind this and I hear you on I I totally hear you on how disruptive this has its own like coal is so interwoven in the network of America's energy grits kind of hard to just yank it all out\nI Wonder though in terms of the voices on the world stage who\nWe we know that there are voices who were saying well coal it'd be really hard to pull out do you get the sense of there's anyone in the world stage saying tough\nOur planet is only home you light pole tough we got to get rid of it deal with how old you are traveling through so Jerry Brown the governor of California for\nYeah and many of the ... on on the president of France has sought to kind of a step in and um he he's trying to carve out a place for himself as a as a leader on climate change it's it's not difficult for France to take that position because France um doesn't really use coal\nUm so but but but we I mean we absolutely see world leaders saying you know this is what what needs to happen um\n[noise] in China it's very interesting because um China is the world's largest\nUm greenhouse gas polluter and is a massive user of coal at the same time we're off the the the Chinese government has moved forward with I'm actually in acting um prices on carbon ah they're they're they're an acting a cap and trade system that would force\nUm carbon polluters called polluters to essentially pay attacks or if the um in in order to\nGet away from from greenhouse gas has an idea that was invented in the United states is I'm considered sort of politically toxic here in China they can implement it by ... they don't have to deal with that Congress voting against at Iraq and in the United states\nKind of doing it I Want to talk more about that idea of carbon taxes we continue in just a moment but let me get to a few more comments or Brian emailed\nWe have no leaders anymore with the skills or courage to do what's right regardless of the political cost we will keep polluting as long as the price of fossil fuels is low would be interested to hear from some of you listening who you trust who you think some of the leaders are politically in this country around the world\nWho you believe are sincere in their push to do something significant about climate change their anybody that you think is for real and saying that we're going to make this happen or maybe if you were active with\nA politician or a government leader or a government agency that's doing something tangible\nYou feel people should know more about we'd love to hear from you what gives you hope that climate change is something that is actively being worked on where you are email is one a at W.

trying to make an impact with the fight against climate change here is a little mash up of two of the messages we got this is Amy from Chesapeake and Jeff in Michigan listen\nI'm getting ... thoughts feeling of power and that I caught the tail enough to stop the way round\nI pessimism comes because I Believe that what's happening to the world is happening at a corporate level and I'm Still more companies get on board and care about the environment it feels like we're kind of inevitable path and\nTwo thousand for it or you will be here before we know it and we will reap the consequences\nThanks Geoff an Emmy for sharing your thoughts with us ah speaking of the corporate path there are some corporations who\nAre taking a position in the fight against climate change including with regards to the carbon tax Melissa tweeted China uses more than twice as much coal as the U.S hard to believe some carbon tax is going to make much of a difference considering their population let's talk more about carbon taxes with one more of our guests joining us from London\nTed holstead is the chairman and CEO of the climate leadership council Ted welcome to want\nTo a [noise] good to be with you ... what is the climate leadership council [noise]\nIt is a group a that is co founded by a by actually the brought us climate coalition in us history tobacco national solution is pushing for a carbon tax or all the money is related to the American people in the form of ... of ... of a dividend\nWho were some of the backers of the council where does the funding come from\nSo um the council is a does not accept corporate contributions but our founding members include four of the\nAh oil majors the largest car manufacturer in the United states the largest utility but also the largest\nUm solar company in the United states a very broad coalition it also includes two leading environmental groups and opinion leaders from across the political spectrum ranging from\nBen Bernanke key to Janet Yellen to Larry Summers and of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker and George Schultz the Baker's shoulder\nThe fight we have there is a separate spin off organization that as a lobbying organization and that now has corporate funding including from Exxon okay\nAnd that is connected to the organization or use it as a spin off but it's still a connection in any way or completely separate\nUh it is a separate organization that is the advocacy arm of the climate leadership council so the council develops this groundbreaking breaking plan were all sides wind and Americans for carbon dividends which was co chaired by\nFormer Republican Senate majority leader trend lot and uh uh sooner bro that group lobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power interests\nColder report let's take a step back before we get into the plan that the climate leadership council is advocating more specifically defined this term carbon tax for us what exactly is a carbon tax\nShore so um [noise] the idea of a carbon tax is um\n... each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere um you can put a price on how much economic harm it causes I'm\nAnd I'm In ... and ... and important note on that as the the economist who came up with with that idea his name is William North house he's a professor at Yale I'm was just awarded the Nobel Prize for this idea on Monday\nI'm the same day that the IPC came out with this report which heavily sites I'm professor north houses work\nUm so he came up with the idea of every ton of carbon um traps heat in the atmosphere and you can put a price on how much\nEach kind of carbon hurts a the global economy um and and there's a range for how much that costs that it it can range from um fifty dollars a time to a hundred dollars a time when I'm you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost that once you sort of place that price on carbon um than you are can essentially um create attacks I'm\nAt a price on carbon or attacks on carbon that you would impose upon polluters of carbon dioxide no no\nNo carbon Muslims are cool I just want to be really clear in terms of who the taxes paid on I mean if I Am a car maker do I pay the what we're talking with pollution from automobiles\nCarbon tax for producing the vehicle that belching out carbon dioxide or does the oil company pay the carbon tax for finding the gas alone to turn ...\nMost likely you pay at a as a car driver I'm okay\nAnd and and and you you would so um we don't have carbon taxes in the U. S. um so in some ways this this is sort of um\nYou know and intellectual debate although other countries are are are working are sort of further along on this but the idea is um if this would affect how you drive it would probably um be taxed based on how much carbon monoxide would be a produced by burning\n'em by burning gasoline show it would most likely be added to the cost of the gasoline that you put in your car so if you're going to put in\nAnd it mounted gasoline in your car that would produce a certain amount of carbon dioxide when you burn it that would raise that tax would raise the price of gasoline and the idea is then you would be motivated to buy a car that use less gasoline essentially that that's how it would\nDrive the market so consumers would want to buy electric cars would want to buy efficient cars not because not out of some sort of\nA moral sensibility but because actually up at a price on carbon would make it cheaper to use an electric car it's a it's a powerful market signal\nTo hosted the yesterday Exxon Mobil committed money to lobbying Congress for a price on carbon give us a sense of what the plant involves and why it's getting support now\n[noise] so um the bigger shields carbon difference plan is based on four pillars of the first is a robust carbon tax starting at forty dollars per ton which would actually be the highest carbon tax of any a leading emitting country\nAll of the money would go directly back to the American people in the form of a carbon dividend\nWhich means that the vast majority of American families including the most vulnerable would win economically from this plan and a third pillar is that we would trade a high price on carbon in a growing price on carbon\nFor some of the carbon regulation simply because a carbon tax is a more cost effective way to solve climate change\nLaws wanna make sure I understand so the plan if the plan went into effect there would be a tax on the carbon that I Am it with my car or my motorcycle or whatever and then the the revenues from attacks would come back to me as a taxpayer in the form of dividends\nA family of four would get approximately two thousand dollars per year\nIn dividends and here's how the system would work the more you pollute the more you pay the less you pollute the more you win so Seventy percent of American families would come out economically ahead and that's what's so transformative about the dividend concept which is that we can have\nThe most effective climate lever which is a carbon tax in a manner that is popular populist and equitable for the American people\nHow much of that money would be spent on environmental programs are planting forests or doing research on cleaner energy with all of it just come back to us as taxpayers\nA hundred percent would go back to the American people and that is what makes the plan a popular\nAnd politically viable because in ... on Capitol Hill you'll never get the two sides to agree on how to spend the revenue Republicans will say well let's spend on deficit reduction are lowering the corporate income tax Democrats will say well\nTo be up to sell some delightful as you'll have to roasted uh let let kicking around for two or three weeks or even a couple of months and maybe it's secret from the floor and that might be a little like ...\nYou're listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations\nAnd you're listening to WBAI your local news and information storage medicate the ... and the island Ninety point one dead in the eye and WBAI aged ... would tell my does maybe Ninety One point one W.

you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it but I loved it for entertainment value but my big pieces that moment when he brought her onstage and knowing that was not her ... down knowing what she can hold that she wasn't going to be good enough\nThat no one would care that no the find her interesting or attractive and she just went out and she killed it and they loved it and for that has second ac that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her\nHe's been afraid to put yourself out there for the same reasons\nIs kind of a big moment yeah I I I hear you on that just does that resonate for you in a way like was there something personal that that made you flash back to er sad about for a lay\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know I Do a lot of things where I have to go out in front of crowd or in front of people and you often hear you know ... dinner or project lower or beat this or that are younger and at that moment with kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that moment that we can personalize it whether it's in an interview or\nWhat have you and I think that was an important early\nHeather what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her no\nYes yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she's like this is my name is all me to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and I thought it it kind of an ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that Ali billboard and he says we should just be bold billboard your nose\nI think the thing about the comments about her nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand and one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist in and thrive\nIn Hollywood as far as it coming on the music industry it absolutely is a powerful comment on the music industry as the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing has placed in time where this movie is a place in time it's interesting to think about that\nBecause almost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's really no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming playlists and um the major record labels having less\nPower than they used to so it's almost like old fashioned and its view of the music industry but only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle\nA the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also chime in but by the way for those who have not seen star is born\nA recession she tells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose you know just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go into homes I Wonder how you view the commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie I felt\nLike I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink\nWho's very much and invention of pop music but who also have this kind of rye cynical style style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways is very linear it's a very linear idea of there is the one I'm rose to fame there is one pass you just simply offend or descend as opposed to\nThere's no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWithout kind of going through that traditional path so agree with Anna about that but I think that um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them pass each other\nOn this fame ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about Lady Gaga you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist like Lady Gaga who has been so able\nTo make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean the funny thing about this movie is she is way more important to culture than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from you know Bradley Cooper without a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd and that way\nYeah except for the voice in rocket and guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean\nMan actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley send a lot of time sitting up that first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga character alley is just improvising a love song\nAnd they found\nTime to time can do that\nTo [noise]\n\nPretty good Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga in a star is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano and sang and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we sang together I mean everything's ... we say we sing everything live in the movie wow yeah there's nothing we're not lips thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's seen next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in a scene is actors fully believing that you're the character you can't not believe it yourself so she really gave me that confidence\nBradley Cooper speaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration between Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga particularly how it came out in the way the love story played out\nThis is my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meets jak he is a stumbling blackout drunk and I think it looks as if he's just spend a weekend at a bar do cabin or oh Kavanaugh K gr\nSupport comes from you and from

meeting of the one movie club with and powers Linda Holmes and John horn let's get to a few more of your calls now gene is listening in Indianapolis hey gene what did you think of a star is born\nEnergy and can you hear me yes I have a five stars which why five stars [noise]\nUm actually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one seem particularly well updated to today um I thought it was the the irony of her being discovered\nBecause he was a drunk and looking for a drink\nAnd their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was the continuing thing and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent I guess he was her agent uh the guy who made her over\nThe manager do agent played yeah what what is your main character\nI didn't like him and I I guess I wasn't supposed to\nBut ah the minute he had that conversation with jacks and um and and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him of being a problem in that whole relationship\nI just I just knew that that was going to be the start of of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear Eugene a hundred percent of ... and I I figure I heard your charming and as well\nNo that was male nominees go ahead yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of this story one of the tricks with the manager and I think they do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is\nI'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them from the beginning um\nBut then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so I think the manager\nIt seems like a forced element that\nIt doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed it because when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate and a lot of different ways for sure but\nYou know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough to drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was\nI agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell and there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on said to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way from like\n... ... exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of that the narrative issue with the ending\nLet's all go ahead and go ahead\nWell of course of course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine or the fame monster as like the guy got what's called ... and one of her album ah destroys people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of star is born in there and in fact all the bridges of the SARS going to have that manager character in a different embodiment um that character in this film I\nAbsolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in and some of the previous versions he almost was a sympathetic enabler um of of the male lead and who then\nWas like hey you know we're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name of alley or in the stars foreign versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people\nA stand in for the machine be part of the part of the cast you know has to be there um\nI also just want to say before we end got to get this out there that um\nThis is also the story of how\nA woman's arise leads to a man's fall [laughter] and that's an internal problem with the SARS bar and you know it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nA toward the lead female character but there is this underlying sense has to say it that\nEven as Jackson, Maine is saves temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from his young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushed the periphery\nFeminist rating problematic found well\nBut you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a feeling male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era\nYou get to a few more of your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars\nI deeply appreciative ... new wants to shyness in her early portrayal which made main characters advising her work well I'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance\nIs seen seen the little too detached from me overall I Love the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from Argo in ... North Carolina who tweeted three stars a star is born was a story the performances especially the musical ones were fantastic and the cinematography was incredible\nI expect a lot of nominations to come for deep ie the director of photography the cinematographer Matthew ...\nProduction designer Karen Murphy costumer Aaron been a score original song and editing John horn spoke with the cinematographer Matthew ... about shooting live performances which are not really straightforward space to navigate here as a part of that conversation from the PC sees the frame\nThis film was very difficult to sort of navigate the stage performances because we had three different modes basically we had the Coachella mode which is I'm borrowing stages or that were already set up\nAnd putting in our own crowds and then there was the I'm running guns sort of we have ten minutes to shoot in between two sets with a real audience apologizing in thanking the audience for I'm sort of I'm shooting a movie in between\nTwo bands and then we had the third which is the Greek theater which in which shallow was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie fashioned was able to a great the Greek theater as a set and put a certain amount of crowded and so that was my most controlled\nUm scenario but the lighting of it had to have a consistency might my goal was that um you know in creating a a character from sin cinematography standpoint Jackson, Maine might as well be um\n[noise] oh I don't know Jack White and I had to make sure that the ... the audience maybe subconsciously filled the this is his lady [noise] this is his road show and it's also in the film in the sort of visual movement of it all representation of rock and roll\nThat was a mask you seek the cinematographer on a star is born speaking to John horn on Cape he sees the frame John can you talk a little bit more about the making of this film particularly back to Kathleen ths question who wrote on Facebook how you can tell if a film is a well directed this kind of a film", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "10"}
