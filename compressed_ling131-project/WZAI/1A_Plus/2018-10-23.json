that means it's time for a special series ahead of the midterms called the state we're in\nThis week we're looking at state trends in laws on unions involving the public sector workforce like teachers firefighters and government employees they make up one of the most heavily unionized sectors of America's workforce\nBack in June the Supreme Court passed a ruling that could make it harder for unions to secure a labor contracts through a process known as a collective bargaining the ruling affects more than twenty states and the consensus is it the decision will hurt unions financially and could lead to a further decline in membership\nAhead of that ruling some blue states took steps to protect organized labor\nWhat impact will all of this have on the labor movement\nAnd what impact does it having on election season\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Scott Greenberger executive editor of state lie\nA journalism project of the Pew Charitable trusts Scott welcome back to what ...

W. A. M. U. dot org\nSarah there was one more thing I did want to ask you before\nWe had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners about their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in granted I Can't think of any union to make all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nI'm a member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things that union negotiations for us on our athletes\nAll that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent the higher level Caesar accountability that will ultimately lead to higher salaries more competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers would you\nSend your that negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition in the market and ultimately compare ourselves through other business areas where\nCompetition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with Sarah I'm Wondering what you think of John's commented does he have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and I'd like to make a couple of comments about that um first off I've not always been happy with everything that mining and has done but one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers the union is not just your union leaders\nUnion movements are driven by numbers and lenders and need to demand and you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices\nUm it's actually not that difficult to fire a teacher but what unions has done is made it clear that\nCan't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe then you have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or you know and part of the reason that so important is because\nTeachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they\nMake higher salaries and you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore let you go see her I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates in trying to work with the other delegates about improving policies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think the residents of your state\nOr really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated than I Wonder if it would have taken the strike to make things happen in West Virginia\nI think that they are motivated and I do believe that that is why the strike was so successful we could not have done what we did without the support of our communities and I think that our community is real\nHe has this strike was just it out hey are just about healthcare it's not about that\nNot just about that it's about creating conditions for students for teachers for families and for working people in general and I ... with my own eyes legislators are pitted leap putting the entrance it outside corporate interests over their own people in this state and that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate Jamaican time forest thanks very much thank you\nWithout a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed\nI don't think workers should be forced to join a union but I also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts non union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fair equitable enough unions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers Scott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland comment about non union members\nGoing it alone and individually negotiating just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want but a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions right\nI Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of variation from state to state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um uh uh differences that you were talking about\nI Know someone that we should put that question to boys think is an expert on down in ... and she's joining us with them and when I see in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U.S Randy welcome to want to say hey\nJoshua and that Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members and I she's running and un bury a pill district and I hope she makes it for another three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to you a little bit more about that in a moment I should also union contract I actually I don't really contracts I said also introduce Vincent ... he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\n[noise] hey thank you for having me on principle if I was gives me Randy before we continue\nGoing it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is a floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA is to save these or at least the minimum working conditions and wages right well\nUm it's in in some in some industries it's a floor now the ceiling\nIt depends on what the clause is about ... city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes it's for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay good that's that's that's a good con ... ... a context for folks maybe who never been in a union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage may vary Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the Janice case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house so\nWell that's right but before we get to that let's just go back and to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country\nAll right to work all Janice means is that a union can get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect collective bargaining in any other way unions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions\nAnything they could before right to work before ...\nThey can negotiate for after it except for the ability to say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired\nAnd going back to that contract is a a floor and not a sale like uh the vast majority of collective bargaining agreements especially those in the public sector\nHave seniority built in are the only way to get a raise is by logging another your other job can I um am all the way to go ahead and finish off um so I I I actually agree with Bill um you know workers should have the ability to negotiate individually if they want to the Mackinac center has model legislation it's called the workers choice\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Fidel investment\nClients' grow preserve and manage their wealth\nMore at ... dot com slash wealth fidelity record

A. M. user station they care about and so they choose to give and so the barometer we have\nOf whether we're doing what people want is their willingness to become members to become sustaining members to give to write a Sims or wills to donate their cars to be you know cash out to to support the station\nIt feels like a similar argument with folks and right to work states where they say if unions are doing what they are members want them to do you don't have to compel them to pay their dues they will pay gladly because they'll know what they're getting from the union they can't get on their own it's absolutely essential what's wrong with it\nFrankly the arguments a moot point that Janice case has ... has decided\nThat you know everything is completely voluntary the argument used to be this that if you are creating a staff and I'm an entity that is a bargaining contracts and representing all of everyone\nThen it shouldn't just be the people with the loudest voices\nIf they get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention and that just like in terms of taxes to the United states of America or to\n'em or or bar association fees or student loans the or student organization fees that when you have an obligation to serve all\nThat all pay a fair share and that was the argument that actually had a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in the booth case\nAbout forty five years ago and six successive Supreme Court rulings that affirmed it\nTo the gym is overturned\nExactly so but look Janice that Alito Sam Alito judge of the Supreme Court has wanted this case has asked for this case for years most people thought it was it a a logically base because the issue was really on the outside that that the the case that the Mackinac center I Wish they were being more honest about it\nThat the Mackinac center that Donald Trump that others made was that you know the Democratic party used unions as their foot soldiers so let's defund unions that had really nothing to do with other kinds of things and therefore they want us to defend us however the cases done\nAnd what has happened since is that members have stuck with unions and and and and and Vincent said something else which I think was or Scott which I think I just want to raise which is that the Mackinac center\nActually violated all sorts of school board policy and all sorts of norms and laws by the day after the genocide case sending an email on school email to ... to virtually every single teacher in ten states if we we if we had done that\nPeople would be flapping us around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside of school and what we've tried to do is basically say to to the states just give us some time so we can introduce people to the union\nAddress what are you a drink and a chance to respond to them then we'll keep moving by the way it is worth knowing that the Mackinac center did file a friend of the court brief in the ...\nTo respond well hey thank you and you know there's groups across the country that are communicating with public employees to tell them about their rights mackinaw has there might pay my said dot com website I'm In Ohio to go back to your previous caller there's the workers choose dot org website\nAnd these efforts are needed because unions like Randy's are trying to trap public employees into paying them or trying to limit the time that they can exercise their rights under jazz\nUm in some cases in credibly confusing time periods or in some cases only about a week also that\nUm states like New York New Jersey California give unions the ability to essentially have captive audience meetings or make their sales pitch to a public employees while at the same time forbidding anybody else from talking to that our employees and this is during the work\nDay week ... ... what you mean by captive audience meanings what what exactly are you referring to [noise] um well\nRecent legislation passed in several states gives unions the ability to do what they call a orientation sessions with a with new employees so basically think it's time share presentation on steroids where the union can come and\nNew you're listening to your local news and information source for the Cape the coast in the islands nutty point one WC I WC a young age the one we're told Martha's Vineyard [noise] Ninety One point one W.

Gorbachev here is President Reagan at that meeting in Nineteen eighty seven\nThe importance of this treaty transcends numbers we have listened to the wisdom of in an old Russian maxim and I'm sure you're familiar with much Mr general secretary though my pronunciation may give you a difficulty\nThe maximum is do vi no pro vi trust but verify [noise]\nMuch you can answer this issue with\nThe pattern every meeting [noise] from the meaning\nOf Nineteen eighty seven between Ronald Reagan and Rick how Gorbachev give us a sense of the leadership styles of Reagan and Gorbachev that allowed this treaty to come to fruition\nWell when you think of Ronald Reagan or you think of a man who is extremely decent\nAnd a conservative Republican incompetent he was just a very competent person\nOr when you think of ... a Gorbachev he was a communist uh but overall a decent person who wanted to do something at that time they were both very different from the president we have now Joshua or in the sense that um [noise]\nYou know when I was in government\nUh mothers and fathers wanted their kids to grow up like Ronald Reagan maybe not the policies maybe they didn't agree with the policies but the decency of demand the humble miss the man the genuine niceness of him and today even if you're agreeing with Trump's policies which I don't\nBut even if you do I don't think any mother father wants their kid to grow up to be like a Donald Trump or this\nIs probably sorry are probably some who see and openly quality and the president or they're hard to say\nThough there will disguise Joshua and or the decency the kindness of Reagan who really loved immigrants and his office was decorated with pictures of immigrants his farewell address to the country talked about the wonders of wonderful immigrants coming to our country\nIs a whole address was about immigration how wonderful it was\nHe was a fanatic about a free trade or not having tariffs at any time and he was very intense it's dry reduce government spending and reduce especially the deficit all those things were\nClassic conservative classic Republican and um none of them are being\nPublic and I'm Donald Trump but anyway the style of Reagan was a style that made somebody like me very proud to serve him and very proud to be there with him on that weekend in Reykjavik in Ninety six\n... author of Reagan had Reykjavik forty eight hours it ended the Cold War also the arms control director for President Reagan and former U.S ambassador to the UN ambassador ... thanks for talking to us okay now learn how to spell recommend an extra what I'll work on it I think very much very got back [noise]\nWhat two Confederate General Robert e and the Reverend Dr Martin Luther king junior have in common\nAccording to retired General Stanley McChrystal they are both leaders worth studying granted we study them for very different reasons but they did some of the same things\nThey made bold decisions that won them loyal following they were controversial within the very leadership structures that brought them into power and they are revered today for what they represented not just what they accomplished\nStill these men with several things in common which seemed to have almost nothing in common\nPerhaps that's the paradox of leadership there is no one formula and no one checklist that defines\nAll leaders Stanley McChrystal retired as a four star general he served as the top us commander in Afghanistan from two thousand nine twenty ten and he's the co author of the new book leaders missed and reality alongside Jeff Eggers and Jason men go and he joins us to discuss it General McChrystal welcome to one day\nIt's another busier Joshua we also like to take your questions in thoughts for the general about the nature of leadership and we'd love to know to some of the leaders are that you look to that you try to emulate or is that you follow whose leadership attributes you think are worth highlighting\nOutlook our weekly highlight of upcoming arts and culture then every Wednesday afternoon on all things considered Thursday MORNING EDITION beds to weaken outlaw from WBAI it will help you make sure you don't get out on what's going on\n[laughter]\nSupport comes from you and from the valley group a family owned residential construction company committed to the community and aircraft for over Twenty years the valley group starts with a handshake ends with a hug more at V.

A. M. U. dot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage I ... I recall some people using the word leader\nAnd some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted if a quote unquote leader fails to leave but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear are they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nThink that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in roles and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said or effective or not because\nYou can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler\nIf we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous\nWe think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders the dad retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then the short conversation he just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way\nHe made me feel better I think we want our leaders to make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubbed your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who's a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent\nWho pushes you to be better than you would otherwise be the military commander who works you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way\nBut at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that\nYeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot\nTo us and and if we we frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say are we demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask when so many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through them one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textual right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors\nAnd their leader can use them and on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context has changed the followers are in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team in the situation\nThe second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them\nWe use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe it what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and I thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy because I was there and I would therefore be the star\nBut when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome and therefore thought I should get credit or blame for that but I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that are played upon that\nWhen I concluded with the leaders still part of it I mean I was still like keep part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on the leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are the all the other things in the situation\nOr putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the leader of caused the great thing to happen or is ultimately responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nAlthough I Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the silly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven tour so he kind of you kind of wanted it that way\nIt's very common I mean if you think about it every body a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she did an extraordinary job of pushing his team to create at a masterpiece he wanted the basket and that and it ...\nPlus tips huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWas speaking to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York the co author of leaders miss and reality that third myth you call the results myth which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter will results\nMatter and we claim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality\nThe data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures or their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in us and emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results than we think we are\nMarjorie

A. M. U. dot org Anthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from that\nOh so I've had a a quaint and ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and now in times past than [noise]\nYou say what a threatened to run it threatened to run yeah LA's either run for president are are going to support Romney 'cause you know I decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there is something a little short of about the word threatened not he floated the idea or he hinted at a rally threatened\nYeah that's a go go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run and that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president but sort of like that sort of a threat but uh\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person as a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature of the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your a bottle you know so for me um I Love coming on NPR all go on the left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews\nBecause I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said that he spent a lot of time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side and that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way\nIf I got to the other side and weaken my argument that I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from well\nAnd there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press as a communications director where you tried to convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you've said that\nIt it pushes back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive\nI hear you on that but the president didn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nYeah no no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know like if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there\nAnd they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so having the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody leaked it so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press\nAnd servicing all parts of the press who didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything I only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call on CNN they had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I want to send a message to those people that have we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business uh and you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I build my own business and you know came from scratch so\nI find in the square ought to I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening\nIs there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted previous and Bannon out of there I made it very big gaffe when he put Kelly in the job\nIt was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president and even if I accepted a subordinate role which I have would have been happy to do with um a team player\nI don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality or does that strike you as somebody that General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ...\nHaving you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for it and I don't even beyond beyond that\nBut as far as like me anymore and then he likes the price on your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press she could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean\nI get the sense that the president just\nDidn't agree with it [noise] um no\nActually no such thing as where there's a funny story you know 'cause you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I'd been announces ... over a Gemini alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and says hey that's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's going so poorly in the first six months\nI look at what you declared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media for going to lose that war\nAnd that that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well you way better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president is a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him but for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism\nLet him parity with allegedly stall let him have a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had him in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people that don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president so there was a lot of people inside of calm seem like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like ... and him telling these\nStories that on average ... maybe a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm On my inaccurately and and clearly in consistently over ... listen I just left a morning show where these guys like but they\nThey really want them all day and night and so and they're calling them a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that and I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want\nAll that stuff to be dial down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to so so but but we have to do then is you got to tell 'em straight yesterday man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he'll say back to you as well it's energizing my base it's bringing people out to

one eighty million dollars in a lottery before we bring in a few more of our guests and get more from Sally let me get to a few of your\nComments in terms of what you would do if you won the lottery Steven wrote on our Facebook page I'd check off every vice I've ever dreamed about\nNatalie wrote on our Facebook page I'll never win because I don't gamble no lottery for me and Jim wrote on our Facebook page I'll take my chances with finding out if I can handle the wealth or not Sally as love you to respond to gyms comment in terms of finding out if you can handle the wealth once the money\nHow did they handle it [laughter] that's a great question and I'm I'm going to agree with him I'm not gonna lie everything that you know even if I say something negative about the wind today I have got get ally of such a hypocrite yes we have a ticket for tonight's drawing\nHuh one voyeuristic though you\nKnow wait a minute wait a minute you already won the wind blowing up a million or if you win the lottery you do when was\nIt was it may it it it's interesting because you know what\nPeople here eighty million you know\nI never realized how much it decreases like if you take the cash option then Uncle Sam had hands out like\nI Need Fifteen times in the first year it just it really dwindle deal no please don't get me wrong my down then choose or not to\nTie and all that but uh [laughter] you know but I Will\nSay that you know it it I'm not gonna lie and say that it was a complete cars for my family and when I say my family I'm going to talk about my husband and my\nTwo daughters so in so many ways it was a blessing because our parents did share a small portion with my brother and I you know that means that my kids can literally choose any\nPrimary and secondary education gold I won't let you go to any school for any amount of time they can do anything they want if you want to travel to Italy to study architecture because that your dream\nDo it you know and that's an absolute blast that my husband and I both being and solve for sales we would have been able to afford that anyway but it's nice to have that cushion right\nUm so there are blessings but I Will say that women has shown me personally the absolute dark side of human nature and you know it wasn't my women but I have absolutely experienced it I'm sure my parents you know would have many many more storage 'em and\nYou're in speaking about my parents it it's strained relationship you know I've chosen to become extremely private about this women you know my husband and I moved to a different town to just kind of get away\n[noise] because my parents one and a state where you cannot remain anonymous and for them that with habits because they love to brag about it they loved the lab actually like it like look at me where I'm more of the exact opposite and some of that is just out of fear either I'm I'm kind of\nFear based anyway do you worry about\nYeah it's a ransom way up here at someone hitting them over the head making sure everyone stays home and\nI Know I don't know I I Know we've got to move on in in just a moment but I Wonder how you reflect back on that if you could go back to whatever the store was where your parents bought that winning ticket and say something to them before they bought it what what would you say\nIt would be the same thing that I Would tell\nAnyone who won tonight or if you won two million dollars each one two billion dollars that doesn't matter I think it it's they absolutely need to have the typical advice that you hear you know surround yourself with a great tape a CPA a financial advisor at attorney\nBut my big advice would be to be careful\nThese are not necessarily the people that you went to high school with offices in a strip mall are handled your last divorced or whatever you know you've had yeah the scale of your new state has to match their ability to start ... and you know\nIf you can't remain anonymous\nConsider options that allows you to remain as it not um ss as possible and then you control\nThe message out you know I I Know that there are ways to do it and I think the last one is to just be aware of people's actions no matter how subtle you've gotta create your own litmus test who becomes your tried right right not your close family and it's not your ...\nI really do appreciate you sharing your story with us despite your decision to remain anonymous Sally we'll call you but certainly we appreciate your sharing that with his thanks very much for talking to us\nThank you good luck to everyone with a ticket including us\nTonight [laughter] we did hear from some of you who have won some lotteries in the past although I still like my rule if you win more she came when twice but DJ in San Diego did win the lottery DJ emailed\nNot a big win but we want twenty six thousand dollars from the California Supreme auto plus some years ago got all five numbers but not the all important mega number we netted Nineteen point two thousand on one hand it was probably awash with all the money spent on the slips purchased in the years previous to that when\nOn the other hand the Nineteen point two K. was going on a hot minute people came out of the woodwork our shirt tales grew long\nThe only thing I can remember is the purchase of our first flat screen TV and that went in the divorce

jackpot to grow this high I mean I I Am I've heard that one point six billion is the all time record is that right\nWell one point six billion the all time record but it only eclipses the previous record which happened back in January of two thousand and sixteen or buy a just a small amount the last record was almost one point five nine\nBillion dollars but just to give your listeners an idea of how big new says if you pick the cash option\nAnd you invested in a relatively secure bonds the amount of interest you would get after taxes would be about a hundred thousand dollars per day\nCan you imagine spending one hundred thousand dollars a day in and day out and then at the end you'd still have the principal amount leftover\nSusan you've worked with about two dozen individuals who've
