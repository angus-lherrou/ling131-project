Rebecca Traister you started to paint a picture of the history of women who've gotten angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme in how the story fits into the moment [noise]\nA shore so part of what happens is that women are told 'em as many of your listeners say that to be angry it's to be irrational\nUm and I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me um and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture\nBecause my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wake up call for me as someone who had to run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life because I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institutions and so my student who was a young black woman thought and be a kind\nOf authenticity and she helped me to realize that\nMy anger wasn't keeping me from doing my job are showing up or offerings quality lectures are material or material but then it was\nActually helping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging other women to make which is ... knowledge that we have the right to our rage and to reject\nIdeas that say that when we're angry about legitimate injustices that this in some way makes us irrational or makes our claims illegitimate and when we then begin to\nOwn that anger doesn't mean that we would come destructive\nOr harmful it means that we happen to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power\nTo build the kind of world we want to see\nA and more women need to give themselves permission to do that\nI've given myself permission to do that I'm at in this moment I Am on the front lines of sayings women\nOutrage have the potential if we own it and if we don't apologize for us to change this very scary our trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about a we have a lot to be angry about uh but that anger is the catalyst for us to be able to do something about the things we see\nNow let's move from the Senate committee hearing room in the hallways around the Senate and even the books that are esteemed authors have written onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another\nA couple of weeks Serena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U.S open here's a cut I'll bring you back there to refresher memory of anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n[noise]\nSuresh I'm Shawnee you shared this moment along with the rest of America is Rena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who found that anger or weaponized against her\n[noise] Ah yes I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany in Tribeca and I have been talking about it was interesting because\nThere are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she she was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the u._s. open I Believe\nAnd so in that moment there were two very distinct response as if the responses of the people that really just wanted to see her in isolation acting um\nIn in this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of the power dynamics in the moment and the history in the context and the legacy\nOf discrimination within the sport that she has faced and so I think that one thing that has been unexplored\nIn the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict um what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine in the lessons of title nine ... we tend to think of it is\nUm athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the new wants to ...\nWhen you contribute to

from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper\nI I don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova his response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U. S. open and she said Martina speaking now said yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards\nBut serene and was wrong her encore behavior was inappropriate and I'm paraphrasing just because men region umpires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right and a champion Serena should not emulate it\nRight I'm Martina Navratilova was wrong or she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it as a moment of solidarity she tried police arenas conduct I'm as a lifelong\nTennis fan I'm I Am livid but Martina Navratilova reminded me that up until this moment\nMost white women in tennis have not been allies of the Williams sisters um do when I watch tennis with my friends who are African American tennis fans we talked about watching these matches on you because of the micro aggressions that come from white women\nWho are often knocking at the Williams sisters and having things to say but let me also add\nThat one of the things that was most infuriating about watching the way in which Ramos treated Serena was that there was a broader context to her anger not only did he accused her of cheating\nBut this also came out on the heels of reports that members of the u._s. Ga had been showing up to her house\nUnannounced and testing her over and over again on grounds that maybe\nShe was doping even though she has come clean on every drug tested even those statistics show that they were testing her double the amount that they were testing any other players on the women's side and so she had been subjected to repeated and dignity and then as the best tennis player

sitting in for Joshua Johnson we're talking about the power of women's anger in the current moment in America\nWhere I'm Talking with Rebecca Traister for New York magazine and the ... author of good in mad Britney Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage and also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book\nRage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment that said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment of Hillary Clinton and the twenty sixteen campaign and I don't want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for\nNavigating the shoals at how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton has a history of being\nVery careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America and in fact it was news in the two thousand and eight campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle and a half\nSo now a lot of people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was toned police listen\nI regret deeply\nHow angry\nTone of the campaign became [noise]\nNot your fault says one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately in that in Hillary fashion says I regret how nasty the campaign became\nA ... just this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's laughing here in the studio with me but how does that strike you [laughter] so she was ... she was very very careful in her choice\nOf words there to even as she was commenting on it I mean I think it was um\nIt was ridiculous that this woman was called an authentic while being held to the standard of care full control in her voice and her facial parents and her body and her mode of expression I mean the two candidates um that were her primary\nOr it could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they could pound ...\nYou know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power\nAnd we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord ... is so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton\nBoth Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political pressed for their particular skill and channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift they were able to give voice to this frustration and we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion\nAnd yet every time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ... a a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough said smile is if it was like some cat\nColor on the street smile more um she was told that regularly and I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in our own memoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her\nAnd how menacing and aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but that she was thinking no no no that's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad\nIt's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us is about how much energy\nWomen expend modulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically\nThat's something that that all three of us are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expression\nNow I Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last ... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger\nGoes because this is a moment in America and let's be realistic moments have a way of fading they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nMaybe the cameras in all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Britney Cooper are are not as interested anymore you know in in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many want any listeners I Want to play you another mash up of some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling\nMy name's Aaron I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is Sarah from Cincinnati when I wrote my anger bubble over and I get really angry out loud it\nIt really doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as being angry are overreacting women yelling even in this day and age that very acceptable\nMen don't seem to have that same problem and I'm starting to feel like maybe it's not just the personal issue and dealing with the book to be nice and and uh and keep our mouth shut however\nI Am so angry and so angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm turning my anger into action I guess it helps to feel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging I think that but when they have to do we have to take that anger hold on to it and that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from listeners women who it feels like there's a the mirror transferring\nSome of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action industries taking action maybe at the ballot box we got this tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville I'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office\nI'm running for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on\nMy determination to be a voice for all and the focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracey as one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation of Brittany Cooper I Want to talk about where\nThis goes in terms of maybe the midterms that might be the most immediate effect I'm I\nNone of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any\nPollster or political analyst worth anything is looking down and what the ...\nThat women are mad women are going to vote and women are going to form a title even twenty Eighteen one way or the other\nSo lonely and that is as it should be um I'm particularly heartened by ah the Stacey Abrams campaign down in Georgia we have the opportunity to have the\nFirst black woman I'm governor of a state of a former slave state or the ... campaign they're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing we've been seeing that since twenty sixteen we had a wave of a progressive as sort of radically\nProgressive black mayors in the deep south and so one of the things that I Want to challenge folks to do as we think\nIn this moment is to actually look at what people of color are doing not just women but particularly black women in these elections the ways that we have the channeling our anger on for decades and decades and that started with the way that we voted for Hillary Clinton in this most immediate political\nMoment um but to your earlier point about whether or not\nOur anger can be sustained\nUm I think that I think that this can be sustained I think that we have to remember that the women's movement in this country do it goes through ebbs and\nAnd from fully and fully PC a law

hit with a one two punch of a massive\nCorruption scandal and a stunning economic collapse now unemployment in Brazil is at Thirteen percent the country has sixty thousand homicides per year on average and its current president boasts of an approval rating of just three percent\nAll of that is the backdrop to Brazil upcoming presidential elections far right populist ... he's facing off against the leftist his rival Fernando ... died on Sunday and the lead up to the election has already been packed with drama\nIt'll stabbing last month and we're here to talk about what the election means for Brazil and how what happens in Brazil will reverberate across both America's\nMonica to bowl is he or she is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics she's also director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins university\nAnd she cheese here with me in the studio Monica thanks for being here thank you for having me up Bryan winter is editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the counsel of the Americas he joined us over Skype from Sao paulo in Brazil Brian thanks for being here\nHello Todd happy to be with you good to talk to you and ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center he's also with us here in Studio Palo thanks to you for being here last year to be a well Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you honor is here to start\nA let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him as ...\nAs a retired army captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades now\nI'm ... despite having sat in Congress\nFirst so much time he he shows open loading for uh for the legislative body I mean he said over the years numerous times that the Congress is dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists\nAnd and other political opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not\nA popular figure but\nIn the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd those messages um are resonating\nA lot more with people when they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has a ten point lead an old over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth\nAnd that one is that one's a close call right now between him and and the guy he's likely to face\nWith this Fernando had died\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty ten to twenty Fifteen and this seemed like just such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last military rule from Nineteen sixty four\nIn Nineteen eighty five but being here this week\nA lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year some people just both wrote a brine we're going to work on your Skype line\nA little bit of will will get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast he's not as\nFiery as ... of course ... has been described by some as Trump being or maybe more akin to ... in the Philippines likes to waive guns around the the drug dealers should be shot or threatens to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent for for of Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him um is that he's not a an organic member of the Workers Party the tea um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the ... the far left so\nHe's not he's a moderate um with the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take this sort of center left stance so the party itself now is very much hard left um the candidate though isn't\nA that being said the the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both so narrow\nUm is this anti PT vote so these elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not see it rather than\nWe are going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we're going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play in I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're going to talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has\nCompulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do come out to the polls what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nA decisive in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally the eighty percent of the voters show up or we may have less of a proportion this time or\nOne important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank will cancel do vote because that is important whoever gets a fifty percent of the valley devotes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nOr we're both from when they more like the according to the late ... is that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood people are angry people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil or regardless if they are the less from the left from derived from the center people feel absolutely fed up with politics with politicians\nAnd that there is no alternative because there is not going to be admitted very cool in Brazil and uh we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm both an hour oh has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waiting machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or or drug dealers are thieves\nBeing shot but there's been some actual violence in this campaign last month ... was actually stabbed at a campaign rally or what happened there and what's happened since how has it affected his standing among voters in Brazil\nIn a way I mean it was I think all of us were paying to see a political violence at that level and I was personally awful for for both in our oh he he almost died\nGive double UCI is one of the things you need to stay connected and form throughout the seasons put us on this fall to do list making contribution to the station to hear from every season at Cape and islands\nDot org support comes from you and from the cultural center of Cape Cod in South the arm is hosting music every weekend in October including folk artist grace Martian on the thirteenth and singer songwriter Roger saloon on the twentieth cultural center of Cape Cod tickets on line or by phone\nAnd from ...

T.\nThey go back to the impeachment of earth that as one major argument for why you know things that the Workers Party has been let's say unfairly treated and the way that the that that things have gone down\n[noise] Matt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country the greatest country that never was meaning that Brazil has had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor\nWith the United states Apollo Matt makes a good point Brazil was celebrated\nAs the rising star not only of Latin America of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top\nAre now horrible recession horrible corruption what happened in Brazil where was the Brazil that that hosted the Olympics in was and was on the way up\nWell I think Brazil believe too much in the magic that it's a country ... best and can be great and forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build that country ah one of the major betrayal is precisely the workers bar too far to the was led\nBy a man born in poverty or that to build this very successful ... own initially ethics in politics\nThere is this sense after Brazil a\nBasic ... riding a wonderful wave in international economics big producer of commodities had the wonderful moment Barbara too was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well a than reality hits\nA ruler made a very bad choice and his successor a and a a lot of a shock to came and the magic would disappear or what we have today is a consequence and this is what I\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support WBAI at Cape and islands data work\nWell there's certainly a positive is the fact that the states in Brazil is basically broke\nAnd we have run off the money or all that green now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be called from that from a ... reality ... basis where the government has run all the money we have to adjust the economy\nThe measures necessary to do that are very off an\nAnd none of the candidates have explain exactly what the how they plan to go from the\nGyms now Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Brian date you recently wrote where you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite\nNot enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that tourists conclusion well if\nYou look around right now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be on inspiring um the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program\nI feel like they're voting against somebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences\nOf that is is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned tie the degree of cynicism a degree of disbelief that people have in our system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen\nThis happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world\nBut this democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its politicians because of this\nCorruption scandal than virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the Pew Research center and twenty Seventeen that\nThat just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest of thirty eight countries that that that you surveyed ... and that just shows you the climate here right now\nFor fear that both denaro if elected we basically have carte blanche to take a you know hard right turned it could involve the curtail moment of civil civil liberties and and and other things\nI I and my time and this week um I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile\nAnd this just blew me away I mean it it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back to previous periods of military rule\nNineteen sixty four was the last two I thought that that was real Brazil that had been firmly relegated to the history books and\nYou know maybe maybe maybe they are maybe it is getting a little bit melodramatic in some quarters but but they're real fears and and and people are scared right now well\nBrian you mentioned a statistic that was disturbing only eight percent of Brazilians say their representative democracy is the best form of government now I'm an right to the point ... emails us why are we so concerned about the right versus

Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended cabin on he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody saw it I'm a single white male people want me to shut up\nAnd I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably\nWhite men everywhere but contrast that\nWith the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve hears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner in twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years you've been the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker that\nThe Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that we're in for you know they good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are dead men walking as far as\n[noise]\nNow back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quip Timmy and any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough\nTo survive as a Republican Party or the future meeting Republicans had to broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics flash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore\nStunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hulk vacation in the Trump beer it said to you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean it tells me that the divide is deepening and you know did tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand\nAnd deeper in the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after the twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally looked at the Mitt Romney's last to Brock Obama included what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically\nThe way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term they came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election and that's a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixty one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with their voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand ... granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator from one more term or is he is he converted what's he think I mean look there's there there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know to give you a couple of them that that that that jumped out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk if you are seen as separating yourself from this president your next primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being\nA being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there is also the theory that hey part of this is\nLindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you go off with him\nMaybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence him but I think one of the other lessons is to is it is again Lindsey Graham looking at Trump twenty sixteen and saying\nThe Republican Party would go down this road and then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think tells Lindsey Graham and just ... more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacturing and fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's\nChanged his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors expressed their genuine irritation with me\nThat I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation\nOn the merits and in Steve you're nodding because that does not sound surprising to you yeah well what he's describing his ticket splitting\nYeah at the end political science they did the voters who go and they were Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal isn't All right let's get back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve ... so much of what your book is about\nUh

Ninety two on the Arsenio Hall's show remember him ... before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because of the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party it was also the moment that\nWas June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second but in third place in the presidential race at that point Berkeley sort of Ross Perot is taking place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two\nHad was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of slick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li ... scheme is way out of\nOut of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to did change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around interviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about\nHere was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hot at that moment you showcase a different side of your personality and it was Ninety two it wasn't just are sending them Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point\nThe entire Perot phenomenon began in February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Laurie can and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on in February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states\nI'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA
