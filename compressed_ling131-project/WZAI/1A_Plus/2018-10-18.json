would you mind reading from it's about halfway down patriots won the part that begins when we were half a mile from home\nSo almost the end of page eighty three which ends with the word flying would you read that first please\nA sure\nAnyway and offer ... when we\nWhen we were half a mile from home in Maryland police cars stopped us just like when they stopped us in Mississippi you set up in your seat ... kept both hands on women look straight ahead\nYou took out your University of Maryland I D and took my red black and green African medallion it into my public enemy T shirt you told me to sit up keep my hands on the dashboard don't say a word\nOfficer no down and look to your window when I saw your face\nAnd watch it melt into black grits evidence police started approaching me more often and Mississippi I wanted a superpower to melt every gun in the world and the black grits officer asked why we had Mississippi license plates\nBecause we are residents of Jackson, Mississippi you say I have a post doctoral appointment at the University of Maryland College park have done anything wrong officer\nWhen officer told you to speak up and claim you changed lanes without signaling you kept your grip on the steering wheel and said I did not change lanes without signaling you spit up behind me so I signal and changed lanes officer try to laugh in your face if he asked for your license in registration\nIs that your main he asked you he needs to show some identification to\nYour hands came off the steering wheel and you pointed at the officers face move away from my car you said that as much how he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification may I have your badge number please I hated how it sounded when you didn't use contractions the office to ask both of us to step out of the car\nWe will not get out of his car you said louder this time\nWe have done nothing wrong my fist were bald up and I was edging towards the driver's side window you slapped me across as much as what the back of your hand and told me to be quiet and unclean to my office right as another officer pulled up the first officer who is now laughing walk back to the second offices car\nYou eventually shelled a second officer your license and your University of Maryland id officer looked at the id flipped it over and told us to have a good night\nNever give them a chance to take a shot you finally said after we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it they will take it I wondered why you set it three times and why you never told me to shoot back\nMississippi Marilyn it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot Joe Black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they had their guns and say you killed yourself\nI hear you I told you and try to make you laugh wedding you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't and they instead of their though\nIf I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us you said oh you wouldn't I told you that fool got mad because you were speaking correct English you looked at me like you were thinking you might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you\nDo not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you I'm an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back\nThat cop gave me the bubble guts you laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't while I was in my room change and you told me to write about what I learned from the experience with the police I wasn't sure what the right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seemed like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cut in a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky and the biggest problem was police weren't the only people do in the shooting\nThey were just the only people allowed to walk around and threatening us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style of fly\nOther eggs are heavy psyche us they leave and there is a lot going on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it\nYeah I mean that's the crust of a lot of uh the relationship talk about in this book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to had to go to a new school and eighth grade was the first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd a few my best friends from a previous school were there and when my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way you did every morning when we were at a school in Jackson\nAnd long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told and put the knife away treated the knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers\nAnd in that situation I learned that sometimes and often a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so ah my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not giving them a chance to look like\nEat in a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out of the library without checking it out\nAnd that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure about this this a theory my mom my head you know you can duck them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what

die to work\nWith these things that she was telling you were the way of the world and you are trying to understand them how did that affect your relationship with her\nYeah one one way I think a lot of just traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful that my mother was telling me things some things that were right some things that were wrong\nUm she started to be a a a lot more active in trying to police me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more\nUm but and we could talk about those things sorted we could talk about police we can talk about white people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about was like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different relationship\nBut I Would never talk to her about that fighting that protection she saw me in relationships that were like difficult for me where I was being bad to myself well I was mistreating people emotionally we didn't know how to talk about any of it so while we're doing really good sort of at talking about how we survive outside in the house\nThe particular kinds of violence has happened in in my house were completely um silent we never knew how to talk about it and so you know it took me until I was like forty to forty one years old to have the guts to actually write into some of what was happening in our house and try to connect that to what was happening outside of our

Pelosi's name still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but it is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off\nKnow a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics in the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can I ... in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are you\nAbout the hardest core a people within the party but in fact\nWe're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest we're seeing high turnout in primaries and in special elections\nAnd you know frankly using Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a Pew sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential plea but for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip the house\nChurch that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now\nOne thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks who work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and are particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home and I'm an off year or mid term here and there's a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color or Latinos African Americans and Asians\nWho are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and ...\nIs there are certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout slide you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch goal but the Democratic party's aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan a congressman who chairs the demographic democratic congressional campaign committee is\nThey don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house of turning the house blew but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue waves crashing over a pick up a\nOn delivering that twenty three at turning the house bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a a balance of power right now Republicans control every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue way was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to be pumped again\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling what are some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a two run Congress ... the Democrat in your district or the Republican the ... in your district you\nKnow we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public bowling shown it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take the at least those twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when I gamed out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive despite all the talk of cabinet or you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats win half of those that's the house\n[noise] glad to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about the midterms including about the nature of polling in general do medical I Love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with the elections with not having enough holes in down ballot races even even U.S House but state house and stuff because if it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat\nAt least at the federal and state level but it it's a good weekend that I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own it so I Need to know it raises host or not if it's a if it's issue where if my vote might be the deciding vote and I need a whole I Need some polls\nMy vote to change my vote\nAlan thanks for your comment Domingo that cracks me up or if he wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience then he should do so\nI get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page please discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with a horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on polls one such reporting could affect turnout or elections are not sporting events\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen [noise]\nYeah I mean I you know look I mean this is a this is a tried and true a criticism\nUm you know we can get into the science of polling and whatnot and I would disagree that were obsessed quote unquote with polling we do use it to pepper our coverage and to give us a sense of what the snap shots are within districts in fact\nA wedding I divorced home nacho town that next time on the radio our\nSaturday afternoon on WC AI\nSupport comes from you and from Cape Air your wings across the northeast flights to the Cape and islands including service between Hyannis province town Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket\nAnd also seasonally to New York in so at one eight hundred Cape Air and from Cape Cod academy announced avail founded in Nineteen Seventy six dedicated to providing a challenging curriculum where the quest for educational excellence is shared among students and faculty alike Cape Cod academy learn more become more\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with the legacy of putting clients financial wellbeing first learn more at Raymond\nAnd from the science Sims foundation since Nineteen eighty five supporting advances in science education and the arts towards a better more just society more information is available at size Sims foundation dot org\nBack now to our conversation with one of summers will be Associated Press Katie centers of politifact and NPR's Dominican months and are all still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the mid term elections email us one a ass W.

P. R. dot org let's get to some of your comments about the midterms Laurie emailed I Am a lifelong Democrat and I can tell you what frustrates me and has for years\nThe complete inability of the gyms to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democratic Party website and the front page does not see what they are for does not told me what they care about\nOne summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up to the terms how common is Laurie complaint and how well are Democrats doing an answering it\nI think the lord is pointing to is actually really comment and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how it affects that and number of the conversations I had I have recently wrote an article that looks at how Democrats are trying to\nMake sure they have record mid term turnout and they said that when they're talking to voters are sending out mailers are going and knocking people's doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure\nThat they're telling their voters that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations that are about just running against President Trump's\nBase um I was talking to some groups that did some field testing recently among Latino voters and they said ... and when they did this field testing they were saying people were turned out they said if they got to try a mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump's face on it\nThey be super turned off right they throw that away they wouldn't even engage or see who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that match and you talk about what they can do for them what's at stake that that's\nThat's why you hear are Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear about health care message I think as Dominican noted being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nThat scene with one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what John left in our inbox\nShould John raise share to New York\nSo often on the shows\nPeople face the Republicans that Democrats or Republicans the Democrats or Republicans but\nInstead of doing that they should be focusing on specific policies namely the Democrats that stand for such a threat to\nThe Republicans that stand for such and such it helps educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just growing Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us now Dominican so for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stand for ... I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for ... or the Democrats who have done\n... to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too broad brush\nYeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where\nAre the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what\nPresident Obama did a and regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example a by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party and twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans and how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties stand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this midterm\nKatie I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight out or the listener writes with the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advised to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Katie\nI think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party as a as an Israeli\nI'm right and I think that's because it's effective and that really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do a memorable and it's certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of that and that's why we have jobs fear factor [laughter] it's funny to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever\nTheir medical research on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers of women running a record numbers of el ... of out el ... candidates running some of them spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier give us a sense of what that means for\nThe midterms and whether or many of these candidates are considered\nTo send a strong chance of winning well look you're\nCorrect that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think a lot of Native American candidates or you know just to New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is\nA an openly gay man he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire as a Democrat now\nBut when again we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected and when we talk about when the word I'm a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women\nWho have been nominated for a for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three has been democratic women just if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running\n... that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nSo I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers are basically saying that three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic woman who'd been nominated\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right and the the wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill areas\nHave been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll and you know they are going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWanted there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between here and send them at the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican you know Arizona is going to have a female senator in that seat and I wonder how much you see this\nSo but do we get the sense that both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSure so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates are certainly more on the side of Democrats than Republicans I think that's frustrated and number of Republican women I spoke to two women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate\nYoung promising Republican conservative women from the local those local level seats all the way up so nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's list the group that cultivate and backs\nA pro abortion rights when female candidate so there there is some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues that he actually asked\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell about that the question came and this back and forth about the Senate Judiciary committee and the lack of Republican women on that panel during the hearings around\nDr ... Ford and justice Brett now justice Brett Kavanaugh and these women were really and why there were no women there Mitch McConnell said you know that's something he doesn't like it's something he wants to see more up but I still haven't heard Republicans\nActually plant in West to bury which are alpaca friends you're listening to WC a our local public radio for the Cape coast die and\n\nYou're listening to Ninety point one double UCI in WC A.

a college degree not\nAnd we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of these skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship\nBut that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute for workplace skills and innovation\nWrote a book called the job you and he put a question and answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work when should you consider taking one where do you go to find what you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures without a four year degree on line\nWork that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org before we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing is a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is adjust and aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways and that well I think\nThe main thing that is that what she right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year\nIt's sort of lagging this prosperous economy that we hear so much about I think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs go yet by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main a stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reverse course and started becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that they're in lies to crunch\nBut it gets to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management have been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted a zillion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what his manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso see what this is Christine card the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome thank you\nRyan can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture as we've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level sure why I think that it's important to\nAre we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity a start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places\nAre at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently that describes how over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a tax club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nI think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity and the national data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages\nAs employers compete for workers and we just haven't observe that you know overall real wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins are for example a wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions throwing a bit faster in New England in the Pacific states but ah but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that that's all to say that\nThey were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nHeard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who worked for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field or it's enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nNot supply and Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the the minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage thousands traveled to Massachusetts daily were the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\nGr [noise] well I and I don't have any empirical data on why so many uh employees are working in math and traveling there that I Know and I live there that they play it over as a million or caters everyday into the city and out and many of those that coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we as into the jobs that are out there\nWhen he sees the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\n... that\nYou know I feel like you know my point of view is\nSort of a wider industry perspective in in the sense that I worked in technology for the last ten years and coming to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high demand um occupation such as automotive construction manufacturing\nThere just seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's in your factoring or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about\nThe nature of will be described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed to all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs you're in Manchester you've been out

Bo and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers\nChris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want to experience people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voice mail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics and we're out and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months\nAnd we're really struggling with two items one is employed turned over where there are chasing higher wages and and new facilities are new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade job shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be\nI Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in I Will withhold my thoughts on your abandoning your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but this listener has an interesting point\nCounties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers to the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAnd accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan was the idea of Randy ... the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to winning\nThanks Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\nYeah they come home award program that we launched and then ended in early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship Venice miles on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarships of talk about and doing that but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly upon completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work as really on home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair county\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that if they have some family connection here there's probably a better better they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county paint me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of lake here on on the St Clair river um our largest town of court here on as a population of about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did I have a fortune five hundred company in our region\nA thirty percent of our workforce leaves are counting heads down and metro Detroit to to be employed but they love the small town life or the family friendly environment the manatees\nAre were small town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged on the economic health of regions like park here at er Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right\nAre are true health how did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people get their pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come on program was once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was the last to be government business\nAnd the other sector we realize that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan\nIt had to be an organic planned that drove our prosperity\nWe're speaking to Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair accounting in St Clair accounting Michigan\nAlso still speaking to us T. Bo the president of applied economic research and Ryan non policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies\nAt the Brookings Institution still time to get in some more of your questions and thoughts about the labor shortage won a at W.
