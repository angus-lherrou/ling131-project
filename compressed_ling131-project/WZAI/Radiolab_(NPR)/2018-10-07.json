N. Y. [noise]\nHey I'm ... Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to\n[noise] we're going to start\nThis show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before and say something high [laughter]\n[laughter] okay I think it's good All right\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started again what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting and Fergus and\nThere is growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nWhen that became a national\nThere was a lot of ... and the press how many people do we think killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire\nAnd will become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is\nWe don't know they have no idea because nobody's track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere within the police department itself in the police department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency ... and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that's right so Ben and his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBrazil birth study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics\nAre pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records loss and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... we got from Ben sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\n... three hundred and eighty eight emails\nAsking for five years or so paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting\nNot for this involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved is is a massive thing that involve probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nLike Ben put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of flu show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah how many how many documents you think you have sitting on the stuff is probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall we've got um broken down by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B county Booker aton Boeing and beach uh all the way through the alphabet and you basically just have a all these uh\nBut it costs ... as a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represents\nA eight hundred and thirty one\nShootings I Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and and six years time two thousand nine to two dozen fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team [noise] didn't involve a an armed suspect was their chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons and some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will last link to it from my website radio lab that are highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest in sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most basic level are are that\nAbout a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nOff their meds at the time of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they hold suicide by cop which is where somebody who is usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think his weapon so it's ... I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you\nSuicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know they're the news briefs\nThat you see once or twice a week\nBut it was news to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the number say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nYou know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nDoesn't tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for the same demographics and as we've that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very far ... percent six years\nHe says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were in why we want to start this mess still just moved by the single case is the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know [noise] I mean they're all written in this ah\nLemon investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call and this is the Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles armed with a knife at a party to fight it house every one of these every report is at least one human life\nSomeone was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nSo we have on this table that the investigation of the death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right\nBegins 'cause the brown\nVeins something happened in\nWhen we say this is the club that\n\nSo after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of the Mondale down their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nLike you guys do this every every event or a no no I just wanted to know the ones and has been telling everyone about\nThis de ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nSo no we didn't know anything about this but it it must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping remind right we all just simply trying to find a way it was a crystal gathered like\nProbably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I Hope or here's how I deal with my grief\nYou can either get the um the larger staged a certain point was talking to these two women and she just had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like somebody\nThat I open my windows and I just knew will go through my house she says the stage concert down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over the Christel House [noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just had fun\n\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together\nSome earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel room again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over it and how we speak in each other head on the couch you know a metric it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the policy\nIt's all very much for the children that looks like therapy for\nVicki threatening pass but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe we're at ... ... to ... and it was when Christ lead some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grad so we usually the video that\nMy house probably over like right\nAnd then the police car that came behind them was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we recall excuse me in a vegetable garden 'cause the garden was in\nGoing and all that\nThat I Am saying 'cause um when they when they you know when they took him away and released and sit down and take the stuff we came back at us all you can smell was and so now like when you have any like it's it's not it's it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions you get that smell like it just you get those flat mhm in\nYour country and just brings you right back here mhm\nYep\nAnd the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\nChristmas I started to get ... some of the other women started to cry [noise]\n\nAnd then you don't want me to uh take from my find the best model what about let me\nA couple of women had him either phone my\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face\nThree to one and\nAnd we all sort of walking back because\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for sharing\nWith us but I Know [noise]\nIt was up to the very least once a week\nAnd I threw a clock in the morning [noise]\nThat's what I remember the and I used to tell ya how do you live so far away from\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nMy son's greatest about Fifteen minutes talk about this\nAt home I have to go there all the time of course\nYeah for how could you not\nThen of course like you want to go take a chair\nSit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a listen if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know about as like a certain time every\nDay and it's this little white man we share everything set up like he literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day\nMy dad would be I don't know if you if it's a way I like going on and all of that is a little white guy that always sit\nHe take his chair hold\nSo that trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise] or you\nCan either repeal it was the mother Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown smothered Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter\nWas loaded into the ground\nAround this time that a few of these women started call themselves the mothers\n\n\nAnd it was weird because in the short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time is support group and suddenly become\nComing up and down the cop with a gun a man with a nice day\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between them and

like ... to the cops and then\n[noise]\nThe guy was a buddy campfires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\nYou're gonna do you're going to\nAnd the cop who's got his gun out he was over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then she changed central four cups and then\nThere may not have it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you're\nLucky you didn't do your best shot you want to die if you want a dog you can die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nTheir scent of counseling on T.\nV. to pick him up walk them over to the squad car with a man\nAnd the un said this is the thing that you guys will you use this\nI'm a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the point to eat at home or the officers used time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up and\nThe the guy leans in the current judge that went over there now you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal command first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest in communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek isn't just a black\nMan shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there there's a lot easier to see somebody whose name was and faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finished watching the video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\n... through the neighborhood I mentioned on the front steps waves of hatred what are you doing man that dared does stupid son of a bitch you don't have close came to be in bed going backwards medication wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now\nNow again are almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say primary election among the winners they told him he just leased his now is Sarah like she would was elected sheriff of Linn county\n[noise] friendly\nWhich the county that Daytona Beach belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a job with long his organization called her which decrease executive research forum\nBig coalition and police chiefs and in twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order\nIs the sanctity of human life [noise]\nWhen you contributed WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support WC I at Cape and islands dot org\nJust these guiding principles basically saying that being the top is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive\nConversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know maybe I'm just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have I've become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America at least maybe slowly but but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and that sort of felt the same way too but\n[noise] there was this experience than I had read realized how far [noise]\nHope has to go [noise]\nThat's coming up right after this break so

this is radio ... we had been discussing police violence and raise mostly in Florida we met the mothers who gather from all over the country I mean that the police chief in Daytona who who's trying out some different things so I was thinking maybe maybe yeah maybe there's a little bit hopeful yeah it's the\nFeeling we had a but then you realize hope it's a funny difficult thing um because well let ... reporters taken from here\nWe are here to see the Tosh Clemens ... mother Rodney Mitchell\nSo it's actually the woman who you heard earlier I'm back at the community center I've met for the ... of the mothers who lost their children are that's actually when I first met her and had been reporting on Natasha for like a couple of years by this point and we were there because Ben was going to hand a ton of documents over ten Pasha on her son Romney's case shouldn't have any\nAnd I was there because we set up a short interview Natasha but when we got your doors [noise]\n\nShe just started sobbing [laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\nAnd\nThen I just had no idea what\n\n\nBut then she had just turned the tape recorder off\nHuh what was what was happening in that moment well okay so to back up so meeting somebody like the chip would you know I'm like there is a sort of hoping that I I Believe but the thing about a chip would share of the police chief is that the only have\nAnd that's really about it after that it goes into the court system and so for Natasha I'm her son Ronnie twenty three years old unarmed was shot and killed by two police officers during a traffic stop\nAfter the shooting a judge ruled that the two officers had done nothing wrong they acted in accordance with the law\nAnd it just so happened that forty five minutes before then and I showed up at her door she just got an email from her lawyers seem that the appeal that she'd filed against that decision I had just been rejected and so we sat there in ... department for a while we actually\nEven less for
