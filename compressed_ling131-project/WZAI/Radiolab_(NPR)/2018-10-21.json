I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't see that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we thought we'd goes is on the radio yeah so she got kids with the you may want to make you wanna yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon ... so let's start can we start in two thousand they sure about what the song yes please check\n[laughter]\n\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh eighth sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters\n[noise] Facebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you guys\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm Stephanie Miller and\nWhat are you calling from\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would uploads those photos to Facebook and these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\nNow\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that the small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shot Facebook triggered hordes now in what would become a loud Facebook do Facebook rockets\nAnd global\nBad embattled Facebook CEOs but today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches\nBut but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them\nFree speech [noise]\nViolence against roe kingdom mostly what we can say in what we can't say that again\nBy like ... what we can see and what we can see it led Mueller right kids in front of me\nOn the Internet\n\nThank you Mr Chairman Mr sacrifice I got to\nDo you subjectively prioritize or censor speech\nCongresswoman we don't grow overdoing it censoring speech but\nThere are actually what what what really grabbed me was\nWas discovering that underneath all of this\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook that digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and die\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow which made me wonder like\nWhy are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning in two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all\n[laughter] [noise]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employee is one of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so at the time\nWhen I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this was in the early to thousands\nSeismic changes this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path nice spaced out is now the most visited website us\nFacebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of confidence like room with a big long table each of them in front of their own computer\nAnd things that come up onto their screen flag day to Facebook and a leg\nMeaning like I use or saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing\nAnd and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nNaked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason why someone had reported\nBecause it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and\nEverytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it out and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask\nWhat do I do at this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you'd Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any Senate written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one ...\nAnd basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breastfeeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until [laughter]\nRise up fight for the rights that rather than the anyway\nNow a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but\nAccording to Stephanie mirrored those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized\nIronically enough through Facebook so to coincide with alive protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse and two for one day\nChanged their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title of our group a phase of breastfeeding is not a team and it caught on the social networking website is under fire for its policy on photos of women right leading their children down in twelve thousand members participated and the media requests started pouring and a half percent benefiting\nIs now I didn't hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington Post\nSo the Internet is an interesting\nAround twenty can they decided to start outsourcing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter Aurora Herman drawl as well as\nI mean I Would guess of their building Dublin where we sent reporters Guerra stack scene where they can ... treat everybody fever English and we sent\nThem there to try to talk to some of these people who for living they did a computer and collectively click through\nPop up on the screen every day wow well we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like [noise] well I thought I'm\nFound out pretty quickly ... none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do and so there's a lot of renting even mean happening\nAnd I certainly did you go to work [laughter] so now I don't I start to wonder you\nI Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like in India that they signed\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] uh [noise] willing to talk do you want to be named or do you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's the only find you know I just go to the industry I don't want them\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nLike a tax credit any ... about ... watch\nBlind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I think that she's monitor graphic images\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact at ... ... yeah I tell you got your\nSo this guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his head phones [laughter] ignored ...\nCase a case by case by case or the high ... every day I was just ... alleged official which\nFight five thousand a day you just said\nYeah it was like it was a lot of case yeah he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\nWell ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just the idea that ... ah it's two ... two X. rated or\nClicking through he came across\nYou too you know get squashed by attached to you know people cages ... like [noise] a Thirteen year old girl I had an effect in a way it's not just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up and I did you did did you\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be up at night uh\nCatch themselves thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat they were very specific like I said I couldn't watch it was like okay so ... ... S C I was like okay I had to wear exploding like I have to walk away\nAnd I just I have to I chose to real [noise] I I saw that ah it's it's a classic case yesterday\nA different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of this stuff that you and I don't have to see because they're going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well yeah and and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a door or terrorists propaganda\nOr that they're getting better automate that they had the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of other terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nOh but a\nMoving onto our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on and that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming out of there will be laughter oh really there will be comedians there will be jokes to me is hey All right

after several other bands shoot forward this is months later a friend of hers had posted an article in underneath that in the comments section there were guys posting just really nasty stuff\nMake sure I emphasize that these policies they're not going to please everybody they often don't don't please everybody that's working on the policy team at Facebook but if we want to have one line that we enforce\nConsistently that it means we have to have some pretty objective black and white rule [noise]\nWhen we come back those rules they get toppled\nThis is Danny from Denver, Colorado radiolab

you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing to do with their kids in the room might want to sit it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty thirty ... strike\nCorrelate Rhonda Merrill aside but sorry but if they can break we had some

then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's ... ... meanwhile\nCBS the areas on the other side of the country is fine I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees are clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news ...\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so\nI have memories of of watching some of the coverage shelling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo\nPublished on line and it wasn't long after that\nSomeone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but\n[noise] pretty quickly\nVoters going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platforms it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see a bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however half the ... says\nNo the other people are saying this is newsworthy\nEssentially this photo as being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received push back\nWell I was saying that what we prided ourselves on with not making those calls and there are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements we made the\nGuidelines for a moment like ... the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking a downed like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common\nThis is important and yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how\nDo you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of the stuff\nThat in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWord starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive ... down in order\nWe were essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this doubt\nYes so I mean yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook a sort of collective scrapbook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now and news organizations friends' parents\nDeal I mean let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question that kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly\nFacebook is and this question has been\nPopping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when Dr bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook\nSo which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest\nPublisher center this is a\nView us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology in front of your response for your constant which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\n... and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the well Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to fewer regulations\nAs of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what were what really strikes me about all of this is if you're you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective as possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy ... they'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this or that having just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico\nAnd it's a video of a of a woman being ground and forced onto her knees in front of a camera", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "21"}
