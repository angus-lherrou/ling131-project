I'm rubber crow which uses radio lab and today we have\nA legal case\nWell it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um what my husband and I referred to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away it it gets under your skin this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she said that I'm not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna feral who brought us the story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten yeah\nIt it just made me\nKnow whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started sure Jim Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist one newspaper guy\nHe's been reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the out around ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondacks pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM\nTo campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw for this middle aged man peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on a sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get the\nOther campers you got all four of them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen or killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook him into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them\nOf the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some ropes basically he had he had to each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed to Adam and then the last one he tied\nSo after you had the four people tied he went back to the first boy\nEighteen year old Phillip them blue ski on because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise]\nAnd then they heard filled voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing dumplings ski with his back and I used to have been five times and the cat\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol and melon Alfie ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had um lay down in a ditch next to him\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nFreeman in um the killer laying in the chapter about an hour and the men come\nThe way had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted done a killer and Friedman laying down in the ditch and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot and the manner the gun just kind of stood up\nCalmly and Cooley walked into the forest and thus began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see\nWhen the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by there was the scene like a never been seen before or after\nToday where you've broken down on manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and that comes back with an ID\nEight thirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York as the fugitive police are looking forward today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape served seven years\nNow armed with a thirty thirty rifle a knife and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday how do you feel at night when the people got panic when you're all are well one of the doors are locked people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving round here but people left the area so fast let them cleared out last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left barbecue smoldering they left behind coolers\nSays a man has dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food in those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follow her lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on it\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named Hillary la block spotted gal\nSaid freeze or got big on something of that fact and Guerra started running\nBlocked fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm and the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they sub zero and he was laying down\nHe might be dead because he was just laying there but they you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with them they're really in the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise]\nBut you wouldn't talk\nAnd it's at this point that the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor release alarm and again he's\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation and we are recording\nSo the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank Armani Frank H R many\nBrenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use that urban but it is er money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon I learned I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money's now in his eighties\nHe's retired [noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert\nGirl um where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well\nWere there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway or ... or I like ... flights go for it like standing up for the gun and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defendants you're fighting the state and terrorists\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert De Niro\nYeah life you're strong to take your mo you need a forty five and a or to head the feelings of this guy is dead Andrews a love of the things are going to have\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things one one\nThat Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up mine shaft\nThe mine ... mine ... about an hour south of the hospital a burden federal Ron Mix and in that moment where you scared were you excited like oh you rub ... it's a high but you're scared you're concerned fear reform if you do\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit\nWe thought we were being followed by the state police\nAnd went into one bar where\nOne of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out for about thirty minutes don't you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up the back door [noise] took of\nDriving that lady friends car to drive the news and the tail and so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here this\nMay be as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine\n[noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren my chemistry and towns supervisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause if Ava system a road that goes to the mine is or what is your up to the mountains it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just a very icy that day this hair is used to be an old road [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hill is fairly feet or know leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm Larry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that Iranian as is the only way they could've came in here so\nHere we are in our Sunday suits and rebuild trudging choose for is looking for the\n[noise]\nSpent hours looking around [noise]\nAnd then [noise]\nWe found this was her friend well\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for it let's just get any such thing yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak\nBlue shoe and blue sneaker\nW UCI sustaining members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\n\nEventually algae found the other body Alisha house body she was in a cemetery where narrow headset he left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls ... yeah that's play that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took her to know to keep your confidences over\n... under the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that as yet that can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question or frightened and waking up when even if they have hired\nDetectives and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if the if if people are already dead than you who the below ...\n... that's right\nA really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nKen for that client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the agent of land or also\nA citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a\nThere's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right if we each year building on on the side of tell just tell tell\nYeah of course yes and I knew Mr hook from bully because his\n... my daughter were in the same flash and I knew him from church and\nWhat and if you have to be and then I'm On a few\nThe anguish of the parents of the family and yet you you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now what this [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder [noise]\nWe'll be right back [noise]\n\nHi this is already from

I'm I'm Ron I'm rubber crow which is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer bena feral and when we left it they were where they were stuck right when they knew this thing but he was a client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what what's their next move\nWild so they decided to put the bird plea bargain they take this information to the prosecutor and say I have information that will help you solve some cases some case yes\nAnd in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients to get ... into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage\nThat was the idea yeah you're going to give them a new moon you're going to take a ... well that's kind of gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again\nI Do to make a living\nHe was just barely getting by for a little while I think the older the stress and pressure to to to do\nIn fact he has a heart attack\nUm while this is all going on but eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar is that what Belgian our money did\nWas write what they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero\nI always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAnd Lisa told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them layers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was love\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest parts\nAnd I don't go was here or there was a lawyer to do this job a ... I was a good lawyer ... through\nArt everybody um and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teachers the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if\nPeople so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just stand\nUp I agree um his duties to his client represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and and talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story\nI always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on a phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan mother\nWas the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing well she's camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mind you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality and such\nDid that idea I'm asking that something that you knew a little ... schools are teaching and and you had any dealings with all about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nUh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd the first thing you'd heard than it was being taught when I reached out to yes was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing\nWe flew immediately and and went to the police station and up when we were there sitting with the police men they received the policemen at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend\nWhat his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really had any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nAnd in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a totally lie a lawyer\nMaybe he considered to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of of horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professor last students there um when they approach that says it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling\nWith the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um like you have a chance to get some of that um experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later and skills I I guess it's a struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I so\nI don't I guess\n\nI'm Wondering what we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know that you would want to share I don't know you don't have to but [noise]\nWell [noise] what can I say she was she did receive her degree pass too much sleep [noise]\nAh we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us\nAnd [noise] and then of course her boyfriend had just that summer\nAnd he had a full scholarship to Herbert any uh graduated just the year before and so to and I'm sure the other two children had great future ahead of them\nIt's just a horrible tragedy\n\n\nSnow it's horrible to be in the position\n[noise] I don't really know what we're what excuse for protesting the person the killer new justification you couldn't just to follow my mind\nExpects them [laughter]\nThat's the way it is [noise]\nI'm going to get just a minute of silence I tear if that's okay yeah [noise]\n\n",
