GBH each week eighty nine point seven Boston online at Cape and islands dot org serving the Cape the coast and the I mean\n\nWhat you [laughter] [noise] or\nYou are listening to radio lab\nRadio from W and why [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nIt's gone now to practice some very useful phrase is our freedom curve you repeat I remembered and could gather that's\nThis is radio lab today translation it's time to begin we'll have five experiments in translation trance creation\nReference number one the best poem was by my mother who got cut off the people who you know you try [noise]\nHi there Hi that Doug yes oh boy so uh this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug\nDoug Hoffman a professor of cognitive science Indiana University Bloomington\nUh you may know him as the guy who wrote ... Bach which was a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen Seventy nine but we actually got interested in and uh things that are produced Ritalin levy\nBecause of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking a French literature class on one day I came across this poem a tiny little about\nThe kind of sat right in the middle of the pay like a long stint sausage vertical a free\nWas super skinny and twenty eight lines long and long and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorized that I still not by\nHeart diplomas basically a get well card it's written by this guy ... who was a poet nearly Fifteen hundred at the court of queen\nAnd he wrote the pound for this queens daughter she was seven or eight and she'd gotten sick the flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and and I thought it was very sweet could you said in France let's just here at first yeah\nOkay it's called a ... done was that in my lab to a sick demos ... so to speak it can lead they affect young lady mommy none\nOf us who doesn't look boom through Lucy ... ... ... ... to beat them all ...\nVast beyond the tub boost used to ... to ... told my dad who to about ... about it ... on them for ... to ... I mean young\nOh my God it must have gotten so many checks and you know it's really [laughter] exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise]\nOkay so he reads a poem files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years he publishes his first [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decides to have it translates into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that home popped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is it what is the challenge okay what I meant was to say\nHere's the thing he says you've got this oh mommy none of them doesn't loom for and if you just focus on the word basically that just this guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like president who says ... I went on to wish you to open your doors get out into the world ... get out of bed\nEat some jam goofy too so you don't look so pale out and you lose your lumps shaped el dog units are like get better here's your good health to dwell on the bone I mean young\nBut just saying those words in English\nMisses the whole spirit of the ...\nThe tone the light hearted mess\nAnd this is key for doubt it also known as the bones form it's\nLittle soft that shape when the page the fact that the lines\nRhyme you know a B. B. C. C. D. D. and uh the first line ... young is identical to the last line I mean young to sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems they've known to Vermont oh and I did I say three syllables per low you didn't\nOr us three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became\nEmbroiled in the question of like how do you translate this pump in along the way even began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem for example vast sea onto the top boost used to like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the\nA little diagonal display here\nInstead of hurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of lurking in your instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their instead of squirming in ... that are burning up in bed instead of turning blue and bet\nOn and on and I came up with you want me to read my ...\nMy sweet dear I send cheer all the best\nYou're forced rest is like jail so don't ale very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick band you're a for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best soon arrives so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise help be near my sweet dear\nSo claim on his now Douglas playing all became Douglas and I I like the ones on jam became bread though the\nBread and butter butter bread yeah well I just figure jam and jelly they are words but the words represent concepts and the concept to have a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly\nTalking about bread and things that you spread it on oh ... some people would just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nLike he hadn't quite nailed it ducked sent the palm to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named oddly enough Bob French\nAnd I said hey Bob and you do it and Bob Said well give it a try first friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark halls and back\nIn soft still regain health dress and fleet off with me Clement who calls from\nVery different in tone and really quite marvelous\nHe got the pale face in there and got the gym Clements name in the middle but at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient which you could argue well it's an ancient pounds but Doug said no there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and when he ate was a sacrosanct number for this just lines though no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was a form that's what made the things funny charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel but nails before he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet I treat one regard Otis hard recluse colleagues friends chicken D.

about it and I think the fact that I'm doing that is serious and when I raised him by name in my comments today\nI carry it sounds to me like he's sort of insulted by the question and and you have to remember\nIt can be translated very much in are you doing something preferably a Lincoln financial transaction right and so what this journalist is saying is [noise] or you just talking about this or are you doing something\nMay be threatening you ... who is withdrawing eight or with strong support in Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about this we have\nPreviously called for the release of these individuals and that is the policy of our government and it's a serious policy thank you very very much\nAnd it seems to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me not being serious\nWe put in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding who carry or this or this fellow oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards [noise]\nCan you pronounce your name for me [noise]\nMy name is ... he's a young guy in his twenties and

to writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin was George Carlin mentioned\nOh because Carlin is a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language you're talking about the comedians of comedy comedian [noise]\nNext thing is about the English language it's about little expressions we use we we all stay in the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time\nIs one of his great subject really seem to examine these expressions and all the more interesting because he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he thought from schooling and one of\nGOP next favorite curling her some I really like just went to his about how Carlin hated euphemism\nLike words that hide the truth I don't like where's the conceal reality I don't like euphemisms and American English is loaded with euphemisms\nThe economy was wonderful about things like that was about both as she\nCalled me I've known people in this country and all our own people we shift them all away and we brought in these\nSenior citizen\nAnd he was on some of the reason we use ...\nAs I've just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in\nIntensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught we just want your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely I mean she's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs to the hill\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to decide something that you cannot disguise but Karlan is real point was that it it does our\nReactions to it that actually have like a cabin negative fat and it gets worse with every generation has this whole bet it's about um shell shock becoming pie TST he goes so goes it's in four different things in the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shall shots simple ... direct language two syllables shell shocked and then it became battle fatigue\nBattle for the for some of those now takes a little longer to say [noise] doesn't seem to hurt as much and then after it became battle fatigue then it became operational exhaust [noise]\nHey we're up to age syllables now then it became post traumatic stress disorder still a syllabus but we added a hyphen and then it became peachy as post\nYeah so imagine like a black screen and little tiny white dots all arranged in a line\nTo Emily was allowed to keep the brain poor device for about a year and a half and during that time the light\nRight resolution of it did get better as her brain learn to speak to him it was also\nWhen I saw people\nIn one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked her about this video that her mom it sent me showing her wearing the device and walking down the street she told me that usually you know now that she's\nBlind when she's walking down the streets of New York city especially uptown where the streets are a lot lighter\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her so\nI uh [noise]\nYeah I hardly ever notice other people walking around me it feels like I'm just walking\nI can always hear the topic and it sounds a tactic ... not ...\nBut she says when she put the device on and put those sensor undertone [noise] the sidewalk\nCame alive at night it was amazing like I did\nDean at the same time is now they're all they're all there again but you described right away that sounded\nAlmost like a painting\nLike really soft watches it everything was you know he stops nice soft boxes\nAnd can move\nThere is that why can't I can see their last living and I can see them again [noise] but I couldn't see them clear you know like I can see the change or\nWhether they're wearing a shirt or a short sirt

Ron I'm Robert Krulwich has his radiolab and today experiments in translation [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nLesson number five how does it make the ... without a ... to meet the right this is going to be sure you're ... the ... ... ... you know you try\nTo you guys mind if in the remaining few minutes we're going on an army fishing expedition sure sure it's the here's here's the here's our quandary Carl okay so what's your situation\nDown with a reporter and science writer Carl Zimmer to talk about our name all thing we were talking about something else in our name came up at the end 'cause heres why ever since we started doing this show Robert got his [laughter]\nGot his I got a little in system for the little ones I just in a cause you were like are innate we've got to do are now yes I said that are and I was like what do you want to do and you're like I Want to do our name and I was like but is there a story and you're like no no I didn't\nSay that I just said that that uh that that if you understood what our innate does you realize that translation is profoundly important to our existence that's what I said yeah well as often happens you or me down\nAs I find let's just try it and they'll say you know\nSo when we're talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town not secure your son's getting married yes he was and ah her I was doing like tech team worked for me\n[laughter] okay All right so the definition of translation and biology is taking a sequence in DNA and using that genetic code to translate it into proteins mhm [noise] right and the discovery\nOf this was maybe even more exciting than the discovery of the double helix structure really yeah\nIt was bigger than Watson and Crick yeah well at least equivalent wow so here's the quick story so what happened was\nOkay I suggest to set the table here we all know the DNA is a thing and that when you buy and you get half your DNA from mom and a half your DNA from your dad and Francis Crick and and er James Watson just figured out\nThe structure of DNA that basically the rest of the of DNA your recipe it's comprised of four bases in a long string\nA T C and gee that's it\nBut he is the problem see like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy teen piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from protein yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins in our body different kinds of proteins so the question was like how how does all that get generated like\nHow did this for simple base has become the you know acids to become the hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us\nUs how do you make the transition ... people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved\nAnd the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ...\nThis\nOkay I Know the DNA is contains four bases ATC and GE and ... days somehow\nCreate hundreds of thousands of protein so I just need to think of a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nThe ACC Gigi ... and then out comes the protein what\nWhat simple toad could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out to side I think that ourselves read our genes three basis at a time\n[noise] like instead of eighty CGI ac ... thought maybe eighty eight 'cause he's he G.
