spoon and\nExcept for the diamond ring none of marks purchases had amounted to more than a few hundred dollars [noise] I totally all about the robbery\nAnd he said it would just take a minute to reset the stone salmon I waited while he got out his instruments and went to work we were making conversation chit chat nothing much um she said did I Know the diamond in the ... was a perfect stone I said march told me that\nShe said it wasn't the kind of diamond I'd ever have trouble selling if I ever wanted to see a told mark that he would be glad to buy it back for what mark had paid for it I said I was glad to hear that\nHe asked me how I like the necklace\n[noise]\nThe necklace I said\n[noise] uh Leo looked up and the loop dropped from his eye I must be thinking of another customer he\nSaid no no no you're not I said I knew mark had bought me some thing while I was in the hospital\nSo he had bought her a necklace for her birthday I was lying\nIn the hospital with a nose and he\nHad bought her a necklace no fat rascal I said\nOh I shouldn't have said anything real sag oh I'm Glad you did I said now\nI Know what to be prepared for there is nothing worse than opening a box with Nicholas

don't care what it is as long as it's not a suitcase\nWas my face red [laughter]\nLeo was focused on the ring again I board him so thoroughly he barely rented a response he finished resetting the stone and handed the ring back to me\nIt was such a beautiful rang the diamond caught the afternoon sun and\nMade a rainbow on the wall of the store Sam ran to the reflection and I waved to ring this way and that moving the rainbow while he giggled and left\nAnd tried to catch it in his hands\nHow much\nThey know how much for the ring I said\nHow much would you give me for the ring [noise] Leo looked at me um you don't really want to sell it he said oh no I really want to sell it [noise] I said do you really want to buy it\nOh of course he said oh I Love the ring Leo but it really just doesn't go with my life\nIt would never have been stolen in the first place if I hadn't been born this way and if you got a ring you can't wear on the so what's the point of having it\nIt's sort of like having a mink coat [noise] if I had a mean coach I Would have to take care of every time I'm In New York and the next thing you know we'd be even broker than we are now\nMarkets so romantic he probably spent every penny of his savings on a necklace Leo nodded for the down payment you\nSaid for the down payment I said it's a beautiful necklace said Leo [noise]\nNow have a beautiful necklace

Leo's checks and made the pie I was in a trance well I don't know perhaps it wasn't a trance but it was as close to his Tran says I'll ever get [noise] I was speechless I said nothing\nNothing at all for several hours [noise]\nAt age I'm Mark and I took the pi to ... it was just us um me mark Betty and Dimitri who bet he lives with [noise]\nWe got to Betty's mark and Dimitri went into the kitchen to boil the lobsters and Betty and I sat in the living room while that he talked about the dance that she in Selma and I were apparently giving apparently we were giving it at the ...\nHad already been booked apparently all that was lacking was my guess lift film and that he had already drawn upstairs and apparently the Kissinger Z or on film is lift justice I\nPredicted I sat\nAnd listens and drank an entire bottle of white wine as bad he went on and on and by the time I was tipsy we ate the lobsters I don't remember the conversation [noise] um I Do\nRemember realizing that no one seemed
