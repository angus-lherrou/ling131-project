[noise]\n\nYour bread men nodded not at what I said it seemed but at some unfathomable complex gain of interlocking events\nThe only dimly in adequately aware he trying to ... look on me\nHe said\nCathy would understand [noise]\nBefore I had a chance to digest this extraordinary remarks the boy assistant stepped up beside me threatening to close his face was flush them slit can smell the

whipped cream let's sit five minutes before serving\nI realize now that I should've thrown the pie or at least done the thinking that led to the throwing of the pie several weeks earlier than I did but it's very hard to throw a pie of someone when you're pregnant because you feel so vulnerable\nAlso let's face it I wasn't ready to throw the pie I should add\nThat the pie was hardly the first thing that I thought\nAbout throwing it mark but every other time I wanted to throw something Adam I couldn't bring myself to do it once for example right after I found out about him and Selma I'd been seized by a violent impulse but the only thing I could see to throw at the time was assigned ... chair and\nI Am far to boost walk to throw assigned to haunted anything at any one [noise] sometime later especially while I was in the hospital I gave considerable\nGood frying pan that I had bought at the bridge kitchen we our company but I always knew that I Would never do anything of the storage and in any case smashing your husband's head in with the frying pan seems slightly to fraud with feminist content if you know what I mean [noise]\nWell even now\nI Wonder if I Would have thrown the pie if we'd been eating in ... dining room probably not on the floor and Betty has dining room is a beautiful oriental rug and I would have been far too concerned about standing it fortunately though we were eating in the kitchen\nAnd the kitchen has a linoleum floor that is how bourgeois I Am at the\nSplit seconds I picked up the pie to throw it at mark at the split second I was about to do the bravest all the it's the most derivative thing that I've ever done in my life I thought to myself thank God the floors linoleum and can be wiped off [noise]\n\nSaturday afternoon Betty called I went out for a walk to buy the pie ingredients I took Sam with me we had a long talk about how ms Daniel would be coming home from the hospital on Monday and\nHow much Sam was gonna love him and how he was going to feed him some delicious spiders\nAnd we bought food names it was a beautiful day so we decided to walk down to the toy store\nOn M. street and on the way we passed the jewelry store\nWhere mark had bought me the diamond ring and I remember that I hadn't taken it in yet to have it fixed it was in a little ... in my purse\nI could see Leo Rothman the owner sitting on a stool behind the counter Leo [noise]\nThe deer white haired man who had marched with the Abraham Lincoln brigade in the thirties and been thrown out of the Labor Department in the forties was now a millionaire jeweler who buzz only white people through his electronically operated door\nShe buys me in and gave me a big kid when mark was courting main um when he was\nPursuing me with flowers and balloons and Jules Leo was demand that mark bought the jewels from and as a result Leal felt almost proprietary about our marriage\nHe and outfitted the courtship the wedding the birth of the first\nAnd she didn't seem to mind that except for the diamond ring none of marks purchases had amounted to more than a few hundred dollars [noise]\nI totally feel about the robbery\nAnd she said it would just take a minute to reset the stone salmon I waited while he got out his instruments and went to work we were making conversation chit chat nothing much [noise] um she said did I Know the diamond in the ... was a perfect stone I said march told me that\nSaid it wasn't the kind of diamond I'd ever have trouble selling if I ever wanted to see it told mark that he would be glad to buy it back for what mark had paid for it I said I was glad to hear that he asked me how I liked the necklace\n[noise]\nThe necklace I said\n[noise] uh\nLeo looked up and the loop dropped from his eye I must be thinking of another customer you said\nNo no no you're not I said I\nKnew mark had bought me some thing\nWhile I was in the hospital\nSo he had bought her a necklace for her birthday I was lying\nIn the hospital with a nose and he\nHad bought her a necklace no fat rascal\nI said oh I shouldn't have said anything we all said oh I'm Glad you did I said\nNow I Know what to be prepared for there is nothing worse than opening a box with Nicholas in it when you're\n[laughter] I kept talking I couldn't stop once I said I was in the mood for an eye out and mark kept dropping hints about what he got me for my birthday and finally I said I don't care what it is as long as it's not a suitcase\nWas my face red [laughter]\nLeo was focused on the ring again I board him so thoroughly he barely rented a response he finished resetting the stone and handed the ring back to me\nIt was such a beautiful rang the diamond caught the afternoon sun and\nMade a rainbow on the wall of the store Sam ran to the reflection and I waved to ring this way and that moving the rainbow while he giggled and left\nAnd tried to catch it in his hands\nWhen you contribute to double UCI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support double UCI at Cape and islands dot org\nFor the ring [noise]\nLeo looked at me um you don't really want to sell it he said oh no I really want to sell it [noise] I said do you really want to buy it oh of course he said oh I Love the ring Leo\nBut it really just doesn't go with my life it would never have been stolen in the first\nPlace if I hadn't been born this way and if you got to bring you can't wear on the what's the point of view I guess it's sort of like having a mink coat [noise] if I had a mean coach I Would have to take care of every time I'm In New York and the next thing you know we'd be even broker than we are now\nMarkets so romantic he probably spent every penny of his savings on a necklace [laughter] Leo nodded for the down payment\nYou said or the down payment I said it's a beautiful necklace said Leo [noise]\nNow have a beautiful necklace I won't be able to wear on the subway either I said how much for the ring Fifteen thousand Leo said Fifteen thousand I said\nThat's what mark paid for it they'll set my heart's started ... pounds I realize that I had just been given the means to walk out of my marriage\nFifteen thousand it is I said to Leo ten years had passed the cost of walking out of a marriage\nHad gone up\nI went home with Leo's checks and made the pie I was in a trance well I don't know perhaps it wasn't a trance but it was as close to it transcends all ever get I was\nSpeechless I said nothing nothing at all for several hours\n[noise] at age I'm Mark and I took the pie ... it was just us um me mark Betty and Dimitri who bet he lives with\nWhen we got to Betty's mark and Dimitri went into the kitchen to boil the lobsters and Betty and I sat in the living room while but he talked about the dance that she and Selma and I were apparently\nWe were giving it at the sole grave club apparently the crap man had already been booked apparently all that was lacking was my guess lift film and that he had already drawn upstairs and apparently the Kissinger is we're on film is lift justice I predicted\n\nI fats and listens and drank an entire bottle of white wine as bad he went on and on and by the time I was gypsy we ate the lobsters I don't remember the conversation [noise] um I Do\nRemember realizing that no one seems to be noticing that I hadn't said anything the entire evening and that no one seemed to mind\nI must try this again I thought I must try again someday to sit still and not say a word maybe when I'm dead [noise]", "year": "2018",
