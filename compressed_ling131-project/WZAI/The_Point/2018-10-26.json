station will be relocating it's spent fuel rods on site explain what the fuel rods are and what this means\nSure so fuel rods are essentially they're the part of the nuclear reactor that keep it going very thin metal rods they're filled with uranium and they're switched out at the end of their lifetime every now and again and they're called in a cold water pool and then they're placed in something that looks like a large concrete cylinder\nThis is called a dry cask storage unit to let the air call them afterwards the fuel rods are currently being kept on a pad in dry cask storage units um it's actually a large part of asphalt but it can't accommodate all the spent fuel rods at the plant will eventually generate so they're building a new ad\nUm the current had can only accommodate about thirty of these concrete dry cask storage units um but the new ... should be able to have room for what energy predicts will be a final number of sixty one task\nUm this is important because it could potentially be the final resting place of all these fuel rods for many many decades unless an offsite fuel location is five\nSo energy the owner of the building nuclear power station right now why this new location and what is it about the new location that offers something that the current location does enough [noise]\nSure yeah so energy wanted to know that they are not building a new pad because the current one was unsafe for in a bad location um though critics like Mary Lempert have noted that the current cat is fairly close to Cape Cod bay and could be at risk of being flooded during a bad storm or students sea level rise over the coming years\nNonetheless officials have chosen a sight to build their new larger had much higher up and further away from the bay it's about Seventy five feet above sea level and seven hundred feet from shore\nAh this was announced at a meeting of the advisory panel um the D. commissioning what was the reaction to this new citing for the

week I'm Steve Juncker joining me from the Cape cod times is Christian young in on the phone with us right now is Tim wood from the Cape cod chronicled good morning Jim good morning Steve\nWe've talked about how the town of Chatham is moving to create a task force to look at keeping younger families in town now the mandate for that task force appears to be broadening tells about this\n[noise] sure uh this this past Monday the or the board of slack men who are about three weeks ago um decided to ah established that task force you just mentioned well this past week after hearing a report from a couple of board members they decided that they were going to ah broaden the scope of the the\nCharge of that task force and instead of just looking at ways to keep young families in town they decided that they would uh include\nTrying to encourage a more sustainable year round population that includes all age groups not just young families a board is really a taking this uh situation seriously there's a lot of anecdotal evidence about uh both young people\nLeaving a leaving town because they just can't afford to stay here either because a housing costs are too high or are there are the jobs that they need to afford to live here\nAnd it ah that's been a sort of changing over the years not just include young families but even a but but older people and and also a elderly people who find that they can't maintain their homes\nOr any waiver board member a board chairman dean the Castro a a kind of a cap slated what he said uh\nIs that the concern here and he he believes that the viability of the community is really at stake and called this the town's number one priority\nUh now the town needs to find a way to make a living here year round more affordable or so that uh he's uh the Castro said we don't become a way he put it was we don't become a museum of it\nIt's clearly one of the main issues here is is housing um [noise] uh the backers of this idea of the task force plan have they've already branded it a a Chatham three sixty five [noise] and\nThey're kind of looking to a A N roll a nine to eleven people both residence and and people who work in town\nTo ah to recommend to look at the situation and recommend concrete actions to support a year round or\nA more viable year round community a lot of the likely focus is going to be jobs and housing as we've talked about in the past uh at both affordable housing in what's being referred to a recently as attainable housing\nWhich is a homes for for working people who make too much money to qualify for affordable housing\nAnd a lot of this a lot of it seems to run parallel to that housing assistance or corporations study that was released earlier this week which ah [noise] ah curiously enough ah focused a bit on the lower ... a town like Chatham which they say well uh\nUh feel the impact of the housing situation\nUh sooner and more severely than than the rest of the ... just because of the uh the season Audi and the lack of your own housing or already that exists um other focuses in Chatham that they've talked about uh for this task force includes a or something like ... year round childcare\nEither subsidized by the government or perhaps even free\nUh to uh to try to ah to a as an enticement for your own families are families to stay here year round and that's this is something that the town's economic development committee has support in the past has\nHas have uh the school department um there's already been a considerable amount of interest or by residents to serve on this task force\nAnd the the border sweating and is expected to start interviewing perspective numbers are pretty soon and uh with the goal of getting it going ah really as as soon as possible so will be will be keeping tabs on that and are reporting on how the progress\nTim London to Cape Cod chronicled pin thanks for joining us like he sticks with me in Studio ... Christian young from the Cape cod times Christian surfing community and others turned out over the weekend for\nMemorial event honoring the young man killed by a shark\nLast month yes over a hundred

happened um pleasant village it resort and ... and a local surfer donated accommodations for him to each his relatives stop and shop contributed baskets of flowers and pastries and Dunkin' Donuts also provided coffee and doughnuts for the event which\nFor a lot of myths each his relatives this was the first time that they had actually been back to the beach where this happened and and you know saw the place where we need to really it's told them that he he knew the dangers and he's still like to come he was a passionate\nI'm a surfer and a body border which has is what he was doing on that day um some of his relatives spoke at the memorial and I'm a including ... who whose sister Emily was actually engage Timothy chi and vocal was in the water body boarding with muddy chi when he was attacked by the shark and\nWhat he said on the day on his ... speaking to teach you you said you've given me a friendship you have been the Brotherhood and you taught me how to live life to the fullest I'm In his aunt ... who who was there for the first time that they said that um the ceremony hadn't really helped her\nThat she hadn't had a lot of time to sort of process by the time and she had been busy with a range meant sending the ditches body back to Brazil where he's from and where his parents still live and that\nThis is one of the first time she she really got to process things and and uh that it it really helped her quite a bit\nAnd surfers took to the water and formed a giant ring as many as ... observers\nYes they did they um they somewhere tossing flowers on the water they went out on the surface in ... went out there they formed a circle and they held hands and formed a floating circle to attribute muddy um they also called him sort of part of their community they said that he was part of their community now and that he always\nWould be um and um you know and I think his his family members took solace and that as\nI mentioned before I'm ... spoke about how much she had told him that day that he loved this place that this was his happy place and um and he feels that that you know when when this happened that he was doing something that he loved\nMe as well as another impact of the shark attack Orleans officials are offering training on how to stop the loss of blood after a short [noise]\nSo there was a stop to lead a training session this week that was hosted by the Atlantic white shark conservancy at their center on a route twenty and I'm Sorry that was actually last week and it was attended by various officials who you know sort of have roles related to um the natural resources share Orleans natural resources manager and Ethan Sears was there he\nSaid he founded surreal you know that that this is sort of uh\nThat you know there were two people who were bitten by sharks this summer including the D G um and that the presence of so many sharks close to the water and the sightings of so many sharks close to the water has really increased so rapidly in the past few years\nUm to him he said that he didn't feel the risk was worth the reward but that they'll always be people who are going to go out there and they're going to start born ... no matter what the risk as he said for them it's a way of life and so they stopped the training is really a way to address that and to help people who might be in the water and and you know one day find that they need that sort of help um\nIt's a it's a one of the some of the things that they were saying to do is to really make sure you got the victim to the beach quickly to cut away the wet suit in any clothing near the wound to determine the extent of bleeding and the size of the injury\nAnd that really that first step should be to have someone call nine one one tiny Israeli of the essence here I'm so these workshops are also going to be continued throughout the fall and possibly over the winter and um they're aiming to train up to two hundred people before next summer\nAnd or or leans I Know they're considering putting ... kids on the beach or at least and perhaps ... beach\nYes so EMTs already travel these trauma kits in their vehicles on even on their off duty I guess with\nAnd what they include our latex gloves God's trauma shares on end tourniquets that can be used in when needed to stop the bleeding which is really the whole point but they also said that even if the kids aren't available and and the as you mentioned they are going to be making an effort Orleans is considering having at least one child care available at a kiosk\nOn ... beach and that that people can do this for things like towels or clothing or a God on it they can stuff that into the wound and put direct pressure at the site of the injury to help stop the bleeding\nUm and earned his Dee Dee while he was in the army he came out as a gay man at the age of Thirteen and got beat up a lot and might have been a reason for his behavioral problems here\nUm you know who knows anyway I'm after getting out of the army he started working in the ... in computers as his sister said and ended up working for the Pentagon\nUm he sold a his own computer company in the eighties and when he was diagnosed with aids and\nAt that point he either moved to New York or the province town and he's really been in problems town for you know basically decades and so it's very I don't know to me that's

thirty of the concrete dry cask storage units um but the new ...\nShould be able to have room for what energy predicts will be a final number of sixty widen cats\nUm this is important because it could potentially be the final resting place of all these fuel rods for many many decades unless an offsite fuel location if I'd had five\nSo energy the owner of the building nuclear power station right now why this new location what is it about the new location didn't offer something that the current location doesn't have [noise]\nSure yeah so energy want you to know that they are not building a new path because the current one was unsafe for in a bad location um though critics like Mary Lambert have noted that the current had is fairly close to Cape Cod bay and could be at risk of being flooded during a bad storm or students\nNonetheless officials have chosen a sight to build their new larger pat much higher up and further away from the bay it's about Seventy five feet above sea level and seven hundred feet from shore\nAh this was announced at a meeting of the advisory panel on the D commissioning what was the reaction to this new citing for the fuel rods\nUm yeah a lot of people were pleasantly surprised by the decision even Jim Lambert the husband very Lambert and critic of the Clinton himself has said he did not expect to attend the meeting and to hear that but that

Steve Juncker joining me from the Cape cod times is Christian young in on the phone with us right now is Tim wood from the Cape cod chronicle good morning Jim good morning Steve\nWe've talked about how the town of Chatham is moving decreed task force to look at keeping younger families in town now the mandate for that task force appears to be broadening tell us about this\nSure uh [noise] this this past Monday the or the board of slack men who are about three weeks ago um decided to ah established that task force you just mentioned while this past week um after hearing a report from a couple of board members\nThey decided that they were going to ah broaden the scope of the the charge of that task force and instead of just looking at ways to keep young families in town they decided that they would uh include\nA trying to encourage a more sustainable year round population that includes all age groups not just young families\nA board is really a taking this uh situation seriously there's a lot of anecdotal evidence about\nAh both young people leaving a leaving town because they just can't afford to stay here either because a housing costs are too high or are there are the jobs that they need to afford to live here\nAnd it uh that's been a sort of changing over the years not just include young families but even a but but older people and and also a elderly people who find that they can't maintain their homes or anyway\nDean the Castro a kind of a cap slated what he said uh [noise] is the concern here and he he believes that the viability of the community is really at stake and called this or that the town's number one priority\nUh now the town needs to find a way to make a living here year round more affordable or so that uh he uh the Castro said we don't become a way he put it was we don't become a museum of expensive homes\nAnd that's clearly one of the main issues here is is housing um [noise] uh the backers of this idea or the task force plan have uh they've already branded it a a Chatham three sixty five [noise]\nAnd they're kind of looking to a A N roll a nine to eleven people both residence and and people who work in town to ah to recommend to look at the situation and recommend concrete actions to support a year round or\nA more viable year round community a lot of the likely focus is going to be jobs and housing as we've talked about in the past ah at both affordable housing and what's being referred to a recently as attainable housing\nWhich is a homes for for working people who make too much money to qualify for affordable housing and a lot of this a lot of this seems to run parallel to that housing assistance or corporation study that was released earlier this week which ah [noise]\nCuriously enough ah focused a bit on the lower Cape towns like Chatham which they say well uh uh feel the impact of the housing situation\nOr sooner and more severely than than the rest of the Cape just because of the uh\nThe season out in the lack of your own housing or already that exists I'm\nNo other focuses in Chatham that they've talked about uh for this task force include a\nOr something like ... year round childcare either subsidized by the government or perhaps even free uh to uh to try to ah to a as an enticement for your own families are families to stay here year round and that's this is something that the town's economic development committee has support in the past has\nHas have ah the school department\nUm there's already been a considerable amount of interest or by residents to serve on this task force\nAnd the at the border selected is expected to start interviewing perspective numbers are up pretty soon and uh with the goal of getting it going ah really as as soon as possible so will be will be keeping tabs on that and are reporting on how they ah progress\nTim one to decay God chronicle\nYou do with me in the studios Christ in young from the Cape cod times Christ into surfing community

happened um pleasant grove village it resort in Chatham\nAnd a local surfer donated accommodations for him to each his relatives\nStop and shop contributed baskets of flowers and pastries and Dunkin' Donuts also provided coffee and doughnuts for the event\nWhich for a lot of men to each his relatives this was the first time that they had actually been back to the beach where this happened and and you know saw saw the place where did you really it's told them that he he knew the dangers and he's still like to come he was a passionate\nI'm a surfer and a body border which has is what she was doing on that day um some of his relatives spoke at the memorial and I'm a including ... who whose sister Emily was actually engage Timothy chi and vocal was in the water body boarding with muddy chi when he was attacked by the shark and\nWhat he said on the day on his ... speaking to teach you you said you've given me a friendship you can the Brotherhood and you taught me how to live life to the fullest I'm In his aunt ... who who was there for the first time that they said that um the ceremony has really helped her that she hadn't had a lot of time to sort of process by the time and she had been busy\nWith a range meant sending the ditches body back to Brazil where he's from and where his parents still live and that\nThis is one of the first time she she really got to process things and and that it it really helped her quite a bit\nAnd surfers to to the water and formed a giant ring as many as I think read those observers\nYes they did they um they some were tossing flowers on the water as they went out on the surface in ... went out there they formed the circle and they held hands and formed a floating circle to attribute muddy chi um they also called him sort of part of their community they said that he was part of their community now and that he always\nWould be um [noise] and um you know and I think that his his family members took solace and that as\nI mentioned before I'm ... spoke about how much she had told him that day that he loves this place that this was his happy place and um and he feels that that you know when when this happened that he was doing something that he loved\nMe as well as another impact of the shark attack Orleans officials are\nStop the loss of blood after shark attack [noise]\nYes so there was a stop to bleed a training session this week that was hosted by the Atlantic white shark conservancy at their center on a route twenty and I'm Sorry that was actually last week and it was attended by various officials who you know sort of have rules related to um the natural resources share Orleans natural resources manager Nathan's yours was there he\nSaid he founded surreal you know that that that's the sort of escalated so quickly\nThat you know there were two people who were bitten by sharks this summer including the D G um and that the presence of so many sharks close to the water and the sightings of so many sharks close to the water has really increased so rapidly in the past few years\nUm [noise] to him he said that he didn't feel the risk was worth the reward but that they'll always be people who are going to go out there and they're going to start born ... no matter what the risk as he said for them it's a way of life and so this ... is really a way to address that and to help people who might be in the water and and you know one day find that they need that sort of help um [noise]\nUh so one of some of the things that they were saying to do is to really make sure you get the victim to the beach quickly um to cut away the wet suit in any clothing near the boon to determine the extent of the leading in the size of the injury and that really that first step should be to have someone call nine one one that\nTiming is really of the essence here I'm so these workshops are also going to be continued throughout the fall and possibly over the winter and um they're aiming to train up to two hundred people before next summer on\nAnd uh we're leans I Know they're considering putting problem with kids on the beach or at least and perhaps ... beach\nYes so EMTs already travel\nThese trauma kits and their vehicles on even on the off duty I guess with and what they include our latex gloves God's trauma shares on end tourniquets that can be used in when needed to stop the bleeding which is really the whole point but they also said that even if trauma kits aren't available and and the as you mentioned they are going to be making an effort Orleans is considering having\nAt least one trauma kid available at a kiosk\nOn ... beach and that but people can do this but things like towels or clothing or God's on it they can stuff that into the wound and put direct pressure at the side of the injury to help stop the bleeding\nUm and earned his GED while he was in the army he came out as a gay man at the age of Thirteen and got beat up a lot and might have been a reason for his behavioral problems\nHere um you know who knows anyway I'm after getting out of the army he started working in the ... in computers as his sister said and ended up working for the Pentagon\nUm he sold a his own computer company in the eighties and when he was diagnosed with aids and at that point he either moved to New York or the province town and he's really been in problems town for you know basically

accusations were made during what was described as intense debate earlier this month in which floor is accused of doing the bidding of insurance the insurance industry and endangering the lives of children especially in some toddlers through recent legislation that he sponsored um the claim that fear\nWas influenced by the insurance industry and accepted money from special interest groups appears to be unfounded the bill that ... year filed as defended by state officials lead poisoning experts and pediatricians as good legislation that offers more protection for children\nUm it's an

five micrograms per ... leader of\nLead in a child's blood to prompt mandatory home inspection and let abatement activity well a level of ten to twenty five micrograms protects the leader triggers outreach and offers for educational assistance and other assistance from the health department Sears still lowers the threshold to ten\nAnd five micrograms per desolate are respectively and that would mean more children would qualify for intervention programs at lower levels on he said that the lower threshold or a foot in the door for stronger laws in the future but the special interests would have killed the bill if levels of concern were identified at levels below five micrograms protest leaders\nAnd how about the accusations that had taken money from some of these special interests\nSo Sears office produced a list of lobbyists campaign donations from firms that might be connected to industry is with an interest in the lead poisoning legislation\nAnd there were only for donors that
