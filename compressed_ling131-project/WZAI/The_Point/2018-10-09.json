I really like ... or losing birders always really love turning went up because they're kind of tough\nA couple of turned up at a suit against banding station they're annoying island we've had them um we've had at least one at the sanctuary in wealth fleet at our banding station\nAlways always a fun one to see but they're just sort of um yellow eat like a drab yellow we green a kind of agree\nThe nice looking a little bird speaking this thanks for what would we have a lot of things going on at the ... not a great spot to kind of just go inside that little area there where you can look out to the feeders and see all kinds of stuff [noise]\nUh yeah that no this actually is always good I mean we um it's been particularly good the last couple of weeks for\nUm turns and wading birds so at the sanctuary willfully we have this ... creek um that kind of empties out at rates were our beaches if you go hiking trails out to our beaches creek or there's creeks on either side of our beach kind of emptying out there and so on a falling tied\n'em there have been a lot of shorebirds if at some interesting ones I cut Sony and God wait a couple of still sand bikers red knots have been regular and they are typically not regular at AARP each red knots these long distance migrants on their way to\nCheer on running these [laughter]\nI'll take obscure brood calls for two hundred Alex [laughter]\nAh [laughter] I don't even know what that was [laughter]\nThat was the red knot okay it's should do that they're not they're not super vocal when they come through here some of these shorebirds that you know they have songs on the Arctic these high Arctic breeding grounds that I have not been to um [noise]\nBut anyway ... oh and lots of herons and eager to you know stuff that ... people people can can get behind being charismatic birds that even have you know people who aren't hardcore birders can certainly get into I mean you could see twenty five thirty ... several great eager it's all kind of lined up in the creek with\nHundreds of laughing goals and uh we have tons of forced to return which is kind of a specialty bird of ours this time of year you might see a hundred and eight hundred a hundred and fifty four stirs turns on a good day in most places even good burning spots I can chat um you typically don't see any you're just see a couple\nAnd they don't breathe in Massachusetts I'm not even sure where they come from whether they come up from the south to stage here before they migrate or they're coming from like an upper Midwest population\nI'm Still kind of a mystery so Forrester Stearns there's still common turns around and so there's these feeding frenzy is a bird feeding on fish these creeks are emptying out on the dropping tied\nUh it's it's been really nice so yeah the sanctuary is really nice this time of year too good good shoulder season thing to do yeah kind of like our trail ... see a new exhibit check out our banding station Sunday mornings you can do

at night and identified them from Cornell bird sounds and from their planned attack on the ... in my outdoor shower\nThey were using Cornell so called milling sound in the planning which was a sound I'd never heard than swooped up into the shower happily for me they took the whole nest I report this because there were fires in Colorado that year and this year there were fires in Colorado as well so far\nTo fly a greasy distances to escape the fire boy or what [laughter] and God's name ... el filed where where does this person who has not say where\nI don't know what to do with that al ... breed in the desert southwest I used to have I used to work uh do research in the\nDesert southwest I I Love that area is awesome birding awesome wildlife and it was one of ... point of pride that we had an el foul um I Lived in the cotton wood forests at the edge of the desert 'em down there and just kind of wilderness area we had ... there but\nUh yeah I don't know\nOutside shower ... el fouls I don't know what\nI don't know where she she didn't say if that was out west somewhere if that was here but anyway that I Know I certainly know wealthy in alpha\nNoel files here yeah I don't know it was a miss identification or they didn't say that they actually live in Arizona I don't know we'll\nTake last now is that something I Would do any kind of\nYou know I don't I don't know of el fouls would do that I mean some of the small um owls are opportunistic and uh they'll they prefer to eat mice um like like screech owls will eat insects they'll eat moths and beetles and things certainly\nUm as an all out west the foil emulate it out that I think is pretty insect diverse\nUm but I don't know about al ... and ... and they don't know I don't know I don't know with that\nWith that one I hey I'm we should talk about West Nile this been tough year for some crows right crow crow is the only do any of the birds\nYeah I mean ... you know ... are both cords during that family and that they're closely related you know ravens presumably it would be susceptible but there's been some talk I'm kind of around here that people are seeing dead crows\nAnd I'm sure it's West Nile virus and then Jay's you know where it was an influx of Jay's I think we might talk about that later but\nUm yeah they get it too and so it's probably heard it's a big west Nile virus year and they use to test birds but they don't anymore they don't they don't want the state doesn't want dead birds to test they found that it doesn't work as well as testing the mosquitoes\nAnd so don't you know they just said bury it it's safe to just you know buried in your yard if you do have\nDead birds um they know about it it's a thing you know I'd say\nSeventeen or Eighteen years ago there was a major West Nile outbreak certainly within bird populations that that really um knocked crow population\nProbably around here to not so much on the outer Cape but I'm definitely off Cape and like Bristol county leaders of the crew numbers were weighed down because of West Nile virus and took a long time to recover [noise]\nUm and so maybe we're reaching that point in the cycle again and and they're going to take another hit but means to be seen but don't you know just ... um you don't need to call anybody I'm\n... right now I Would just they don't they don't want to test your dead birds they know about this West Nile out there and so you could just just Marriott right Joan is calling from east tire which Hi Joan\nGood morning on Sunday I was coming back from Orleans along ... twenty eight and a south ... just past ... road is a dip in the road and uh by the bay and there was standing in the middle of the road\nAnd standing up Paul this is around noon or maybe one o'clock\nIt was a tall skinny grade duck and the traffic came to a halt in both directions thankfully and some lady finally gave up I got out of our current headed towards it and it's oh no and it ran across it in front of a migraine\nAnd turned around and took off it flew out over the bay but it was a tall skinny gray duck I have no idea what that could possibly be I was five cars back so I couldn't see it that clearly\nTall skinny greed duck you sure to duck walk ducks whack like I didn't hear it asked you questions are\nYeah I don't know I it took months or so cute though I mean they're just oh I I Love chicken I John is giving us a call ... from the high end as well watch good morning John\nHi good morning guys out there on figured I [noise]\nI figured I'd give a holler here because it's probably our last report from the water well because I won't be out there okay or after after about the twenty six so um our birds have been our birds have been good spend the best birds we've had the past uh three weeks or so for the whole season for us are some of our uh\nShare waters like ... which we hadn't seen many outlaw sorry I've come in and good\nNumbers and plenty plenty of\nKorea share waters but we're starting to get some of our [noise] our fall specialties here where she and a lotta a lotta parents died at ... we had a couple of Palm Springs further offshore and one south polar school that was that was fun\nYou know very rarely nice bird that is a nice burger and we we\nPicked up the brown will be the other day too low floating around still wagon so that was exciting as well\nReally in some form Mars yeah they haven't seen any reports that's really nice yeah I haven't seen any reaction that Maui\nSplendor you know and then with us and Ghana which makes it a lot easier because there's so much\nSmaller right now yeah very nice but um\nThe other day or mentioned in migration and we had as we often do we had a desperate little songbirds circling off on stole wagging by circling our boat\nAnd as we always do encourage people you know if it lands on you let it it's are tired bird that came down from all the way from Canada probably last night across the whole Gulf of Maine\nMm yeah no they had a little bit and it's one of the fun things this time of year as these these songbirds that end up out over the water that will end up on boats and it just shows you what they're going through a tiny little birds and you think about where it came from or how far it's flown over water and how much further it has to go which it's just amazing what about\nRenters in this case it in in this case it was a little Nashville or Blair and a\nAnd R passenger um\nScooped it and it's hot I didn't know that he's done at the time I Would have a kind of have to let nature take its course out there but he put it in his attitude if we and we gave it a ride back and [laughter] I only discovered this when I went down to secure a boat for\nGetting people often the bird was flying in our cabin so here you know so we we quickly quickly got 'em tucked away and with the aid of about a three um\nThree of our youngest passengers on board between about four and six years old we\nWe all went out and let it go um you know a couple of them didn't speak English as their first language or any English and it was fun because you could see there was a real um universal joy and monitoring this little\nTired little bird fly right into the um you know shrubbery and and and probably get right to the the the job of feeding itself for the rest\nYeah here's a trip they won't forget yeah no not at\nAll what they call that ship assisted migration do they do I mean it did happen to some ... ... the big snowy owl ruptured years several years ago they documented that some snowy owls ended up on a boat bound for Europe\nAnd so they took a boat from Canada to Europe and then they watch them fly a onto the mainland Europe on this boat so she persisted birds is a thing\nKen what about the whales how's how's it been for whale watching\nIt has been an odd gear and I think we spoke about that before just because of our prey base we had an ... number of Sandy hills but I'm a lot of our whales have moved on and now we're starting to see some of our um\nWe're starting to see a lot of the humpback so we expect to see how are are moving out slowly um they're they're getting they're getting picky or on the times that they see they're they're not waste and ...\nThere are only feeding so it's there's whales out there that are often do in deep dies and we're seeing a lot of individuals that ... that we associate more with the northern Gulf of Maine Wales which normally would be spotted up toward ... off a bar harbour off of\nNova Scotia or further up so it's an exciting time yeah those are chose this that's that's come up by the boat [laughter]\nYeah well John thanks for that report we appreciate that and so we were going on I Will want to see the birds yeah\nOh abs young absolutely absolutely good times we'll hope to speak to where it will be back in touch and in April\nYou bet thank you for your call John appreciate it eight six

their track of where they should be migrating they should be migrating south as well not to Cape Cod\nBut as lark bunting I'm pretty obscure bird for your average person a but some birders found this guy just hopping around in the road up at ... harbor this is a bird you would see like in the grasslands of Colorado you know out there and the grassy parts of the mountain west\nAnd a male a breeding mail is a gorgeous bird like black with this big white wing patch a really interesting sparrows have winter and summer of ... which is which is not typical for most sparrows\nThat we tend to see these kind of drab or looking ones that you know look like a big sparrow people like oh ... yeah but ah but a really interesting bird and you know like the seventh I think record ever for Massachusetts so obviously very rare I mean we have such a long history of people documenting birds and Massachusetts so to say it's the seventh record that's\nThat's up there with the with the really rare rare of the rare ... um but it's continued and\nUm you know there's some traditional hot spots where you go to look for these things especially on the outer Cape there's high had in ...\nUm and then you know Fort hill in east ham is always just full of things and and they have come through people found western king birds you probably people might be familiar with our eastern king bird which is a black and white bird that's here breathing in the summer they're kind of fun they chase things around the chase crows and they're really aggressive [noise]\nUm but the king birds out west and west or from the Rocky Mountains and west\nLook very different than ours and we get them just about every year they'll turn up here for some reason and there were two at high had sitting on the wires birders found those\nI'm at in Fort hill just bells Villarreal larks barrel all again all you know ... come as far as the mid west as close as the mid west but\nI'm just so many birds that don't don't belong here just turning up until there's more out there the point is there's there's more of these out there I guarantee hounds and solitaire down by the lighthouse it at ... another Rocky Mountain bird\nEven after all this time of you know weren't logical study they're one of those ones that we still have a lot of question marks about and that gives them an air of mystery to me I ... I really like ... or losing birders always really love turning went up because they're kind of tough\nA couple of turned up at a suit against banding station they're annoying island we've had them at um we've had at least one at the sanctuary in wealth week at our banding station\nAlways always a fun one to see but they're just sort of um yellow eat like a drab yellowish green a kind of a ... and a complete I rang ... um the nice looking little bird\nSpeaking this thanks for what would we have a lot of things going after ... another great spot to kind of just go inside that little area there where you can look out to the feeders and see all kinds of stuff [noise]\nUh yeah that no the sanctuary is always good I mean we um it's been particularly good the last couple of weeks for um turns and wading birds so at the sanctuary wealth we we have this ... creek\nUm that kind of empties out at right we're our beaches if you go hiking trails out to our beaches creek or there's creeks on either side of our beach kind of emptying out there and so on a falling tied\n'em there have been a lot of shorebirds some interesting ones like Sony and God wait a couple of still sand papers red knots have been regular and they're typically not regular at our beach red knots these long distance migrants on their way to\nSharon Sharon running these [laughter]\nI'll take obscure brood calls for two hundred Alex [laughter]\n[laughter] I don't even know what that was [laughter] that was the red knot of get it says you know that they're not they're not super vocal when they come through here some of these shorebirds that you know they have\nSongs on the Arctic these high Arctic breeding grounds that I have not been to um [noise]\nBut anyway ... oh and lots of herons and eager to you know stuff that ... people people can can get behind being charismatic birds that even now have you know people who aren't hardcore birders can certainly get into I mean you could see twenty five thirty ... several great eager it's all kind of lined up in the creek with\nHundreds of laughing goals and uh we have tons of ... which kind of a specialty bird of ours this time of year you might see a hundred and hundred a hundred and fifty four stirs turns on a good day in most places even good burning spots I can chat um you typically don't see any are you just see a couple\nAnd they don't breathe in Massachusetts I'm not even sure where they come from whether they come up from the south\nOr they're coming from like an upper Midwest population\nUm it's still kind of a mystery so Forrester Stearns there's still common turns around and so there's these feeding frenzy is a bird's feeding on fish these creeks are emptying out on the dropping tide\nOf it's it's been really nice so yeah that ... really nice this time of year too good shoulder season thing to do yeah kind of like our ... year new exhibit check out our banding station Sunday mornings you can do public banding demonstrations and uh we've other bird watching things come check it out\nIt's bird news with mark ... eight six six nine nine nine for six to six where your comments questions or stories that's eight

nine\nIs the point at Cape and islands dot org Marcia since email she says I'm so many years ago Nineteen Ninety nine I had health I was in my yard heard them at night and identified them from Cornell bird sounds and from their planned attack on the ... and my outdoor shower\nThey were using Cornell's so called milling sound and the planning which was a sound I'd never heard that swept up into the shower happily for me they took the whole mess I report this because there were fires in Colorado that year and this year there were fires in Colorado as well so perhaps the western birds stay on their latitudes but fly\nA greasy distances to escape the fire\nBoy or what [laughter] God's name ... el fouled where where does this person that has not say where I don't know what to do with that elbows breathe in the desert southwest I used to have I used to work uh do research in the\nDesert southwest I I Love that area is awesome birding awesome wildlife and it was one of ... point of pride and we had an el foul um I Lived in the cotton wood forests at the edge of the desert 'em down there and just kind of wilderness area we had ... there but\nUh yeah I don't know\nOutside shower ... el fouls I don't know\nWhat yeah I don't know where she shouldn't say that was out west somewhere if that was here\nBut anyway I don't I mean they will scene in alpha ... here and I don't know it was a miss identification or they didn't say that they actually live in Arizona I don't know we'll\nTake last night is is that something I Would do any kind of\nYou know I don't I don't know avail fouls would do that I mean some of the small um owls are opportunistic and a little they prefer to eat mice um like like screech owls will eat insects do eat moths and beetles and things certainly\nUm there's an old out west the foil emulated out that I think is pretty insect diverse\nUm but I don't know about al ... and ... and I don't know I\nDon't know I don't know I with that with that one I hey I'm we should talk about West Nile this has been tough year for some crows right ... our crew was the only do any of the birds\nJamie ... you know ... are both ... there in that family and they're they're closely related you know ravens presumably would be susceptible but there's been some talk I'm kind of around here that people are seeing it grows\nAnd I'm sure it's West Nile virus and then Jay's you know where it was an influx of geez I think we might talk about that later but um yeah they get it\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support double UCI at Cape and islands data word\nWas testing the mosquitoes and so don't you know they just said bury it it's safe to just you know buried in your yard if you do have\nDead birds um they know about it it's a thing you know I'd say Seventeen or Eighteen years ago there was a major West Nile outbreak certainly within bird populations that that really um knocked ... off Cape\nProbably around here to not so much on the outer Cape but I'm definitely off Cape and like we're still county places have grown numbers were way down because of West Nile virus and took a long time to recover [noise]\nUm and so maybe we're reaching that point in the cycle again and and they're going to take another hit but remains to be seen but don't you know just ... um you don't need to call anybody I'm\n... right now I Would just they don't they don't want to test your dead birds they know about this West Nile out there and so you could just just bury it yep Hi Joan is calling from east tire which Hi Joan\nGood morning on Sunday I was coming back from Orleans along were twenty eight and a south ... just past ... road there's a dip in the road and uh by the bay and they were standing in the middle of the road\nAnd standing up Paul this is around noon or maybe one o'clock\nIt was a tall skinny gray duck and the traffic came to halt in both directions thankfully and some lady finally gave up I got out of our current headed towards it and it's oh no and it ran across it in front of a migraine\nAnd turned around and took off it flew out over the bay but it was a tall skinny great duck I have no idea what that could possibly be I was five cars back so I couldn't see it that clearly\nTall skinny gray duck you sure about a duck due to walk ... [laughter] [laughter] I didn't hear it ask your question a\nStanding up tall and straight out any you know when it when it took off you know ran in front of the other cars out to fight it they call it ...\nI don't know I it took months or so cute though I mean they're just oh I I don't like John is giving us a call John from the high end as well watch good morning John\nHi good morning guys out there on figured I'd\nI figured I'd give our air because it's probably our last report from the water well because I won't be out there okay uh after after about the ... so um our birds have been ... our birds have been good spend the best birds we've had the past uh three weeks or so for the whole season for us are\nSome of our\nShare waters waxes which we hadn't seen many outlaw sorry I've come in and good numbers and plenty plenty of\nWe are false specialties here we're seeing a lotta a lotta a parasitic ... we've had a couple of hammering further offshore and one south polar school that was that was fun\nYou know very rarely nice bird\nThat is a nice burger and we we picked up the brown movie the other day to who's or\nAround stow wagon so that was exciting as well really in some form Mars\nYeah they haven't seen any reports that's really nice yeah I haven't seen any ...\nMouthing me in a you full full splendor you know and then with some Ghana which makes it a lot easier because there's so much smaller right now yeah very nice but um the other day or\nMentioned in migration and we had as we often do we had a desperate little songbirds circling off on still lagging bang circling our boat\nAnd as we always do we encourage people you know just if it lands on you lead editor tired bird that came down from all the way from Canada probably last night across the whole Gulf of Maine\nMm yeah no there's a little bit and it's one of the fun things this time of year is these these songbirds that end up out over the water that will end up on boats and uh it just shows you what they're going through a tiny little birds and you think about where it came from or how far it's flown over water and how much further than us to go which\nIt's just amazing what about what is in this\nCase it in in this case it was a little Nashville or Blair and and our passenger um\nScooped it and it's hot I didn't know that he's done at the time I Would have kind of have to let nature take its course out there but he put it in his attitude if way and we gave it a ride back and [laughter] I only discovered this when I went down to secure a boat for\nGetting people often the bird was flying in our cabin so yeah you know so when we quickly quickly Adam tucked away and with the aid of about a three um\nThree of our youngest passengers on board between about four and six years old we we all went out and\nLet it go um you know a couple of them didn't speak English as their first language or any English and it was fun because you could see there was a real um universal joy and monitoring it was a little tired little bird fly right into the um you know shrubbery and and and probably get right to the the the job of feeding itself for the rest\nYeah there's a trip they won't forget yeah no not at all what they hold that ship assisted migration [laughter] no they do I mean they do I did you did happen to some ... ... the big snow we all are ruptured years several years ago they documented that some snowy owls ended up on a boat bound for Europe\nAnd so they took a boat from Canada to Europe and then they watch them\nWrong on this boat so it should be assisted birds is a thing John what about the whales how's how's it been for whale watching\n[noise] it has been an odd year I think we spoke about that before just because of our ... number of sand deals but a lot of our whales have moved on and now we're starting to see some of our um\nWe're starting to see a lot of the humpback so we had expect to see how are are moving out slowly um they're they're getting they're getting pickier on the times that they feed their they're not wasted energy at this point they're almost took our quota and\nThere are only feeding so it's there's whales out there that are often do in deep dies and we're seeing a lot of individuals that ... that we associate more with the northern Gulf of Wales which normally would be spotted up toward ... off a bar harbour off of Nova Scotia further up so it's an exciting time\nYeah on our toes 'cause that's that's that's come up by the boat [laughter]\nYeah well John thanks for that report we appreciate that and so we were going on I Will want to see the birds yeah\nOh abs young absolutely absolutely good times right up to speak ill or whatever it will be back in touch and in April\nYou bet thank you called Joey

eight on double you ca I [noise]\nYou're listening to the point it's a bird news with mark Verde science coordinator at mass Audubon twelve leap a wildlife sanctuary eight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number that's eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org and Marshall wrote back\nUm about the ... she says I live in ... since it was night I could only hear them so looked up insect eating ours because it was at night and identified them from their bird sounds\nUm she's so you're not the first to dismiss the idea but I figure you're familiar with ... ... ... ... the point is how far will birds migrate from fire as perhaps the rare western marks have\n[noise] um no I don't think that's what's happening I'm ... ... it's more whether based like um wins bringing them because this was a time of year when they would be migrating not fleeing fire and so I think this is a typical thing where birds get off track\n'em prevailing winds will pick you know take them off course or\nOr um a lot of them just have something wrong and they're navigational systems they're kind of\nUm inborn navigational systems um and you'll get birds that fly a hundred and eight you know Ninety degrees in the wrong direction and things like that to mirror image errors in in migration\nUm spend a lot of lot of old pining about about what that is in terms of fleeing fires 'em a lot of birds actually are attracted fly into fire I recently recently burned areas green up again very very quickly and then you'll get a flush of\nEnergy insects um and there are birds that um there was some woodpeckers that I'm In insects that are able to detect fires long distances are in some insects that will fly to a fire\nBecause they can then take advantage of the fire weaken trees and lay their eggs and their larvae will eat the trees and in that attracts certain woodpeckers like black back woodpeckers they love to be and recently burned areas so um fires off in a kind of a short term attract and um for a lot of species of bird you know they can certainly big fires that\nYou know in areas where there was too much fuel and they hadn't been burned in a long time because of sort of mismanaging the landscape you know those can be devastating\nFor certain species um but also there there are other species that that will will benefit from it and buyers always been a natural part of the landscapes\n... you know pine dominated woodland these are fire I'm fire maintained ecosystems and so the animals and the birds involved with\nThat too and changing the subject him talk about spiders um I my in my grandson's bedroom we have this great big beautiful spider that's been there ... want to say for a couple of months now we've been watching and it's I mean it's it's it's really great because\nHe had mentioned that he wakes up with nightmares and so I said oh you know maybe in need of a dream catcher\nAnd he said you said you know what a dream catcher's yes catches bad dreams and we that was the day we had discovered the spider Web and window so I we came home and I looked up on line I founded dream catcher that kind of looked like a spider Web with this but I don't know I said look at this dream catcher this looks just like our spider Web in your window I think that is your dream catcher\nSo essentially done I Know right and then I said so what do you think is going to happen\nWhen that spider Web catches your bad dreams what's that spider going to do and he said he's going to eat it any really hungry [laughter] well he's gotten I think it's a she she has gotten much bigger Jewish and we it's been exciting for him to watch her catch these little insects and wrapped the you know and then the Web\nBut um it is I'm pretty sure it's across or believer which I'd never heard of before\nYeah I saw the affair and I'm not a spider I have to look up every spider just about and I I Know where to look but it's it's challenging I'd send people to bug guide dot net", "show_name": "The Point", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "09"}
