if it's a finished up threads on and start there\nThe big issue [noise] try to start with something you hold in common to gardening is I mean life is full of wonderful things is that a group you belong to the bowling I don't know is it um is it is it your children is it your grandchildren is it nature is\nFine and start their mhm because I Do believe deeply inside we want to connect with just forgotten how because we are mired in fear\nAnd you're saying to you if you're coming into this conversation with your defenses up you know you've got this defensive posture it's really hard to have that kind of positive conversation when you come in with something in common I mean do you like oh I like talking to this person right so it it puts you you're in a in a different like\nPosture ... and to me I think that really speaks about curiosity and being open and um and fear is what closes and right so I think it's kind of the work of all of us has to try to keep opening try to keep opening try to keep opening every time we have\nAn experience that might cause us to react from a place of fear you know can we pause before we react and said well what would opening feel like in the

morning's Daniel tell executive director of pilgrims landing and and look Claire author of numerous books including the halo effect eight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number our email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org\nSo we're talking about coming to these conversations um\nWith something we have in common starting them a little different so you're you're trying to initiate a respectful conversation focused on shared values\nAnd then it's not reciprocated it can make one feel angry or resentful\nSo how do you make that a more positive interaction or move on from it\nAnd let other great question [laughter] I think what we just said is to try and find a common thing and another thing and this works in every aspect of life is to take a breath and I know that just sounds so glib but really we're so used to being especially now\nReactive which can turn into reactionary instead of reflective so there's nothing wrong with saying nothing I Know we've been so many people have been silenced at the thought of engaging with more silence feels like surrendered ... but it it it can be the wisest thing which is to just\nFall silent and be willing to listen to someone say whatever they are going to say and then a simple statement of\n'em I Can't agree with that but let's move on to something we can have a pleasant conversation about just again the more safe people feel because this is off the air based which I think it is the more places of of safety we can give people to talk\nOf the conversation can become a fainter mhm\n[noise] yeah [noise]\nI also think it's important to recognize that we're human and we have limits and we have\nVarying capacities for thoughtful reflective conversation we all and I were just talking on her way up here about the whole package mhm we all have\nStuff that we bring into each conversation and each relationship that we are in and so recognizing one our own limitations but also we may be encountering someone else who has their own set of limitations and maybe that conversation needs and yeah and that's okay\nCrusade to change minds and change hearts but um I think it's it's always an opportunity to reflect back to ourselves where's the learning for me in this so I can keep growing and and uh being the person that I Want it to be in this world even\nWith um all that is around me maybe not how I Would like it to the house and and I think he said it earlier judgment if you can poach his without judgment because we're we're bringing our buys isn't as you said in conversations in our heads so if we can kind of you know mind ourselves at those conversations may not be what's\nReally happening ... singer has this incredible phrase that I Love and his book the untethered soul and he said if we could hear the voice in our head as a person next to us\nJak bring out us all day long we would get this person I mean it's like having a lunatic room mate in your head and I think we can quiet the lunatic room mate to um\nThose those you know again reactive voices in our head um that are just so used to we don't even questioned them anymore like why don't I like some of the smoking a cigarette you know um [noise] yeah I talked to John who's giving us a call from the arm is good morning John\nVery good morning ladies first you have lots of strangers ah there is no scarcity in life there's real scarcer all sugar you know for\nTheir ears laughter is just simply not for ... and then fill a we can get together as a group of people it's just like what would Jesus do\nYou're going to be open to accepting people and accepting ideas or shouldn't be\nWell I'm a Republican or Democrat and it's like a let's get together with our ... to ... and ... that's not very obscure sugar yeah let's not be fearful because here fall is just the ... all\nRight John thank you for your call you're breaking up a little bit but um but even now the Republican none of them were all Americans really there's never any right well Americans you had you on just isn't any think John brought up a a great word which is scarcity and I think there's this kind of um [noise]\nThere's a spectrum of of where we can come from and one on one end is scarcity and the other end is total abundance and I think uh I was just having this conversation with my father recently [laughter] because\nAnd if you're slices bigger than my places smaller\nAnd I was sharing with him my perspective which is abundance and I think actually the pie is kind of X financial and the bigger ears places that actually enables other people to have a bigger slice of pie and it kind of just keeps growing and I think we see that in nature we see that in the universe we see that in our we're in our natural world\nAbundance over and over and over again and there's creation and destruction and that cycle of abundance but it's never that there isn't enough\nEight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number that's eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point\nAt Cape and islands dot org so often um we are trying to change the minds of someone else when we're speaking about what our point of view is on something um but it's important remember that we also have an obligation to open our minds to when you're sort of talking about this\nUm and that's really difficult for some people some people do you know what that is not listen maybe that's a that maybe they'll have something that's going to change my mind\nBut it seems um [noise] of late that's harder for people to do\nIt is because I think somewhere along the line we learn to be wrong has to be dead you know so we're so fears\nAh they've done many many studies and there's one particularly that stuck with me which is they asked people to a group to take 'em a personality test that tells how they believed about certain things and then they took one group and\nGave them actual I'm inundated evidence on\nWhy some of those beliefs were wrong and um it was very well thought out they were shown lots presentations and then they had them do a test again and instead of making those people change their minds they actually the\nWhere a

I'm finding in hearing from people every day that you don't have to come to Plymouth to walk this trail first of all you can make your own trail wherever you are ... but people are bringing the grace trail five questions and concepts into the business\nI'm near a human resources using it to develop teams churches are using it and making your own voice trails they're using it in your services\nOr the recovery community has embraced the grace chill concept in a huge way because it's really five simple questions that struck with gratitude and it ends with open possibility and how much better does that get it right\nSo you mentioned a great created this a trail implements the older drugs so how long is that walk that walk as one mile one month and I expected the first six months\nAnd I expected a cease and desist from town to miss it never came Plymouth has done nothing but embrace grace they have been wonderful\nUm [noise] and they you know I've been in a newspaper in numerous times there magazines and the whole town schools churches everyone\nUm thousands of people walking as I get a little crowded on that right well that's very interesting I don't spread it down time with the tourist bureau 'cause I don't want a big bus right but I Am looking for a sponsor who would like to build a grace trailed downtown Plymouth\nWhere we could walk around the town and ask those five beautiful questions and invite the world and you know twenty twenty this going to be a lot of people in Plymouth ... yeah the ... anniversary\nPlease take the time to let her sponsors know that you've noticed and appreciate their support [noise]\nYou're listening to W. ca I your local news and information source for the Cape the coast and the island where it Ninety point one W.

eight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number our email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org\nSo we're talking about coming to these conversations um\nWith something we have in common starting them a little different so you're you're trying to initiate a respectful conversation focused on shared values and then it's not reciprocated it can make one feel angry or resentful so how do you make that a more positive interaction or move on from it\nOr like a great question [laughter] I think what we just said is to try and find a common thing and another thing and this works in every aspect of life is to take a breath and I know that just sounds so glib but really we're so used to being especially now reactive\nWhich can turn into reactionary instead of reflective\nSo there's nothing wrong with saying nothing I Know we've been so many people have been silenced at the thought of engaging with more silence feels like surrendered ... but it's it can be the wisest thing which is to just fall silent and be willing to listen to someone\nSay whatever they are going to say and then a simple statement of 'em I Can't agree with that but let's move on to something we can have a pleasant conversation about just again the more safe people feel because if this is off the air based\nWhich I think it is the more places of of safety we can get people to talk\nOf the conversation can become a fainter mhm [noise] yeah [noise]\nAnd to recognize that we're human and we have limits and we have\nVarying capacities for thoughtful reflective conversation we all and and I were just talking on our way up here about the whole package mhm we all have stuff that we bring into each conversation and each relationship that we are in and so\nRecognizing one our own limitations but also we may be encountering someone else who has their own set of limitations and maybe the conversation needs and yeah and that's okay no you know we don't have to\nBe on a crusade to change minds and change hearts but um I think it's it's always an opportunity to reflect back to ourselves where's the learning for me in this so I can keep growing and and uh being the person that I Want it to be in this world even\nWith um all that is around me maybe not how I Would like it to the house and and I think he said it earlier judgment if you can approach is without judgment because we're we're bringing our buys isn't as you said in conversations in our heads so if we can kind of you know mind ourselves [laughter] if those conversations may not be what's really happening\nMichael Singer has this incredible phrase that I Love in his book the untethered Sal and he said if we could hear the voice in our head as a person next to us\n... all day long we would get this person and I I mean it's like having a lunatic roommate in your head and I think we can quiet that lunatic room mate to um\nThose those you know again reactive voices in our head um that are just so used to we

there's this kind of um [noise]\nThere's a spectrum of of where we can come from and one on one end is scarcity and the other end is total abundance and I think uh I was just having this conversation with my father recently [laughter] because he comes from a scarcity mentality there's not enough the pie is finite um you know and if you're slices bigger than my places smaller\nAnd I was sharing with him my perspective which is abundance and I think actually the pie is kind of ... financial and the bigger years places that actually enables other people to have a bigger slice of pie and it kind of just keeps growing and I think we see that in nature we see that in the universe we see that in our we're in our natural world\nAbundance over and over and over again and there's creation and destruction and that cycle of abundance but it's never that there isn't enough [noise] eight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number that's eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point at Cape\nAnd islands dot org so often we are trying to change the mind if someone else when we're speaking about what our point of view is on something um but it's important to remember that we also have an obligation to open our minds to when you're sort of talking about this\nUm and that's really difficult for some people some people do you know what that is not listen maybe that's not that maybe they'll have something that's going to change my mind\nBut it seems um [noise] of late that's harder for people to do\nIt is because I think somewhere along the line we learn to be wrong has to be dead you know so we are so fears\nAh they've done many many studies and there's one particularly that stuck with me which is they asked people to ah groups to take 'em a personality test that tells how they believed about certain things and then they took one group and gave them actual\nUm initiated evidence on why some of those beliefs were wrong and um it was very well thought out there were shown lots of presentations and then they had them do a test again and instead of making those people change their minds they actually the belief became fiercer and more ingrained\nBy chance of weather got stock and chat um and made it to province town but I'm thinking about you know ... Ron wrote the profit and born and how we have so many writers and painters and\nThe the religious groups that set up the summer revival then Frederick Douglass lighting the abolition of on fire and you talk it so what can we do with all of our spiritual resources and looking at twenty twenty four hundred years in two years as hindsight\nWhat what can be put in place\nYou know to further this conversation\n... Kelly who's written a lot of what I heard him speak one time and he said no it's great to understand but if you accept that person become a person who they are to be out there that aspect as well okay\nYeah Murray thinks thinks that you have a twenty would time there's time to plan [laughter] and it's\nYou know it's interesting our our name as an organization is pilgrims landing in um being in this neck of the woods of the country we often\nUm people assume that we mean that the original pilgrims that came over and the Mayflower but when we say pilgrims we mean us yeah we need each and every one of us that are humans on this world right now today that we are all ... all\nSeeking a our own authentic pass and how to walk that in the world and we're all pilgrims accompanying each other on that path and\nIt's by being on that path I think with all these things that we're we've been talking about um curiosity and openness and seeing each other as fellow pilgrims you know seeing that divine connection that we all share that we're all human\nI think we enrich each other's lives by by walking uh with that lens and so um\nAnd I I I like what Murray said I'm about when we accept the person they can become the person they were meant to be that really spoke to me um it moved me actually and the other thing is I had no idea coupon world that I'm ... and ...\nDid you know [laughter] so thanks for that Marie and we'd have more information about the October twenty to vent at on pilgrims landing at our website Cape and islands dot org and you're telling him look thanks so much for

violent incidents that have been sixteen years before he was born all to improve that comes with that I've carried my whole life story on the world [noise]\nTonight at eight on double you see a guy\n\nYou're listening to the point a poll by the American Psychological Association and the spring of this year found that forty percent of Americans are more anxious than they were at the same time the previous year\nWe know that anxiety and stress can lead to physical and emotional disorders and decrease our quality of life like many of us and Joe ... stress and anxiety was growing in her life\nHow she learned to cope and was so successful she gave it a name the grace trail and she is on a mission to share for approach with others welcome well thank you I'm thrilled to be here it's so um what is the ...\nWell the greatest trail started as a an actual trail\nThis an inspirational trail in Plymouth mass that I created when my son was in Afghanistan the two thousand twelve and I was having trouble coping and I read an article in the Appalachian um about the Appalachian mountain trail and in the article the question was asked\nWho walks the trail and the answer was it's a whole lot of vets walking off the air war mhm yeah and so I said we don't I go to walk off my war I Can't get to the Appalachian Trail and I can't get to the California Pacific trail [noise]\nSo I decided to make my own trail writing them is math and um I went up to the beach and I had been working with the concept of grace for about Fifteen Years in my life coaching practice and uh the acronym for grace is that she stands for gratitude\nAre as release a is except sees challenge and is embrace and the questions that flow from that were that the word of grace is even the life difficult what can you be grateful for\nThe next question is what do you need to release to move forward and your life are a U.S except which calling of acceptance in your life at the ...\nSee is how would I like to challenge myself to move forward in my life and he is what's your name braces possible in my precious life so ... ... talk about the stress and anxiety you know parenting what what was happening\n[noise] well um I had a son in combat in Afghanistan and I could actually see him on Facebook and Skype and uh the reality was just overwhelming and um I found that by asking those five questions every time I did\nI felt better and um I decided to put it out on a trail to share with other people and I just walk walk down to the beach\nPicked up a big granite stone I wrote gratitude what are you grateful for and plop down on a trail and Plymouth mass and I did that for each of the five words on a mile loop along the harbor a beautiful um ocean\nA side trail and um I found that it certainly helps with my anxiety trying to cope with ah my son in war and what's happened is thousands have discovered the trail and they've made their way to put limits and they walk the grace trail yeah\nSo did you did these the five questions ... come to you I mean how did you come up with these questions is a great\nQuestion that's another whole show [laughter] I was sitting in my kitchen in two thousand and my parents are just post both passed away and I had\nUm you know two teenagers who were you know creative and challenging and I was changing professions and I lost my balance in life to be honest with you I lost my breath and I was having a hard time functioning\nI stood in my kitchen and I said man I Need to step into a state of grace Mm I didn't even know what I meant by that\nBut I Know where I was was terrible and that's what I saw the five words in the word grace and later on that day I started asking the questions that I had said and I I'm invited my husband you to join me and said\nJust questions with me somehow they make me feel better and he said come on let's do grace together and we walked around the block\nA every night for an entire summer asking and answering those questions and that's when I knew I was on to something\nYeah yeah research shows that walking and talking is good exercise out of the brain so do you think people could get the same sense of wellbeing from simply asking themselves the questions was out doing the physical activity or does it absolutely yeah this is really spreading globally\nI'm ... I'm finding in hearing from people every day that you don't have to\nYou can make your own trail wherever you are ... but people are bringing the grace trails five questions and concepts into the business I'm near a human resources using it to develop teams churches are using it and making your own voice trails they using it in their services\nOr the recovery community has embraced the grace chill concept in huge way because it's really five simple questions that start with gratitude and it ends with open possibility and how much better to Second Life so you you mentioned agreed created is a trail implements heels again so how long is that walk\nThat walk as one mile one month and I expected the first six months that I did that 'cause I don't own land I expected a cease and desist from town to miss it never came Plymouth has done nothing but embrace grace they have been wonderful\nUm [noise] and they've you know I've been in a newspaper in numerous times the magazines and the whole town schools churches everyone um thousands of people walking as I get a little crowded on that's where I was very interesting I don't spread it down\nTime with the tourist bureau 'cause I don't want a big bus right but I Am looking for a sponsor who would like to build a grace trailed downtown Plymouth\nWhere we could walk around the town and ask those five beautiful questions and invite the world and it hasn't twenty twenty this going to be a lot of people in Plymouth ... yeah the four hundred anniversary", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Point", "city": "Brewster", "day": "10"}
