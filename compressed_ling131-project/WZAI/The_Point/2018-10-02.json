feeling\nWays you're so steep that you really have to lean into the wave and and so there's this weightless feeling and it's very\nMinimal movement it's not at all aggressive it's not forcing anything and [noise]\nIt becomes really delicate dance on this massive\nRight here at the speech there were surfers and swimmers out in the water and\nA shark came up and grabbed a seal amongst\nI'd be alive I wasn't at all nervous you know I've I've known their out here I've I've seen one before\nAre attacks at the same mistake as for seals\nWe we just try to use\nCommonsense and caution\nTempted sharks any way\nDefinitely key might distance of I saw when I when\nI probably think about every time I go out\nAnd you know I look around to see if I can see anything and I've definitely psych myself out if I fall into the water and I lose my board or something and\nWatching it closely 'cause I don't know what to expect that the question to me as well as impact tourism and I'm I'm guessing yes but I've never been in this situation before kicked cuts and never actually banned in this exact situation before so it's hard it's hard to imagine it's hard to guess\nAnd I won't gaff but I Will um\nComments that we've been getting from the general public not out of fear but out of solution offering and um\nAnd more of a media frenzy than a consumer concern so I Do think that there's a lot of lessons are learning at this point in time people aren't as afraid as we thought they might have been should be\nSo So Greg I'm this remember saying All right some of the sharks earning my water over here but they're in the water over there can you do that can you say where the sharks will be\nWell you know I Am I'm never going to stick my neck out so far as to be able to say that white shark would show up in any particular area\nUm because they move you know and and they're all over the state but one thing we've we've tried to do with our research the last several years is expand our acoustic receiver or re throughout all of Massachusetts waters and that gives us a relative sense of where the sharks spin the bulk of their time and and working with individual towns all the way from Cape and\nTo a to a New Bedford we we now know we have a sense of what areas are relatively devoid of sharks for most of the summer\nAnd and those areas which are the hot spots and as you can imagine the hot spots include the outer Cape as well as parts of the entire cave or from province town down to well fleet and then the abundance of sharks diminishes as you move\nWest and north up to the the north shore and then as we look at south of the the Cape we see that the the number of an acoustic protections of our tag sharks is really really low in Nantucket vineyard sounds in ... during the summer months and I believe that's driven by water temperature\nUm but as things begin to cool off in September October we see the sharks are starting to move into those areas but in very very low numbers\nSo beaches had been close to swimming when when sharks are cited but how in forcible is that we we saw that even after the fatality people were back in the water the next day\nLesley [noise] well I can speak to the national seashore when our lifeguards are on duty from the third Thursday in June to Labor Day we have the shark attack\nAn incident protocol so if a shark is observed within the lifeguard beach area up to five hundred yards out we will actually pull everybody out of the water for one hour\nAnd there's not much enforcement that has to be done people get out of the water and they turn and look into the water to see if they can see a shark so every time we see a shark we pull people out for an hour once a lifeguards are off duty\nDay uh then we change our signage to indicate lifeguards aren't on duty to be sharks smart and we list all of the stay close to shore waist deep sigh deep whatever your risk judgment is entering the water\nAnd at that point you can't keep people out of the water there is no one there to manage it but ultimately\nNobody is going to be able to mitigate all the risk if you choose to recreate in the ocean you can be safe and stay out of the water but if you choose to go and\nWe can educate we can use science we can put up signs we can put lifeguards there but if he's still choose to go into the water that's a risk that you as a person are willing to take\nMany yeah interestingly from my early research on Seventy seven percent of the people that go to the beach don't go in the water oh really and general wow\nAll right so this way steep Greg is that where you go beyond waist deep in water swimming [noise] well I think in certain parts of the K particularly the outer Cape um waist deep is a very good guidelines\nEight

superintendent of the Cape cod national seashore\nLeslie Reynolds cheap ranger at the Cape cod national seashore and Wendy north cross president of the Cape cod chamber of commerce\nEight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number if you have a comment or question for us that's eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org one of the the problems we saw with the two shark attacks that we had some is with\nCell phone reception is those areas where there you know it was difficult to call for help and so\nThat's an area I think we've been having some conversations on as to how to remedy that what what are we thinking Leslie do you have any ideas on that [noise]\nWell I Would love to see better cell phone connectivity out on the beaches and that's a great discussion that will be having as part of the shark work group and I know talking to Brian and he's going to have a discussion with town managers across the Cape and maybe some legislators will get into that conversation\nRight now the seashore we use cell phones satellite phones and the radios to communicate any emergencies on our beaches but it's challenging\nYeah and I know the open Cape corporation which is a private um public partnership with federal money to build up the new backbone on the Cape for broadband high speed broadband they've had some um concepts that they've thrown out there I think they have a willingness to work with the advocate community needs to\nKind of strength and that network and and do it in a way where they are not ugly cell phone towers and they just you create a more robust network out there [noise]\nGreg you've been studying the electric for a number of years now are you seeing um changes in the way they're moving along the coast or that might change their um you know\nFeeding habits or what do you what are you learning you mentioned that we've got these you know like we can see where they are throughout Massachusetts what this but what else are we learning\nWe're using a number of technologies that have been for several years to get a sense of their their local movements around the Cape as has indicated earlier and you know when they're when they're a handful of sharks and we started doing this in two thousand nine um they seem to ... ... for the most part the located off of the southern part\nThat was our hot spot but as numbers have increased and that that is something that is happening we're seeing that in our data set\nOr we catalog over three hundred individual white sharks in these waters and in the in the coming months will come up with a an estimate of the total population size and which I think everyone will be interested in but as as more sharks come to these areas they ... they tend to spread out the they tend to find their own space\nUm and there are located all along the outer Cape as well as inside Cape Cod bay and and really throughout the state\nAnd uh what I'm most concerned with is as you increase densities of these animals a competition can can develop between individuals' where food resources particularly seals that are piled very close to the beach\nUm are hot commodity that they're trying to go for it and they become somewhat competitive for these resources and that that can provide challenges you know there's some pretty dramatic video of you this summer where you are out and ... on this charge just jumped right out of the water which it it just seems crazy\nDid that that means is that unusual behavior I mean it it seemed like something were to the movies\nWell I'm happy to say it's unusual behavior if that happened to me every day I'd probably go cut lawns [laughter] because um [noise]\nYeah that that was really strange this breaching behavior we've only seen breaches probably three times in the last ten years and uh usually there there's some attempt to it to capture prey\nSo and this this case ah I think this shark was either spooked by the vessel or actively so on my image on the surface and was was going after it so it was a\nA high anxiety moment for me what about their intelligence um or they may be smarter than we think they are\nPreferences is it kind of a I don't know what that is in the water let me kind of just tested and taste it and see if I can eat it or is it like on a I'm I'm ... you know what what is are they smart enough to tell the difference I guess between sales and humans\n... in general yes or they can discern the differences I think the story we heard at the beginning of this program with the surfers watching sharks that kills feels right next to him demonstrates that\nUm there are times when the good confusing information is coming into the shark and\nI'm environmental conditions play a major role poor visibility in the water for example water depths those kinds of things a lot of surge\nUm battle creates issues for the shark and there may be times when the shark is not necessarily a hundred percent sure I think in the swimmer that was attacked in two thousand twelve that was more of what we call a test by no nobody wants to be tested and obviously but\nAh that individuals survived with relatively minor injuries but in these last two cases this is this is not my opinion was a clear case of the sharks striking thinking it was a a seal that it was a going after\n... and you're mentioning like in the beginning of the season\nKnow who haven't quite figured out where the safer places might be where the sharks are and and I would imagine same thing with the shark ship new sharks coming in that are kind of testing the territory so to speak but they learn is the season goes on is that right\nYeah absolutely I mean we have to keep in mind this is a massive open system shark showing up new sharks each year same sharks who are seasoned veterans know what's going on but newer sharks are trying to figure it out and the seals as well we have young seals ribs deals coming in from Canada\nUm it's a very open system in early in the seasons some of the more naive seals of fault find themselves\nPray a very quickly whereas by generally mid to late July they they stay very close to shore they move inside the harbors and and let's to protect themselves and then the sharks have to adapt as well by by moving and closer to shore\nDefinitely I I also want to talk about learning and\nThe shark work group since two thousand and twelve has been really reinforcing how to stay shark smart when you recreate in the water\nAnd anecdotal evidence my lifeguards tell me a throughout the years throughout the summer or they'd have to blow their whistles to call people closer to shore multiple times on one beaches summer since two thousand fourteen are lifeguards have to blow the whistle a few times\nAll summer long so\nWe have learned the public has learned I have learned our behavior at the beaches is changing we're staying much closer to shore Mm [noise]\nI think it's important for people to know\nThat being bitten by a shark is a hundred percent preventable mhm to think about that and I also think it's important to know that the culling of a short of a of a seal population especially I Believe would create a crater backlash to Cape Cod and our reputation\nAnd create more conflict and more problems\nThan what we're currently undergoing now\nAm nodding heads around me I mean I think that there are people like seals they're still trying to figure out sharks but they like seals and ... and I think that there's um we need to to use the best science and common sense and really our role is to keep people safe like\nEight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number our email address the point at Cape and islands dot org more after a

our conversation this morning eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org max is calling from ... very high max\nOh I'm so I Am an average year round surfer here on the word\nFamily scattered across the country are always like jaws jars blah blah blah and I always tell them I'm more concerned about car accident or ... someone on the beach than I Am worried about sharks and water\nStatistically got a greater probability mhm um\nAnd then my other is um when I was in university I wrote a paper on humans can mitigate connections with white sharks\nAnd I've found a paper where they compared the visual cortex olfactory bombs and white sharks are trying to quantify the hunt or with or with\nAge and it found that younger shirts have uh proportionately larger visual cortex whereas older sharks have a larger olfactory bombs so like Boulder shark hunt more with\nOur son whereas younger sharks hunting more with their eyes which brought me a little piece of mind are confused where you'll probably be a younger shark\nCrank you need you need this sounds like [laughter] yeah max I might hire you as an intern [laughter] um\nNo those are good points and and uh I think it's we talk about you know some people like to talk about intelligence and sharks but would Max's indicating is that much of the brain of the the shark is dedicated towards sensory perceptions and with various senses are outweighing others depending on the the the feeding behavior\nAt at ages and that sizes so younger sharks or or for the most part um consumers of fish and it's not until they get larger meaning somewhere in the nine to ten foot range that they adapt\nThey become a better hunters of of seals and ... and other ... heads as well as scavengers of Wales so\nYou know we got this this this shift that occurs over the life of the sharks and most of the sharks we see out there hunting seals are are larger you know they're not the younger animals and uh [noise] um they're well adapted to to finding seals in the first they do so largely through smelling might andme\nExpert up another point Wendy that you said before we even went on the air you're more likely the odds are you're more likely to get killed in a car accident ... text and drive yeah exactly right Steve is calling from Orleans Hi Steve\nMorning I I uh live on the west coast or swim daily in east data on the street beach I something Jody I'm back\nAnd I've had to get out of the water I Can't\nI Can't swim there anymore because there's a a a a eight foot great

attracted to me the swimming and they would uh and that would say about just read back on to me uh but now the fight off the something else going on yeah well they're one goes I mean there ...\nI wouldn't go in there I said why is that they're the great white shark right there is a very calm day\nI'm right on cue or the fame came up the doors that were just watched it go back and forth like trolling ... and a half to hit it with a greater lip leader and uh well that's it yeah\nWell see that's probably that's probably a smart smart decision to ah be be where we ... and this is we hear a lot of people say that what we're seeing trucks where we've not seen them before I mean\nYou know and I think for a while they're in the beginning when we first started seeing them a retelling hikers well you know the the ... and and now we're actually seeing sharks and the pay is as well right\nYeah Cape Cape Cod bay and and uh has is in particular gotten a lot of attention this past summer we

closely because they don't know what to expect that the question to me as well as impact tourism and I'm\nI'm guessing yes but I've never been in that situation before kicked pets never actually banned in this exact situation before so it's hard it's hard to imagine it's hard to guess\nAnd I won't gas but I Will um and we don't have to do it now but I Will share with you some of the comments that we've been getting from the general public not out of fear but out of solution offering and um\nAnd more of a media frenzy than a consumer concern so I Do think that there's a lot of lessons are learning at this point in time people aren't as afraid as we thought they might have been should be\nSo So Greg I'm this remember saying alright telling the sharks earning my water over here but they're in the water over there can you do that can you say where the sharks will be\nWell you know I Am I'm never going to stick my neck out so far has to be able to say that white shark and would show up in any particular area\nUm because they move you know and that and they're all over the state but one thing we've we've tried to do with our research the last several years is expand our crew stick receiver or re throughout all of Massachusetts waters and that gives us a relative sense of where the sharks spin the bulk of their time and and working with the individual towns all the way from Cape ban\nTwo uh two New Bedford we we now know we have a sense of what areas are relatively devoid of sharks for most of the summer\nAnd and those areas which of the hotspots and as you can imagine the hot spots includes the outer case as well as parts of the inner Cape from province town down to well fleet and then the abundance of sharks diminishes as you move\nWest and north up to the north shore and then as we look at south of the the Cape we see that the the number of an acoustic detection of our tax sharks is really really low in Nantucket vineyard sounds in ... during the summer months that I Believe that's driven by water temperature\nUm but as things begin to cool off in September October we see the sharks of start to move into those areas but ah in very very low numbers\nSo beaches had been close to swimming when when sharks are cited but how enforceable is that we we saw that even after the fatality people were back in the water the next day Lesley [noise] well\nSpeak to the national seashore when our lifeguards are on duty from the third Thursday in June too late\nJack an incident protocol so if a shark is observed within the lifeguard at beach area up to five hundred yards out we will actually pull everybody out of the water for one hour\nAnd there's not much enforcement that has to be done people get out of the water and they turn and look into the water to see if they can see a shark so every time we see a shark we pull people out for an hour\nOnce a lifeguards are off duty about five thirty or it's after Labor Day\nUh then we change our signage to indicate lifeguards aren't on duty to be sharks smart and we list all of the stay close to shore waist deep sigh deep whatever your risk judgment is entering the water and at that point\nYou can't keep people out of the water there is no one there to manage it uh but ultimately\nNobody is going to be able to mitigate all the risk if you choose to recreate in the ocean you can be safe and stay out of the water but if you choose to go and\nWe can educate we can use science we can put up signs we can put lifeguards there but if he's still choose to go into the water that's a risk that you as a person are willing to take\nMany yeah interestingly my early research on Seventy seven percent of the people that go to the beach don't go in the water oh really and general wow\nAll right so this waist deep Greg is that where you go beyond waist deep in water swimming [noise]\nWell I think in certain parts of the K particularly the outer Cape um waist deep is a very good

Greg ... biologist in shark expert at the Massachusetts department of Marine Fisheries Bryan calls from superintendent of the Cape cod national seashore\nLeslie Reynolds chief ranger at the Cape cod national seashore and windy north cross president of the Cape cod chamber of commerce eight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number if you have a comment or question for us that's eight six six nine nine nine for six to six or email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org\nOne of the the problems we saw with the two shark attacks that we had some is with cell phone reception there's there's areas where there you know it was difficult to call for help and so\nThat's an area I think we've been having some conversations on as to how to remedy that what what are we thinking let's leave you have any ideas on that\n[noise] well I Would love to see better cell phone connectivity out on the beaches and that's a great discussion that will be having as part of the shark were group and I know talking to Brian and he's going to have a discussion with town managers across the Cape and maybe some legislators will get into that conversation\nRight now the seashore we use cell phones satellite phones and radios to communicate in emergencies on our beaches but it's challenging\nYeah in the open Cape corporation which is a private um public partnership with federal money to build the new backbone on the Cape for broadband high speed broadband\nThey've had some um concepts that they've thrown out there I think they have a willingness to work with the outer kicked communities to kind of strength and that network and and do it in a way whether or not ugly cell phone towers and they're just you create a more robust network out there [noise]\nGreg you've been studying the electric for a number of years now are you seeing um changes in the way they're moving along the coast or that might change there\nLearning you mentioned that we've got these you know like we can see where they are throughout Massachusetts why this but what else are we learning\nWhat we're using a number of technologies that have been for several years to get a sense of their their local movements around the Cape as I indicated earlier and you know when they're when they're a handful of sharks and we started doing this in two thousand nine\nUm they seemed to ... ... for the most part the located off of the southern part of the outer Cape some ... island Chatham and that was our hot spot\nBut as numbers have increased and that that is something that is happening we're seeing that in our data set\nOr we catalogued over three hundred individual white sharks in these waters and and then in the coming months will come up with a an estimate of the total population size and which I think everyone will be interested in but as as more sharks come to these areas they ... they tend to spread out they tend to find their own space\nUm and there are located all along the outer Cape as well as inside Cape Cod bay and and really throughout the state\nAnd uh what I'm most concerned with is as you increase densities of these animals a competition can can develop between individuals where food resources particularly seals that are piled very close to the beach\nUm are hot commodity that they're trying to go for it and they become somewhat competitive for these resources and that that can provide challenges you know listen pretty dramatic video of you this summer where\nYou are out and ... on this charge just jumped right out of the water which it it just seems crazy did that that means is that unusual behavior I mean it it seemed like something way to the movies\nWell I'm happy to say it's unusual behavior or if that happened to me every day I'd probably go cut lawns [laughter] because um [noise] yeah that that was really strange this breaching behavior we've only seen breaches probably three times in the last ten years and uh usually there there's some attempt to it to capture prey\nSo and this this case I think the shark was either spooked by the vessel or actively saw my image on the surface and was it was going after it so it was a\nA high anxiety moment for me what about their intelligence um or they may be smarter than we think they are\nDo do they ... when they were attacking humans they're looking for sales that's what their their preferences is it kind of a I don't know what that is in the water let me kind of just tested and taste it and see if I can eat it or is it like on a I'm I'm ... you know what what is are they smart enough to tell the difference I guess between seals and humans\n... in general yes or they can discern the differences I think the story we heard at the beginning of this program with the you know surfers watching sharks that kills feels right next to him demonstrates that\nUm there are times when a confusing information is coming into the shark and I'm environmental conditions play a major role poor visibility in the water for example water depth those kinds of things a lot of surge um that'll creates issues for the shark and there may be times when the shark is ...\nI think in the swimmer that was attacked in two thousand twelve that was more of what we call a test by no nobody wants to be tested and obviously but ah that individual survived with relatively minor uh\nUh injuries but in these last two cases this is this is not my opinion was a clear case of the sharks striking thinking it was a a seal that it was a going after ...\nAnd you're mentioning like in the beginning of the season in June and July we have new seals coming in who haven't quite figured out where the safer places might be where the sharks are and I would imagine same thing with the shark ship new sharks coming in that are kind of testing the territory so to speak but they learn is the season goes on is that right\nYeah absolutely I mean we have to keep in mind this is a massive open system shark showing up new sharks each year same sharks who are seasoned veterans know what's going on but newer sharks are trying to figure it out and the seals as well we have young seals we have seals coming in from Canada\nUm it's a very open system in early in the seasons some of the more naive seals of fall fall find themselves pray a very quickly whereas by generally mid to late July they they stay very close to shore they move inside the harbors and and let's to protect themselves and then the sharks have to adapt as well by by moving in closer to shore\nDefinitely I I also want to talk about learning and\nThe shark work group since two thousand and twelve has been really reinforcing how to stay shark smart when you recreate in the water and anecdotal evidence my lifeguards tell me\nA throughout the years throughout the summer or they'd have to blow their whistles to call people closer to shore multiple times on one beaches summer since two thousand fourteen or lifeguards have to blow the whistle a few times all summer long so\nWe have learned the visiting public has learned I have learned our behavior at the beaches is changing we're staying much closer to shore\n[noise] I think it's important for people to know\nThat being bitten by a shark is a hundred percent preventable mhm to think about that and I also think it's important to know that the culling of a short of a of a seal population especially I Believe would create a crater backlash to Cape Cod in our reputation\nAnd create more conflict and more problems\nThan what we are currently undergoing now\nAm nodding heads around me I mean I think that there are people like seals they're still trying to figure out sharks but they like sales and I and I think that there is\nScience in common sense and really our role is to keep people safe eight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number our email address the point at Cape and islands dot org more after a break\nMy mid ...

I said why that is that they're the great white shark right there is a very calm day I'm right on cue the or the fame came up the doors of\nAverage just watched it go back and forth like trolling ... and a half to hit it with a greater lip leader in a row that's it yeah\nWell see that's probably that's probably a smart ... smart decision to ah be be where were you some ... and this is we hear a lot of people say that we're seeing sharks where we've not seen them before I mean\nYou know and I think for a while they're in the beginning when we first started seeing them a retelling hikers well you know the the ... you know some and and now we're actually seeing sharks and the base as well right\nYeah Cape Cape Cod bay and and uh has his particular gotten a lot of attention this past summer we get a lot of reports from charter captains in in private boat owners and swimmers that are telling us they're seeing more sharks in that area so we we've expanded we're expanding our research efforts into that area next year", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Point", "city": "Brewster", "day": "02"}
