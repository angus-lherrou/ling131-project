were\nUm a very well known 'em prominent family\nThe ... and I could never figure out why Thomas decided to take a debt can job because he could've used his family connections for pretty much anything\n[noise] um but what made it um\nWhat made the story beyond the remarkable um aspect of his his survival was the fact that he um his name was very well known and even in fact the captain\nThat of the ship that found him a was from New Bedford and and knew his family and uh just showed how are you know the strange um small world nature of of the maritime world in those days and\nSo was the biggest threat to their survival of the cold\n[noise] uh that was part of it but what I'm really happened and what again kind of um [noise]\nThe story very interesting and different for me are these people didn't um rally together in the sense they didn't find a some kind of common a\nCommon drive for survival they were at each other they argue they hoarded food even from the

[laughter] so what becomes of Thomas night after his ordeal a Thomas night probably not so surprisingly he did not go back to see he um I wouldn't have a right so\nHe um went back to fair haven he I'm married later in life he um but he was um\nYou know you had an of a kind of life on shore he was a he was a constable in fair haven he worked at a um grocery store he um\nHe would tell his story from time to time um the last being I'm a reporter from Boston came down to talk to him in um\nNineteen oh five I Believe of about a year before his death and he um he told the story again told it in detail but remarkably he didn't make a kind of um cottage industry of she didn't\nTaught in out in it yeah yeah so what were his style I mean to be the only survivor of something like that the witness to witness what he did did he ever talk about that aspect of it no remark he didn't but you you have\nTo imagine that um\nHe\nYou know he that he would have um like any survivor kind of felt this you know why me why me why me aspect and um but again he kept it very private um his and I think maybe because and I this is again my own speculation from the research is that\nUm his family had gone through um tragedies at sea for a generation there had been stories of survival stories of tragedy um stories of heroism in his family and I think that maybe he felt\nUm somehow his story was not that

of um a really um draconian um life on on a life boats as\nThey were out at sea there was one story about people picking a\nUm other survivors to roll over board because they didn't have enough provisions but here again they um it showed the um kind of cut throat aspect of of a survivor of soy rather than people banding together and try to come\nIn and you write about how crisis changes what is morally acceptable so expand on the idea of of crisis morality and how it manifested in those left on the lifeboat\nRight well as I as I mentioned earlier this um was something that was discussed quite a bit in the nineteenth century among\nA\nSailors but also emphasis and others and\nWhat um what kind of\nRaised its head in in this case but also others is um this idea of this kind of Hobbs Ian idea of of life where um things get down to the um the brutish a nature of people when they're in peril\nAnd um this was was brought up quite a bit um after nine was rescued and the idea that um and even he said it was it was um\nUh like being on a on a ship with um with lunatics ones they started to drink the water and and attack each other and I'm the kind of a living near of society that you know keeps everything glued together was just not\nFair and we're talking with Brian Murphy his book is addressed the true story of tragedy on the icy Atlantic with the ... and the one who lived

in New England winter [laughter]\nYou're listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations\nListening to the point we're talking with Brian Murphy about his new book adrift a true story of tragedy on the ice the Atlantic and the one who lived to tell about it\nSo you're writing of this ordeal is so vivid and detailed it really takes the reader right into the the lifeboat with the survivors so talk about your research for this book in the sources that you use you mentioned you had the ships law but ... what were the other resources that you were able to\nWelfare was um\nIt was because um of nice um family celebrity he um got a lot of coverage in the um ... at the time and in the style of the day it was the reporting was a bit different than than now where\nThey would just have the um the subject kind of go on almost in a I'm In a diary type fashion so there was a lot of\nOpen source material I'm available on this but I'm the one partner this is why I like doing historical non fiction too is a it was so fascinating to probe the um the addicts and the um ...\nThings around the um maritime world a New England of of of the nineteenth century and little bits beyond just his story but all the the the kind of atmosphere ex were easy to um to get once you once you could kind of put yourself in a in that world\nYou write about how a survival impacted the actions of those in another life both from the American ship William Brown to explain what happened in that instance and how the public responded\nRight this is something that we we brought up earlier um this was a ship 'em again that a similar situation it went down I'm\nFrom a um iceberg strike and a ... on a bigger lifeboat there were um thirty something people I don't remember the exact number [noise]\nAnd um they were making the decision that they had a certain amount of provisions and they had too many people for the provisions at hand\nAnd they decided I'm going to at least the crude decided that they would pick people to sacrifice and events and they and they toss them over\nA horrifying [laughter] exactly and um and they had this kind of odd I'm a ranking about who they would who they would pick a single men were the\nAh with the first to go and then um people who um didn't have their their spouse or children with them and this this kind of weird pecking order emerged um\nSo what happened was um the ship was the the survivors were picked up by a friendship brought back to France it wasn't that\nI'm big of a deal in France they you know they weren't French they didn't pay much attention to what happened even though they sort of knew what went on on board a\nA guy named a set Eldridge who was um quite well known he had once um kept in the yacht of Cornelius Vanderbilt on a ship around Europe so he was so this was um\nA a gained a lot of attention the sinking of the um specific and then to clippers ships as well so all told 'em more than eight hundred and thirty people lost their lives and about the span of eight weeks\nWow so how did the loss of these ships and live influence safety regulations for ships mhm [noise] um well at the time the American\nShips mostly because they were um heavily involved in in um bringing immigrants over they had an open halt design which I'm meant there were no water tight compartments I'm so a\nOne area would would flood the ship eventually and of course this was done because it was cheaper but it was also you know more convenient to just pack in as many people and steer a jazz you can\nAnd what happened with ah the sinking of the Rutledge in particular are people in Congress um other advocates for for maritime safety at the time\nWe're I'm using this example to try to put pressure on ... on Congress to force ship makers to put in water type compartments the Europeans were ahead of the American to that time they were doing it\nBut it ... you know it's like the forces of um industry against the forces of safety which is a timeless story in a way and um\nIt sort of took the Titanic disaster too I'm really get the Americans to a imposed the more more sick build more safety into the ship\nDesign and it's funny because as you were saying that I was thinking of the Titanic and look what happened there right I Am an unsinkable ship was very ... [laughter] so what becomes of Thomas night after his ordeal a\nThomas night probably not so surprisingly he did not go back to see he um [noise] I wouldn't have a right so he um went back to fair haven he I'm married later in life he um but he was um\nYou know you had an of a kind of life on shore he was he was a constable in fair haven he worked at a um grocery store\nHe um he would tell his story from time to time um the last being I'm a reporter from Boston came down to talk to him in um [noise]\nNineteen oh five I Believe of about a year before his death and she um ... told the story you can hold it in detail but remarkably he didn't make a kind of um cottage industry of ... he didn't\nTaught in I went out and and and it yeah yeah so what were his style I mean to be the only survivor of something like that the witness to witness what he did did he ever talk about that aspect of it\nNo remark well he didn't but you you have to imagine that um\nHe\nLike any survivor kind of felt this you know why me why me why me aspect\nAnd um but again he kept it very private um his and I think maybe because and I this is again my own speculation from the research is that\nUm his family had gone through um tragedies at sea for a generation there had been stories of survival stories of tragedy um stories of heroism in his family and I think that maybe he felt\nUm somehow his story was not that different than than others are not that worthy of telling\nAs you were going through all this research um what what were some of the surprises I mean why didn't the logbook is a good thing but with the surprises that that popped up as you were researching this book\nUm I Would think the I ... I think probably the at least from the the the research and um [noise]\nThe logbooks I mean that was a that was a key moment in in in all of this um but when I guess personally what I was I'm most surprised about is how um\nHow I guess the idea of maritime disastrous was so built in to society at the at the time and\nA okay if there was a something like this it was it was a covered in both very prominent story but a ship could go down with three hundred four hundred people I mentioned these two clippers ships they had many people on them\nAnd it was kind of shrug and um\nIt was um brought up I in the beginning of the book I I quote a Pittsburgh paper kind of crazy 'cause they're far from the sea but\nAnd they were I'm kind of commenting on this how society is so was so callous and so you ... tragedy that they um that it would pass without much mention and\nAh I often think about these the forgotten dead at sea there's there's yeah there's so many\nThe book is adrift a true story of tragedy on the icy Atlantic and the one who lived to tell about it by Murphy will be speaking about his book\nAt the Senate bill historical museum on October twenty first we'll have details about the book and his upcoming book talks at our website Cape and islands dot org I think so much for coming in as many fish coming up after break just go at the symphony\nBecause those are the point coming up tomorrow\nJoin us as we sit down with will cracker and Paul ... who are running for state representative and the second orange civil district will find out where they stand on the issues from how we are addressing the opioid crisis to how we address coastal erosion and sea level rise the point tomorrow at nine O W ca I [noise]\nSupport comes from you and for members of our founders circle who's generosity keeps W UCI strong and independent including Judy and Phil from a non and Karen and Gary Greg our thanks to you and to all of our members for the generous supportive your NPR station\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\nThe U.S sent a warship through waters claimed by China and the Chinese ship steered right into its path they might well with collided playing a sea going version of chicken is not just the U.
