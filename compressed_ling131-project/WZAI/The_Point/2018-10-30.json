really need to get back to basic values I'm really interested in standing on my\nThe eight in the industry to make sure that they do everything to protect us region\nAgain but he didn't say that we start with you this time\nUm the district spans as we're talking about both sides of the bridges born in Santa Barbara just come under the purview of the Army Corps of engineers but there's been a number of suggestions um I think that the idea of a third bridge is kind of out right now but they've also talked about the state possibly taking over management of the bridges what are your thoughts on on what we do about the bridge as well\nClearly the Army Corps of a a corps of engineers that they will participate and getting these bridges are ... are replaced because even if the Army Corps replaces a number of places the bridges and that's that's really what we're trying to push for a governor personally said too that he actually went down spoke to them\nAnd that they are that they are very much interested in considering for replacement on both bridges obviously a significant amount of money but beyond that you does obviously gonna be land takings and and the like and the state has said that they will take over those responsibilities if they build the the new bridges of course the reason that there is because of this canal that is you know is\nStrategically placed um for federal purposes and that's that's the challenge that we have but I'm\nI'm confident that something is going to happen in happen very soon those bridges are eighty five years old the vehicles that word that we were in place at the time to design um we're we're really nothing to what we're seeing today and so um\nSomething has to happen those bridges are unsafe they need to be replaced I'm convinced that the bigger administration is committed to doing it and I've had some we've had some good meetings senator Markey brought down the under secretary to Army Corps of engineers to to even look look at them to have that conversation\nAnd it was a very encouraging conversation about the possibility because they have to spend some serious money to just to repair them\nThe money to replace them isn't that much more that I I think it's a real possibility I think you have to have some question yet we can't\nLet the Army Corps of engineers and the federal government off the hook on this the state has to be proactive and I think are we're starting to see those uh\nUh efforts in terms of getting some kind of partnership going between the state and the federal government in order to be able to properly addressed the issue of the bridges and when they were built in the Nineteen thirties they were expected to last fifty years and and as we just heard there now eighty five years old\nOn the bridges are constantly needing attention they constantly need to be\nPainted and repaired and we have all these lanes shutdowns which affects all the traffic\nSo we need a really state of the art of replacement system going in to take care of our bridge a problem down there I'm ... and I think that the state being willing to work together\nWith the federal government and the Army Corps of engineers is what's going to be critical there so we have to win the legislature we have to be on top of this we can't wait to again until we have a serious problem down there or something\nWe have to move forward plans have been drafted I've seen those plans I've looked at them I'm a Humvee is leading the third bridge is totally off the it it would end up in the in in the joint base and then what do you have to do still have to ... traffic around\nSo we have to also address the impact on both sides of the highway of the at the end of the bridge in order to be able to absorb the coming traffic we have to look to the future and be mindful of\nHow deeply this is going to impact the entire region it's not just either side of the bridge or the bridges themselves we have to be mindful of how we're going to absorb the additional infrastructure we need to be able to continue to have safe and effective access\nLike we're talking about with the candidates running for state Senate and the

I've seen a change over the years that I've been in the legislature but it's it you know over the last ten years I became more and more with people came to me and say I know I have a child addicted I have this you know just it was scary but\nI Will say the commonwealth has taken this issue very seriously and over the past four years the Baker administration said that they were going to attack this issue head on and we haven't and since then um we you know change the laws\nWe have seen a reduction in opiate uh opiates prescribed since two thousand Thirteen reduced by fifty one percent that's significant that is helping but we still have a long way to go in regards to you\nThat that was talking about we have to let young people know how dangerous messing around with drugs is and how valuable your brain isn't it when you mess with drugs when you as you said you were re wiring your brain and your route rewiring it for forever and it's a huge challenge to overcome that\nAnd um and so uh that's the that is the next frontier that we've done now we are ... you know I think a model to the entire nation because if you look at the entire nation the opiate deaths and overdoses continue to rise one of the few states in the nation is Massachusetts I think we got ahead of this\nEarlier um we're taking it very seriously putting a ton of resources and we've increased our beds by twelve hundred beds for care\nBut again as as we've said long term long term a a long term care is necessary as well and that's why we have recovery\nCoaches that are actually making a huge difference that have all in the past and pay for privately now you're going to see a ... of the government stepping up and spending more money on those recovery coach is to help people beat the addiction\nOkay I'm going to say that we start with you the same thoughts on improving the local business economy [noise]\nUm it that's something that I you know when I first got into politics it was a small business owner I still on small business owner and a gas station and I really focused towards him to the big deal for us down here on Cape Cod and it's been a real passion of mine\nAre to talk about and expand what we do as a commonwealth to encourage tours of maybe it's been a huge economic engine\nUm just recently I I was able to in this last year's budget get eighty thousand dollars offer right down here in downtown I'm downtown found this\nAll of the decisions that are being made are going to have an impact way beyond our own borders and we need to make sure that we're addressing those\nI think we're talking with the candidates running for state Senate and the Plymouth and Barnes Noble district of Rudolph and Vinnie ... eight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number if you'd like to pose a question to the candidates eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org we'll talk more after a break [noise]\nDid you know double UCA I can be heard on three signals Ninety point one Ninety One point one as Ninety four point three broadcasting from multiple tower locations allows us to air your fever NPR and local content all the costs are listening area\nSo as you move across the keep the coast and the islands don't forget to switch signals and keep us coming in clear we're here for you wherever you are and remember if you miss something you can catch us on our website Cape and islands dot org\nSupport for W.

day with Joshua Johnson what follows the point coming up at ten o'clock here on WBAI local public radio for the Cape the coast and the island\nYou're listening to the point and we're talking with the candidates running for state Senate and the Plymouth ... district and he didn't see it on Deborah Rudolph eight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number our email address the point at Cape and islands dot org and I'd ever would actually start with you this time affordable housing of course a perennial issue\nUm what are your creative ideas to tackle this that we know as I said this many jobs there's no silver\nBullet so what are you thinking on the on the on the issue of affordable housing\nWent on to keep things we have to do about affordable housing is to remove the notion that it somehow\nUm some kind of stigma attached to affordable housing and then it's only for people who are lazy or who are totally a\nYou know abject poverty I'm increasingly we're helping people facing homelessness who have worked their entire lives to maintain their homes and now they're not they're being pushed out of them um we have the most uh rapidly aging demographic in the state is here in this district\nAnd so many of those people are facing losing their homes and becoming homeless\nOr it's one of the five top concerns that um that aging seniors are identify as key for them the other area of housing that is a huge problem is for young people were losing our young people especially coming off the Cape and going or elsewhere because they can't afford to live here\nWe need to deal with workforce housing and come up with some creative ideas the south shore chamber of commerce has come up with a proposal that's that identifies\nHousing in the creation of new housing is one that can be a critical driver for the economy so we have to be able to look to new ideas and to consult with people who know more about this in order to come up with\nHelp us um and another area of housing is this\nIdea of hearing a\nSeniors especially who are living alone being able to make sure they stay protected but can bring in maybe younger people\nWho want to get out of their parents' homes but don't know where to go and be able to pay some red which would help the senior and help our young people become more independent as they move up into their own lives I\nThink if anything if they don't the reality of this area is is is such a beautiful area and because it's so beautiful we have a lot of people who buy second homes here and so they are what they do when you do that is it's supply and demand you drive the prices up\nAnd so it becomes very difficult for people to survive in this area if they're not um wealthy and that's that's too bad because that's why I you see this huge push for\nFor a affordable housing um the key is we have to increase more housing\nOf the bigger ministry has been very focused on that I'll just give you a few examples just recently here and found with we were able to secure one point three million dollars for the gifted street a workforce a housing project that's ten units little pond just this last week we announced this\nA little pond was also a a forty unit or affordable housing unit project right here in in ... um that is addressing that that need in the town of born we just did forty units there right off the MacArthur boulevard\nUm that is you know been assisted by a housing in economic development and in sandwich at one point five million dollar infrastructure grants for ah for going the roadwork going into a this piece of property in sandwich to create another forty units\nWe have to assist in in this vein because it is becoming so difficult for the average person to be able to stay and you know live in this area\nI as as a dad who has young children I I see it my kids I Would love for them to be able to live and grow up and you know build a family in a place where they they grow up and it's becoming more and more difficult and we have been committed to addressing those issues\nI'm In and I've helped them in some ways to participate and letting the administration no the needs that we have in this area and not just the cities but out here on Cape Cod and I'm really proud of what the ... has done in addressing that issue here in Cape Cod\nYou I think he was hit with that with you this time waste water management on another one of those perennial issues and the longer we talk about it the possible solutions that the bigger the price tag your thoughts on on how we should proceed given that we are in different levels when you\nAgain ... big issue uh that's why this or this whole era being be legislation and we worked with um to try to find consensus about addressing the reality of the a ever changing uh Internet\nAnd how how people are are you getting homes but in doing that and making sure from that revenue stream we make sure that a certain percentage would go specifically towards\nWaste water and we were able to put to point seven five percent specifically on the it'd be it'd be legislation that would go towards waste water which goes a long way to addressing the toy plan that we have here on Cape Cod I'm that we know that we are are are ... wastewater infrastructure is\nAh so you know is so under served in this area we do not have enough\nAnd the only way we're going to be able to do that is significant amounts of money and so the the revenue from that will specifically go to address waste water I'm really proud of that um legislation\nIt is it passed the house passed the Senate um I was a co sponsor of that and now it is in um and now it's it went to the governor the governor sent back with\nSome minor amendments we're waiting on the house to ah to concur in if they they can correct that legislation will be in place and it I Believe will go a long way to addressing the wastewater infrastructure that we've waited so long for here on Cape Cod\nA and a nice to see it actually come to fruition we're hoping or by the end of the year that that will be resolved\nThank you Deborah ups in question yeah we really need to look to having more creative solutions as well so many of the homes and that were built down here and\nUh also in Plymouth especially right along the water they have really aging septic systems in some cases they're still there's they they still obsessed pools we really need to make sure that those get\nUm upgraded because it's contaminating our groundwater and clean water is the other huge issue the two things are ... are just totally and completely linked and we have got to make sure that as we're looking at one issue that we're making sure that we're paying attention to the impact on the other issue\nIn terms of moving forward we have to get innovative in terms of looking at what kind of linked systems can we put together there are a a win sandwich did its municipal vulnerability project the MVP\nThey were coming up with some creative solutions in terms of dealing with their particular issues around wastewater especially in some of the\nSections of the town where there are a lot of a summer houses put together and they're packed together tightly and that kind of wastewater a becoming\nI'm so we have some green solutions for that we certainly have the\nThe education and the science and technology a talent here in the state to really come up with those creative solutions and that's where we need to be looking so that we're taking care of the future and not trying to just do quick fixes I got the boot off we start with the this time do you support standardized testing as a requirement for graduation\nI\nI have real problems with the M. cast and the park um I'm I'm I've been a teacher I was a teacher for many years I've taught everything from infant daycare through graduate school level courses and I've I've worked in education a lot and\nI so many teachers are are just so hampered by having to teach to the test all the time I think we need some basic uh criteria\nBut I think that those criteria can be met in the classroom we need teachers who are really looking to the performance of our students and making sure that they have the basic skills they need to move forward\nIs not so I'm going to remember of family and friends say David Was quieter industry is worker fascinated by police I'll see so

start with you this time um the district spans as we're talking about both sides of the bridges born in second mortgages come under the purview of the Army Corps of engineers\nBut there's been a number of suggestions um I think that the idea of a third bridge is kind of out right now but they've also talked about the state possibly taking over management of the bridges what are your thoughts on on what we do about the ... well I I\nSay that it's a big administration has made it very clear to the Army Corps of a a corps of engineers that they will participate and getting these bridges are ... are replaced because even if the Army Corps replaces a number of places the bridges and bats\nA governor personally said too that he actually went down spoke to them and that they are that they are very much interested in considering for placement on both bridges obviously a significant amount of money but beyond that you there's obviously gonna be land takings and and the like and the state has said that they\nWill take over those responsibilities if they build the the new bridges of course the reason that there is because of this canal that is you know is\nStrategically placed um for federal purposes and that's that's the challenge that we have but I'm\nI'm confident that something is going to happen in happen very soon those bridges are eighty five years old the vehicles that word that we were in place at the time to design um we're we're really nothing to what we're seeing today and so um\nSomething has to happen those bridges are unsafe they need to be replaced I'm convinced that the bigger administration is committed to doing it and I've had some we've had some good meetings senator Markey brought down the under secretary do Army Corps\nOf engineers to to even look look at them to have that conversation and it was a very encouraging conversation about the possibility because they have to spend some serious money to just to repair them the money to replace them isn't that much more that I I think it's a real possibility\nThank you to boot up some question yet we can't\nLet the Army Corps of engineers and the federal government off the hook on this state has to be proactive and I think we're starting to see those ah\nAh efforts in terms of getting some kind of partnership going between the state and the federal government in order to be able to properly addressed the issue of the bridges 'em when they were built in the Nineteen thirties they were expected to last fifty years and and as we just heard there now eighty five years old\nI'm the bridges are constantly needing attention they constantly needs to be painted and repaired and we have all these lane shutdowns which affects all the traffic so we need a really state of the art of replacements system going in to take care of our bridge a problem down there I'm ... and\nI think that the the state being willing to work together with the federal government and the Army Corps of engineers is what's going to be critical there so we have to win the legislature we have to be on top of this we can't wait again until we have a serious problem down there or something happens that becomes critical\n... we have to move forward plans have been drafted I've seen those plans I've looked at them I'm a Humvee is leading the third bridge is totally off it it would end up in the in in the joint base and then what do you have to\nSo we have to also address the impact on both sides of the highway of the at the end of the bridge in order to be able to absorb the coming traffic we have to look to the future and be mindful of\nHow deeply this is going to impact the entire region it's not just either side of the bridge or the bridges themselves we have to be mindful of how we're going to absorb the additional infrastructure we need to be able to continue to have safe and effective access\nLike we're talking about with the candidates running for state Senate and the Plymouth ...

question to both candidates eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org\n... you're trying to go for a similar type of the opioid crisis now certainly a lot of people's attention focused on this issue um\nCan help and are we doing enough to educate young people about the dangers of addiction [noise]\nYou know we're moving in the right direction in that regard but we are certainly not doing enough\nWe have three areas that we really need to address in the opioid crisis starting with education um the attorney general is put together a really good education program to deal with a A R elementary and and mostly middle school\nWith a legislature needs to make sure that we keep that program funded and deal with whatever can help us expand that\nWe've had good health education in the past and that has been deteriorating and we need to make sure we come back to really educating our youth\nUh uh about the dangers but we also need to educate adults and people need to understand the seriousness of this as a brain disease so that we can get away from the stigma of the opioid or any other kind of addiction for that matter\nOn top of that we um we have some detox we don't have enough detox beds we've been expanding those and then we need to look to long term care we all know that it takes a good twelve to thirty six months before somebody's brain is really starting to recover and rebuild the circuitry it needs to be able to stay away from drugs\nUm and in that regard we need to make sure that our health insurance industry whatever that looks like it's going to cover the treatment that is needed in order to really sustain long term recovery I've seen the effects I've represented children and Karen protection cases parents who are dealing with these opioid epidemic\nDirectly and it's not pretty we've got to do more like you have anything to say the same question\nYou know this is basically the largest issue that we have to deal with a you know we ... I've seen a change over the years that I've been in the legislature but it's it you know the last ten years I became more and more with people came to me and say I know I have of child addicted I have this you know just it was scary\nBut I Will say the commonwealth has taken this issue very seriously and I was in the past four years the Baker administration said that they were going to attack this issue head on and we have an and since then um we you know change the laws\nWe have seen a reduction in opiate uh opiates prescribed since two thousand Thirteen reduced by fifty one percent that's significant that is helping but we still have a long way to go in regards to uh\nEducation for prevention that that that was talking about we have to let young people know how dangerous messing around with drugs as in how valuable your brain isn't it when you mess with drugs when you as you said you were rewiring your brain and your route rewiring it\nAnd she overcome that and um and so uh that's\nThe that is the next frontier that we've done now we are ... you know I think a model to the entire nation because if you look at the entire nation the opiate deaths and overdoses continue to rise one of the few states in the nation is Massachusetts I think we got ahead of this\nEarlier um we're taking it very seriously putting a ton of resources and we've increased our beds by twelve hundred beds for care\nBut again as as we said long term long term or a long term care is necessary as well and that's why we have recovery\nCoaches that are actually making a huge difference that have all in the past and pay for privately now you're going to see a ... of the government stepping up in spending more money on those recovery coach is to help people beat the addiction\n... to say that we start with you the same thoughts on improving the local business economy [noise] um it that's something that I you know when I first got into politics it was a small business owner I still want small business owner and a gas station and I\nReally focused tourism is a big deal for us down here on Cape Cod and it's been a real passion of mine are to talk about and expand what we do as a commonwealth to encourage tours and maybe it's been a huge economic engine\nUm just recently I was able to this and this last year's budget get eighty thousand dollars offer right down here in downtown I'm downtown found this to allow the small businesses to to uh tie into Cape net because as you you don't have a lot of opportunities down here as far as Internet access\nAll of the decisions that are being made are going to have an impact way beyond our own borders and we need to make sure that we're addressing those\nI think we're talking with the candidates running for state Senate and

would if we start with you this time affordable housing of course a perennial issue\nUm what are your creative ideas to tackle this that we know as I said this many jobs there's no silver bullet\nSo what are you thinking on the on the on the issue of affordable housing went on to keep things we have to do about affordable housing is to remove the notion that it somehow\nUm some kind of stigma attached to affordable housing and that it's only for people who are lazy or who are totally a\nYou know abject poverty I'm increasingly we're helping people facing homelessness who have worked their entire lives to maintain their homes and now they're not they're being pushed out of them um we have the most uh rapidly aging demographic in the state is here in this district\nAnd so many of those people are facing losing their homes and becoming homeless\nOr it's one of the five top concerns that um that aging seniors are identify as key for them the other area of housing that is a huge problem is for young people were losing our young people especially coming off the Cape and going\nOr elsewhere because they can't afford to live here\nWe need to deal with workforce housing and come up with some creative ideas the south shore chamber of commerce has come up with a proposal that's that identifies\nHousing in the creation of new housing is one that can be a critical driver for the economy\nSo we have to be able to look to new ideas and to consult with people who know more about this in order to come up with these kinds of ideas that are going to be able to help us um and another area of housing is this um idea of hearing\nA seniors especially who are living alone being able to make sure they stay protected but can bring in maybe younger people who want to\nBut don't know where to go and be able to pay some red which would help the senior and help our young people become more independent as they move up into their own\nLives I think if anything the state of the reality of this area is is is such a beautiful area and because it's so beautiful we have a lot of people who buy second homes here and so they are what they do when you do that is it's supply and demand you drive the prices up and so it becomes very difficult for people to survive in this area if they're\nNot a wealthy and that's that's too bad because\nThat's why I you see this huge push from\nFor affordable housing um the key is we have to increase more housing\nOf the bigger ministry has been very focused on that I'll just give you a few examples just recently here in found with we were able to secure one point three million dollars for the gifted street a workforce a housing project that's ten units little pond just just last week we announced this\nA little pond was also a forty unit a affordable housing unit project right here in in ... um that is addressing that that need in the town of born we just did forty units there right off from the guards the boulevard\nUm that is you know been assisted by a housing in economic development and in sandwich at one point five million dollar infrastructure grants for ah for going up the road work going into a this piece of property in sandwich to create another forty units we have\nTo assist in in this vein because it is becoming so difficult for the average person to be able to stay and you know live in this area I as as a dad who has young children I I see it\nMy kids I Would love for them to be able to live and grow up and you know build a family in a place where they they grow up and it's becoming more and more difficult and we have been committed to addressing those issues I'm In and\nI've helped them in some ways to participate and letting the administration no the needs that we have in this area and not just the cities but out here on Cape Cod and I'm really proud of what the bigger Mr ... has done in addressing that issue here on Cape Cod I think it I think he was he at least that with you there's some\nWaste water management on another one of those perennial issues and the longer we talk about it the possible solutions that the bigger the price tag\nYour thoughts on on how we should proceed given that we are in different levels when you look across the district ...\nAgain ... big issue uh that's why this or this whole air being be legislation than we worked with um to try to find consensus about addressing the reality of the a ever changing uh Internet and how how people are used\nDream we make sure that a certain percentage would go specifically towards waste water and we were able to put to point seven five percent specifically on the it'd be it'd be legislation that would go towards wastewater which goes a long way to addressing the toy planet we have here on Cape Cod I'm that we know that we are are are ... wastewater infrastructure is\nAh so you know it's so under served in this area and we do not have\nEnough and the only way we're going to be able to do that is significant amounts of money and so the the revenue from that will specifically go to address wastewater I'm really proud of that um legislation it is it it passed the house to pass\nThe Senate um I was a co sponsor of that and now it is in um and now it's it went to the governor the governor sent back with\nSome minor amendments waiting on the house to ah to concur in if they they can correct that legislation will be in place and it I Believe will go a long way to addressing the wastewater infrastructure that we've waited so long for here on Cape Cod a and a nice to see it actually come to fruition we're hoping uh by the end of the year that that will be resolved\nThank you Deborah ups and question yeah we really need to look to having more creative solutions as well so many of the homes and that were built down here and\nUh also in Plymouth especially right along the water they have really aging septic systems in some cases they're still there's they they still obsessed pulls\nWe really need to make sure that those get um upgraded because it's contaminating our groundwater and clean water is the other huge issue the two things are ... are just totally and completely linked and we have got to make sure that as we're looking at one issue that we're making sure that we're paying attention to the impact on the other issue\nIn terms of moving forward we have to get innovative in terms of looking at what kind of linked systems can we put together there are a a win sandwich did its municipal vulnerability project the MVP\nThey were coming up with some creative solutions in terms of dealing with their particular issues around wastewater especially in some of the\nSections of the town where there are a lot of a summer houses put together and they are packed together tightly and that kind of wastewater a\nBecoming problematic in those areas um so we have some green solutions for that we certainly have the\nThe education and the science and technology a talent here in the state to really come up with those creative solutions and that's where we need to be looking so that we're taking care of the ...\nW UCI sustaining members helped make
