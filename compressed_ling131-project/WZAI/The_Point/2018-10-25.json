Todd later in the hour we hear the story of Jewish British a woman who helped her son reaches full potential and pioneered a new way of seeing people with disabilities but first the\nMajor battle of the American revolution it was the battle of the Chesapeake recognize today as one of the most important naval engagements and history that made that victory possible offend you feel Burke is here to talk about his latest book in the hurricanes either the genius of George Washington and a victory at Yorktown welcome good to see you again great to be\nI I Love George Washington I think a lot of people who've George Washington he was a genius lesson he\nHe was he was you know different from Hamilton and what was also a genius was a you know was a virtuoso a dj jittery genius you know someone who could immediately come up with the snappy phrase Washington's mind work more slowly but he had that ability to weed through all the static in life\nAnd figure out what really matters I Seventy and eighty George Washington had been battling for five years a very frustrating years and he realizes he needs to French yes because ah what he realized was it was the British navy that was really what was making it impossible for him to win this thing\nAnd he he needed to establish naval superiority for at least a brief time uh with someone else's navy and lo and behold the French joint on our side and they have a a navy that is not necessarily equal to Great Britain but getting there\nAnd Washington knows that if he can establish naval superiority through the French Navy this will give them the chance to deliver the blow that just might win this thing and\nSo the battle Yorktown was Seventeen eighty one but in Seventeen eighties you sort of start the book or there was three hurricanes Caribbean that took a toll not only on the island split the English French and Spanish\nMeanwhile you write another kind of storm grip the states of north and South Carolina Laura ... Wallace was in command of the British forces in that region so it kind of set up these two different stories yeah you know I called it in the hurricanes I because I think a hurricane is a good metaphor for that year\nThere were so many things going on you know sort of like weather patterns and uh with Washington in the center is at the guy\nAnd so you had in the south in the Caribbean what they called the west indies you had the navy at Washington needed\nBut in October I think anyone living on the Cape and islands knows it's hurricane season and we get hurricanes but they really get hurricanes in the Caribbean as they got three of the worst in\nThe history of recorded history uh one of them are killed or something like seven thousand people in Barbados it was so windy more than\nNot allowed to tell Washington the movements of the French fleet I mean can you believe this is this is the absolute key to this year\nAnd they're not sharing this information this is driving Washington insane I let's talk about the lord occur in while us and and ... and there are a couple of brutal die yeah um you know it's this is this is the the the revolution down south or in the Carolinas\nLee a brutal civil war a orchestrated in many ways by corn Wallace and his bloody cavalry officer minister Charlton who relished a butchery a and mayhem and and uh you know just terrorizing or the south\nThis was turning a a neighbor against neighbor it was just a horrible situation that you know and it's interesting because this is that the late in the war you know we've been fighting for five close to six years\nEveryone's exhausted if Britain just hangs in there the chances are that go to the peace treaty that will be in their favor but Charles but Charlton and particularly Cornwall as are in a kind of ... he goes into he could have been defensive\nBut instead he he turns aggressive and a Washington has sent that Daniel Green south\nTo try to rescue American fortunes and corn Wallace decides he's going to go after Nathaniel ... he and he has a much smaller army uh\nBut they are professionals are Green's is a ragtag band in green desperately needs militiamen to pump up the sides of his army that give him a chance\nAnd corn Wallace goes into pursuit across the diagonal across the breadth of North Carolina it's called the race to the Dan Dan was the river\nThat was the border between North Carolina and Virginia if green could get across that he would be in friendly territory and he could rebuild his army\nCorps last decide if I get green before that it's over in his do they have this incredible race\nAnd green makes it he gets and cry I mean if you you know it's it's within our yeah it's very close very close it's one of the most tense or a every day and they're kind of British are getting closer and closer green makes it\nAnd then a for a couple of months he rebuilds his army and then they have what is the most one of the most cataclysmic confrontations of the war the battle of guilt for Gore courthouse a\nNear Winston Salem and ah this it's a it's a slug fest in the woods and uh the Americans have many more men but they you know there are militiamen they're not they're not trained litter trained to have\nA a corn Wallace has a cracker Jack group about two thousand soldiers and they go in there and it is bloody mayhem and they basically fight it to a draw the British\nA field but a ... a green has succeeded in in ... giving them a blow from which Cornwall says army will never recover or he he loses basically half his best people and um it's ... and this is as important as anything when it comes to the ultimate victory that has a head\nI I Love the recruitment efforts at a section in the book where Cornwell says uh trying to recruit folks and you write the American dragons under leave or green jackets there were almost identical to the ones Charleston's regiment and they rode through the largely royal is countryside they were hailed by the inhabit if that's British saviors\nA just a deception Lee was happy to encourage that allowed him to approach Charleston's camp on molested yeah it's a civil war and so they're dressed you know here you have to calvary officers dressed almost identically\nAnd so the Americans are are you all through a little subterfuge are making their way and and this leads to a horrible massacre when uh\nSome uh uh loyalists tried to join you leave [laughter] and all these men go uh hang yeah yeah and and yeah once again this is it's really bloody in the south yeah we should mentioned the battles Chesapeake that didn't involve a single American ship as you mentioned at the French Navy and\nThat really sort of set up a the the the ability to have the way to yeah I I you know I think the narrative most of us have learned is a you know we had the great victory at Yorktown and we did it what we what has been sort of pushed to the side is the naval battle that made that victory virtually a fate accompli\nA Cornwall is by this time had a wandered out of North Carolina made his way to Virginia tried to go on the aggressive mode there and that kinda sputtered out\nAnd he had was instructed to to create to dig in a ... at Yorktown you have to sort of the end of a lonely point between the James in York rivers and a\nWashington has just been trying to get the French Navy up their established naval superior already so they can get them and we wouldn't you know an September first\nA admiral ... is a with a huge fleet of twenty eight ships the line\nSales up from the west indies pulls into uh the Chesapeake has Cornwall is around this is looking really good particularly because Washington and Rush Limbaugh with their army or on their way down I'm uh from the south from the north\nAnd then on September ... a\nBritish naval force arise from New York with the intention of rescuing corn Wallace and on September ... outside the entrance to the Chesapeake those two fleets go at it I'm not a single American ship involved\nAnd I uh and for the uh it's an exaggeration but basically for the first of the last time the French are triumphant or the British fleet is forced to return to New York for repairs just as Washington I'm Rochelle combo arrive\nAnd the trap is an off it goes and\nSo yes Yorktown is then the great seeds that leads to the victory that one of the war but it was a naval battle which none of us who hated\nThe key thing we're talking about how brutal the British could be and despite that the real anger and outrage was directed at Benedict Arnold even from some of the British absolutely I mean this is he is the lightning rod of the revolution okay yeah you think\nUh be turning trader would be bad enough well then he becomes a brigadier general in the British navy\nUh and uh he is sent down to Virginia in December of Seventeen eighty and he quickly proof he's not only a he's probably the best general on the British site now he he uh sailed marches up uh the James River attacks Richmond\nWhich is now the the the war capital of of the state\nHas Thomas Jefferson that the governor basically running for his life\nHas Richmond in flames and you know he's if he's doing it all over again and this angers Washington Washington says Lafayette after him\nThis creates the movement of troops that will ultimately result in Yorktown\nAnd you know and so you know people are so incensed that they come out of the woodwork to attack him and so eventually Cornwall is arrives Arnold Arnold uh returns to to a New York\nBut then in September early September he leads an attack on New London which is a nest of private tears and they're um he Burns' New London\nAnd then there is a butchery is committed in the ah Fort Griswold on no way across the river where I'm a dozens of American militiamen are are are killed after attempting to surrender and this\nCompletely uh you know if people hated Benedict Arnold [laughter] this took it to an absolutely new level\nAnd then when it comes to the siege of Yorktown ...\n... they're saying remember New London member of the wounded it's Benedict Arnold he's there at every turn you know\nIt's a fascinating um look at at the about the leading up to Yorktown in and what happens when you touch a little bit on what happens after we're not going to give that away though and you have at the the the epilogue you talk about each of the characters in the book and what went on what happened with them\nAnd the book is in the hurricanes either genius of George Washington and the victory

that it's over and so they have this incredible race\nAnd green makes it he gets and cry I mean if you you know it's it's within our yeah it's very close very close it's one of the most tense or a every day and they're kind of British are getting closer and closer green makes it\nAnd then a for a couple of months he rebuilds his army and then they have what is the most one of the most ...\nBattle of guilt for Gore courthouse um near Winston Salem and ah this it's a it's a slug fest in the woods and uh the Americans have many more men but they you know there are militiamen they're not they're not trained trained to have\nA a corn Wallace has a cracker Jack group about two thousand soldiers and they go in there and it is bloody mayhem\nAnd they basically fight it to a draw the British or can say they are victorious because they have the field\nBut a ... a green has succeeded in in ... giving them a blow from which Cornwall says army will never recover\nUh he he loses basically half his best people and um it's and this is as important as anything when it comes to the ultimate victory that has had I I Love the recruitment efforts at a section in the book where ... is trying to recruit\nFolks and you're right the American dragons under leave or green jackets that were almost identical to the ones Charleston's regiment and they rode through the largely royal is countryside they were held by the inhabit if that's British saviors\nA just a deception Lee was happy to encourage if it allowed him to approach Charleston's camp on molested yeah it's a civil war and so they're dressed you know here you have to calvary officers dressed almost identically\nAnd so the Americans are are you know through a little subterfuge are making their way and and this leads to a horrible massacre when uh\nSome uh a loyal is try to join Lee and Lee's man go uh hang yeah yeah and and yeah once again this is it's really bloody in the south yeah\nWe should mentioned the battles Chesapeake that didn't involve a single American ship as you mentioned it to the French Navy and that really sort of set up\nA the the ... the ability to have the way to yeah I I you know I think the narrative most of us have learned is a you know we had the great victory at Yorktown and we did it what we what has been sort of pushed to the side is the naval battle that made that victory virtually a fate accompli\nA Cornwall is by this time had a wandered out of North Carolina made his way to Virginia tried to go on the aggressive mode there and that kinda sputtered out\nAnd he had was instructed to to create to dig in a ... at Yorktown at the sort of the end of a lonely point between the James in New York rivers and a\nWashington has just been trying to get the French Navy up there ...\nAnd we wouldn't you know on September first\nA admiral the grass or with a huge fleet of twenty eight ships the line\nSales up from the west indies pulls into uh the Chesapeake has Cornwall is around this is looking really good particularly because Washington and Rochelle combo with their army or on their way down I'm uh from the south from the north\nAnd then on September ...\nA a almost equally large British naval force arise from New York with the intention of rescuing corn Wallace and on September ... outside the entrance to the Chesapeake those two fleets go at it I'm not a single American ship involved\nAnd I uh and for the ... it's an exaggeration but basically for the first and last time the French are triumphant yeah or the British fleet is forced to return to New York for repairs just as Washington and Roche ... arrive\nAnd the trapped is an off it goes and\nSo yes Yorktown is then the grape seeds that leads to the victory that one of the war but it was a naval battle which none of us who paid\nThe key thing we're talking about how brutal the British could be and despite that the real anger and outrage was directed at Benedict Arnold even from some of the British absolutely I mean this is he is the lightning rod of the revolution okay yeah you think uh be turning trader would be bad enough\nWell then he becomes a brigadier general in the British navy\nUh and uh he is sent down to Virginia in December of Seventeen eighty and he quickly proof he's not only a he's probably the best general on the British site now he he a sale marches up uh the James River attacks Richmond\nWhich is now the the the war capital of of the state\nHas Thomas Jefferson that the governor basically running for his life\nHas Richmond in flames and you know he's if he's doing it all over again and this anger as Washington Washington says Lafayette after him\nThis creates the movement of troops that will ultimately result in Yorktown\nAnd you know and so you know people are so incensed that they come out of the woodwork due to attack him and so eventually Cornwall is arrives Arnold Arnold uh returns to to a New York but then in September early September he leads\nThe nest of private tears and they're um he Burns' New London and then there is a butchery is committed in the Fort ... on on no way across the river where I'm a dozens of American militiamen are are are killed after attempting to surrender and this\nCompletely uh you know if people hated Benedict Arnold this took it to an absolutely new level and then when it comes to the siege of Yorktown what are they saying to inspire the soldiers they're saying remember\nNew London member they're limited it's Benedict Arnold he's there at every turn now it's a fascinating um look at at the ... the leading up to Yorktown and and what happens when you touch a little bit on what happens after we're not gonna give that away though and you have at the the the epilogue you talk about each of the characters in the book and what went on what happened with them\nAnd the book is in the hurricanes either genius of George Washington and the victory at Yorktown I Will have a link to more information about the

always did was to she can suss out anything you know so she could be in a social environment and she would immediately understand who who\nIs the the the the point person I'm and would um\nYou know making the line and\nThrough that through that ability she was able to make suggestions about how communities could in fact uh inter laced so she would um approach people and say don't you think that we ought to provide this service\nOr don't you think we ought to to um get together and try this and we open up the the community in some way well when the when Alan and joy\nUm and that it you build a pool in the background isn't that correct and uh and open the pool to the neighborhood um and Joyce being Joyce [laughter] it was a there was a flag\nOut on the on the mailbox and if the the flag was in one one way or the other indicated whether or not everyone was welcome to comedy awful or if the family needed their privacy for\nA while but mostly it was wide open and and there were reasons for that one was to be inclusive for everyone in the neighborhood but the other one was to get people used to being with science at play and enjoying the gifts that he had to give and that was mostly\nBehind the the the idea of of becoming an advocate for everyone with disability she became an advocate\nFor all of us because those of us without visible disability or things that can be seen at ten pages um the the we all learned\nIn different ways about the kinds of things that that are not so perhaps frightening or off putting but also about the fact that that people have disabilities are far more than the disability and then they have much to give\nAbsolutely have separate dissipated in the Special Olympics and his sister Jackie along with choice where volunteers with the program to talk about science experiences the Special Olympics in how these activities where events for the entire family\n[noise] this was the Connecticut Special Olympics or we started at the age or I think of about eight or nine and uh we all went along and of course I was it was it was new for us and\nI'm Sorry I'm really I'm\nWant to do it's a bit of George always had a way of convincing am usually with well you could have ice cream bribery frozen yoga works to this day remarkably well even now and even last week\nA cause I can be very very stubborn natural tray of\nIt seems of a of a people with Down syndrome so we did as a family and I'm I'm One of the things that uh\nWe did was in those days it was possible a spiritual them pictures or look there's organizer was now we participated in help things along that helped a bench move along and so forth and we would actually sometimes run along with the kids and one of the ways that would happen when he was a one would stand or the one that was a fire and the gun would go\nBe someone else or the other and yelling this race I come on come on come on and so you have someone running down the track with him someone yelling at the other side of the ... round and big smiles and of course\nIce cream right now in her work at the Special Olympics and other programs Joyce encouraged other families with disabled children to follow her lead in setting the bar high and being consistent with expectations how other families respond to her approach\nUm that was it was that was tough for many years because you know Joyce started the this organization which was in those days called clash in Connecticut which was um\nA a group of ah of parents who had a a Saturday afternoon or Saturday morning rec program and a\n... you know ... parents were just delighted to have the kids come along but they didn't necessarily want to get involved they had other things to do and Joyce\nDidn't have it wasn't going to have any of that she said people have to be involved and and the ah the parents became involved in that organization exists and thrives today with one of the volunteers who was a parent back in those days and it's working very well\nI just add traction Joyce didn't start the program clashed party existed\nShe helped along we're talking with Susan Klein an Alan British about their book Joyce's way finding normality despite disability we'll have more after a quick break\nI'm Steve Juncker I Hope you can join me for the point tomorrow morning when we discussed the local news stories of the week with some of our weakens

skeptical about applying for asylum in Mexico and there's some good reasons for that joined us on the world that's just ahead coming up at eight on double you see a guy\n\nYou're listening to the point we're talking with Susan Klein and Allen British about their book Joyce's way finding normality despite disability it's the story of a mother helping her son reaches potential and pioneering a new way of seeing people with disabilities\nJoyce was also committed to helping mainstream teachers and students understand different handicaps and disability\nThe book describes her running workshops that had students putting socks on their hands and then asking them to try and pick things up putting ear muffs are blindfold to simulate hearing loss or blindness\nShe also organized the able bodied community a tool to learn a lot as well so talk about that\nWell the uh because if she was an educator she was always a interested in being involved in in the schools and [noise]\nUm [noise] the there was a program that she became aware of and that she took a a a course with and it was it was run by the I think it was run out of the superintendent's office\nOr the administration in the area and uh she became I'm part of out of the trainers and um that involves going into classrooms and being with the children and\nMostly to to give them the opportunity of having an an experience of having some some one of their senses compromised and um and in that way\nWhat happened when they realized how frustrating it could be to try to to button with a sock on your hand or or to zip or snap or or buckle in any kind of way so\nIt would promote discussion and that's really what she was about was trying to find out a from students\nWhat their experience was and to ask them to problem solve so that they would actually be part of a part of a deeper understanding of what was going on rather than just being something that may have been seen as you know that some light entertainment to see how this was done she was always about having\nPeople ask questions and she would bring sigh and um later on to discuss what it was like for him and um which was brilliant and of course he did very well because his manners ... yeah\nOn the side I started at camp Chapman walking on the vineyard in Nineteen Seventy nine for listeners not familiar with camp ... tell us more about the camp and its campers

I think she was a teacher of I'm\nJust as she was actually a speech therapist speech therapist\nAbstract she she uh\nHad a wonderful in dominant will spirited she brought these she bought two or three of these kids over to the vineyard for vacation to give respite for the parents and then she uh she she built on this and she developed volunteers and then she started to get the community involved and ah\nOne thing led to another they they do they got some some land a nice piece of land in vineyard haven I'm and\nVolunteers started streaming in and before you knew it every year there was a a cap one in July one in August I'm for um people with handicaps and that was a symbiotic relationship between people who had um ... mental or\nImpairment and people have physical impairments and they would help each other and the campus developed into a phenomenal", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Point", "city": "Brewster", "day": "25"}
