I'm going to take care of six\nHad to buy the hardest thing I ... I think that the same question\nThank you very much great to be here so the congressman talks about being bipartisan he actually write three hundred and sixty fourth in Congress that's the bottom sixteen percent are the most part is a member of the Massachusetts delegation that is not very encouraging in our last debate cars when you belittled members of the other party\nUm nearly twenty times that certainly doesn't come across as being bipartisan I'm clearly that's one of the biggest issues we have in D.C today it is a hyper partisan environment and by the way it's not just one part of the other\nIt's both parties we need people to go to DC they're just stopped doing the bidding of their party and special interest groups and start working for you well I was president\nWhile I was president and CEO of ... jobs are routinely work with some of my largest competitors not to myself but for the betterment of the entire industry\nIf elected I Would do the same for you it's time we get party out of the way to stop putting Congress back to work for the people\nBut this is something that helps increase the pool make it more affordable more accessible\nAnd we should have competitive bidding in Medicare as well actually I didn't say to me what I said was it could be improved like anything else\nThey'll Keating we start with you this well they misquoted you in the market has been your time what is your position on the influence of big donors corporations and unions on our political system and are there\nIssue where you know the uh one of the worst decision Supreme Court made with the Citizens United decision and we're seeing the effects of that right now with these superPACs that are coming about the funding these super PACs are already in a few years ... Seventy five percent of congressional campaigns now\nAnd and then most vicious at that you see on TV in that regard up\nI supported the cuts for different bills to change the constitution\nSo that that actors reverse we don't have to do it to find out who's behind those ads this disclosure bill or that they're in Congress right now\nThe least will tell us who is sponsoring these ads we have a right to know what's the oil companies the cold companies and all these special interests so I've done that and I've also are joined with my colleague John Sarbanes in a whole proposal for lower cost a ... and a\nTax credits for lower contributions of which I Would say\nAre in this campaign I've had four thousand contributions over two thousand them for were under thirty five dollars\nI think Peter Tedeschi so I Believe in term limits and turn amongst us a couple of things the first of all get the folks that represent you focused on doing your work again as opposed to doing the bidding of the party the other thing it'll do is it'll get big money out of the equation congressman cheating\nIn this congressional cycle alone for over fifty two percent of the money you've received has been from PACs and special interest groups you know and that's just wrong over sixteen thousand dollars loans from big pharma ... me on the other hand just a little over one percent of my money has come from PACs folks\nWe need to get the influence of money out of your term limits is one of the ways to do that you need to get folks that are elected to represent you to start doing your work and stopped doing the bidding of their party and special interest groups special interest money is one of the things that ... our political environment\nOut to eat a piece of protesting we start with you this time I was going to an audience question do you support a single payer universal national health insurance insurance program for all of the usa\n[noise] um I I don't and and I don't for a couple of reasons um one is uh the government has not proven to be able to be judicious with the money that we give them today\nI certainly don't want to make them have they're making a lot of the decisions and investing money for my health care moving forward um when it comes to the Affordable CARE Act I think it's good because it provides a lot of a health care to folks that didn't have it before\nBut I think it can certainly be better um I Do like the fact that we have a I Do support 'em\nPre existing conditions um I think that's very important um but I I Would not feel comfortable moving forward with a single payer no kidding\nBelieve there should be universal healthcare a that's not going to happen right now a and one of the things that I Try to press on people is this what we want the future shouldn't stop us from doing the most that we can and the president and the Affordable CARE Act which uh\nThere's a new a rub revelation an epiphany that now you you don't think it's worse than health care but you said that in the vineyards uh\nThis is something that is critical and they're taking a\nHealthcare rights away right now not just those issues are dealing with the Affordable CARE Act but\nThe health cost of the tax bill\nTo point three trillion dollars has to be made up to pay for that tax bill that law actually went to corporate buybacks that's going to be done and the Republican leadership has said so uh it's going to be done by cutting Medicare Medicaid Social security even Mitch McConnell said it again this morning\nYou are listening to a debate between William Keating and Peter today asking the candidates running for U.S Congress and the ninth congressional district more after a quick break\nWhere you say there were you a farmer did you ownership did your own horses did you have cows did you have chickens [noise] did you have dolls you played with digital money make you ... ...\nDid you find in civil war how many years EU in there did you lose a limb\nDid you eat many cookies you know what a cookie is I imagine Ron crickets high rent backs centuries I Would\nThink men to Jenkins a paranormal investigator and west Barnes Noble on the best questions to ask the spirits and a graveyard when asked a question that they're going to be more prone to answer like don't ask him what did you think about the red Sox\nThey're not going to know [laughter] on the thing was wrong with this person [laughter]\nYou're listening to WC AI local public radio or cable coast and the island's\nSupport for example you ca I come from you and from YMCA Cape Cod where no one has turned away due to inability to pay last year for four hundred people received assistance in the form of gym memberships camper ships childcare and more YMCA Cape\nCod dot org and from the cooperative bank of Cape Cod prompt to support philanthropies partners of the Cape and islands and philanthropy day at the Hyannis resorted conference center October thirtieth the cooperative bank of cake\nYou're listening to the point today we bring you a debate sponsored by the sound that league of women voters and found that community television held the family at high school which I moderated you're listening to the candidates running for U.S Congress and the ninth congressional district where are you kidding and Peter to ...\nNo kidding you start with you and this is another audience question if you had to vote would you have voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court why or why not\nI didn't have a vote but before the revelations came about uh from Dr Ford or I Would not have supported him that\nUh you know the standard in the Senate for confirmations a used to be a very high want a ad no matter which party was if you weren't truthful to the Senate confirmation process you were dead on arrival this suddenly has changed\nYou know judge Kavanaugh said he wasn't aware or never had possession any kind of action at all with a stolen Senate document yet the emails showed that he did he said that he wasn't involved into controversial judicial\nConfirmation processes and emails show he did he wasn't forthright with the Senate and and that's standard alone long before the other issues surface\nI wouldn't ... Peter Tedeschi\nI Would like to leave going into this at all the centers and by the way it's an issue for the Senate not for Congress's Carson can you pointed out I Would love to believe that everyone both both parties went into this with an open mind\nAnd they would have allowed the findings from the FBI investigations leading up to confirmation and the post investigations to make the decision but based on what we saw transpire a few weeks ago is further evidence that we have a serious problem on Capitol Hill with partisan\nPartisanship people didn't vote based on I don't I don't know what they saw I don't know what they read but I'm telling you right now in my heart of hearts I honestly believe that\nNinety five Ninety six percent of the folks the Senate voted party line that is just wrong so I cannot give you an informed answer based on the fact I Do not have access to the FBI findings I think it would be a a ... really irresponsible for me to do so um but I Do believe what I think it's an important\nI support the me too movement I think it's very important I mean I Do believe something terrible happened to a doctor for\nA Peter didn't see we start with you another audience question in the current political climate what does it mean to be a Republican or Democrat ... what are the core values of the party\n[noise] for me I'll tell you right now just to I\nProbably what makes me a Republican more than anything else I'm I'm socially very moderate I'm very much in line with the sort of uh our governor Charlie Baker [noise] um and I think the problem we have today is both parties we're fringes of the party that are tearing the fiber of this country apart day by day\nWe need to find our way back to the middle because there are so many things that unite us we don't talk about those things anymore instead we choose to focus on the things that divide us and we need to be better than that and until we get back to that place we're not going to get to work at the people Don thank you bill Keating\nWell I I think that John Bellinger who was just recently I asked\nAbout the Republican Party in the status Republican Party said what Republican Party that's the former speaker of the house that was there just a few years ago we've seen such a shift in the Republican Party in that regard that the traditional Republican Party the party I worked with when I was in the state legislature\nOr the people I work with today across the island so many issues or they're they're but\nThey're almost captive to uh not allowing democracy to work you know and the doctor bill I Will tell you right now there'll be Seventy that's for childhood arrivals or to ... to be Seventy percent approval on the floor if it was allowed on the floor for a vote\nOn some of the gun safety matters there would be huge majority approval both sides of the aisle if it was placed on the floor immigration reform would work and we get something done and Social Security for him if we allowed it on the floor\nWe're not even allowing typical democracy to happen and part of that is I think the Republican Party or has been really hijacked by some of the er the interest on the national level I\nI think you've learned same question\nYes well [noise] one of my greatest achievements was when the my colleagues thought enough of me to like me speaker of the assembly for four terms eight years and during that time we raised the profile and the importance of Marshall County is simply delegates are with suicide member of that and then\nIn esteem remember they represent you each town has a representative to that body and by the way it is the assembly of delegates that approves the budget a bunch of county okay so you have we have a by camera oil um county government\nIt's important that each town has a say I continue to believe that some believe that it's too big but I Believe that every time she'd have to say and in the in the twelve years that I've served I have made it my goal to make sure that your representatives\nAre seated at the table when all the decisions are made bunch will county yeah\nYears I'm going to start this time I'm asked me how to run in this one I'm Sorry is this a new question yes did you into that started the first yeah\nTime really start with the with a run as a county commissioner what do you regard as a major environmental threat to the Cape act it's time to sort of touched on that\nWell I sort of touched on it already but I mean I'm a I was a commercial shellfish met have had a commercial shellfish license for over forty years and I spend my life in the ... of a chat him and it's been a good life and I recognized the importance it is to all of us and with that and I think that uh\nUh it's been touched on before\nBut is the ... the problem of global warming and the the erosion of our shoreline too so water issues are very important\nThere there are other challenges to I could touch on on the opioid crisis which is a on an unfortunate problem we have but\nI have to go back to the environment I have to go back to our water resources have to go back to the economy that depends on maintaining Cape Cod Cape touch attractiveness to the outside world and to the people we rely on for our income\n[noise] the same question I'm I'm going to answer that in two ways first of all those are the environment that is Ryan has a mansion in this things that we are doing we do have the two well wait planned each town is addressing waste water\nWe at the county had a situation at the fire training academy that I'm very proud to report to you that I worked very closely the town of ... putting forth first and foremost the safety of the drinking water before any discussion was had on who was going to be responsible but the pay for it\nAnd now we are still using that training academy we do have a clean up going on were working in conjunction with the violence will and keeping that water clean and that's the safety of the people that are drinking that water\nBut one issue that is not it is going\nReally not addressed\nAnd I hate to say it 'cause it's probably going to raise some eyebrows but it's going to be the seals\nThirty years ago we had two hundred seals on the K Twenty years later we had ten ... ten or Fifteen thousand today we have forty thousand\nIf it goes on checked in ten years we will have three hundred and fifty thousand seals on every beach across the Cape and he needs to be addressed\nNearly I start with you this time some people say that county government has outlived its usefulness what do you say to those people and I'm going to add thoughts that we've heard about a duty lately the stumbling making the county commission larger what are your thoughts on all of the camera\nThat's two questions um the restructuring kind of government I don't believe it's necessary I Believe that the way the ...\nRon pointed out we have the assembly Adelie gets which is basically town meeting its legislative body is made up of every representative of the town and we have three county commission is critical to five sure but that's not a major change so as far as changing that part of the government no I don't really think it's necessary\nDo we need county government down here and now we don't what we need is what we have\nRegional government we are not a county government as per the state statute\nOr the commonwealth of Massachusetts laws and regulations for county governments we are a regional government\nAnd yes I Do believe they regional government is necessary we should operate very closely under our shot up and we should provide services directly to the towns that's why we were established\nSo each and every town didn't have to go out and buy sand in Salt and negotiate a contract every year for sand in Salt they could buy it with all the other fifty in town just one example\nThank you Ron in question yes I'm very proud of county government and I think it works well the way it is actually a few if you listen to the assembly meetings you'll see that it we are now ... as a meeting of the Cape cod regional governments\nAnd we are regional government and if you if you're traveling and you ask people asked you where you're from you might say found that you could be for many state in the country you know but if you see I say I'm from Cape Cod and they recognize that we are defined geographic area and we have common interests\nWe have common concerns we have come and challenges such why we should go forward as a region as Leal says\nIt would be a lot more efficient and a lot more cost effective to deal with some of these issues from a regional basis and it is to have each individual town deal with it as far as to structure goes I've already said I'm a big fan of the assembly um as far as the commissioners go\nThe only issue I have this that we run regionally run from born to province town\nWe don't get a chance to meet everyone if we had five commissioners who ran regionally we'd have a better chance of going to the voters they would know who we are and given an idea of what their choices are so they go into five is an option\nFor them to actually start re this time what areas county government needs additional support after its time\n\n[laughter] we we've had several uh inter rations of things like the economic development council um the human rights commission the wastewater collaborative they seem to have been uh\nThat we have to stand behind the current the current organizations we have to let them know that we have confidence to what they do these people have volunteers they serve you they step forward and they they want to make a difference in our lives so I think that\nWhat has to be changed now is to reach out to the people who volunteer their services and worked for ... county and tell them that we had their back\nAnd that we respect their service and we appreciate what they're doing the same question\nOf the services that run mentions are a better run now under the new programs there there we've saved a lot of money by cutting costs and um we have debated with a different departments of where to put those services under\nAnd it was a process of restructure and I do honestly believe that the people of possible county has served much better with that as far as the single or area of of the county\nThat needs improvement or needs to maybe be expanded a I'm a big one for the fire training academy\nI have a daughter who is a right now going to college to become through state police program to become a police officer officer so I Believe I have a little personal kind of um background on that\nBut I also strongly believe that training and training our fire personnel R. E. M. t.s which we've now expanded the organization to do and hopefully or maybe even expanded a train first responders\nOr it is essential an absolute essential need of all the towns on the Cape and once again that's what the county should be providing things to the towers\nThank you and they're looking to move to closing statements now you'll have two minutes and ... year term tickled first\nI wrote this as an opening statement because I didn't know we are going to have a closing statement so a as a closing statement\nA first of all just as many of you in the room maybe don't know who I Am I Am married or have been married for thirty six years I have one child the daughter as I mentioned earlier she's going to a a become a police officer I Am a farmer and I am your current county commissioner\nOr I put my eye patch on because as I talked to many of you well know hall you also you didn't recognize me without my eye patch I Will let you know\nThat I cannot see out of my left eye uh being um accommodating fellow that I Am I Know that there are many people that would love to have punched me in the eye over the years so what I did is I hit myself from the side of the head with a crow bar and gave them that option I guess I did for my son\nI left I and the lighting in rooms like this really really bother me and that's why you will notice that when I read when I speak I have it on\nFor when I'm driving and walking around I don't necessarily need it again just a little personal background like if you don't mind them from like wow\nI didn't make some notes [noise] um\nI Want it really clear that I'm running on my record I've been your county commissioner for almost four years now a three years uh and whatever nine months and I'm very proud of everything that I\nBrought to the table as your county commissioner as the chair of the county commission is I Believe I've run the meetings fairly I have run them with respect not only to my fellow commissioners but certainly to the people would come to us in front of the county commission has also\nSo when you go to the ballot box I Want you to consider that and consider that I'm asking you to look at what I\nAllergy and asthma centers of Cape Cod Serbian Cape Cod and the islands and from our business sponsors whose commitment to double UCA eyes work on the Cape the coast in the islands is shown through their financial contributions please take the time to let our sponsors know that you've noticed\nAnd that you appreciate their ongoing support [noise]\nYou're listening to Ninety point one to see a A N double you see a I H the one\nWho told more than you're Ninety One point one W.

I've together not continue to do it\nOr we must however get folks to the floor I've seen common ground\nI Know there's more common ground there but when we have a leadership and the Republican side in the house right now that won't put bills like DACA or gun safety or some of the environmental built on the floor for a vote you never get to see that bipartisan work surface so I'm going to work uh\nAs I have been a on those important areas that we have coalitions on a I'm a cold hard on the chair of six\nHundred bipartisan ... the same question\nMuch great to be here so the congressman talked about being bipartisan\nYou actually write three hundred and sixty fourth in Congress that's the bottom sixteen percent are the most part is a member of the Massachusetts delegation that is not very encouraging in our last debate cars when you belittled\nMembers of the other party of nearly twenty times certainly doesn't come across as being bipartisan I'm clearly that's one of the biggest issues we have in D.C today it is a hyper partisan environment and by the way it's not just one part of the other\nIt's both parties we need people to go to DC\nAnd special interest groups and start working for you well I was president well as president and CEO of ... food jobs are routinely worked with some of my largest competitors not for myself for the betterment of the entire industry\nIf elected I Would do the same for you it's time we get party out of the way I stop putting Congress back to work for the people\nWorst I say I support it but this is something that helps increase the pool make it more affordable more accessible and we should have competitive bidding in Medicare as well\nActually I didn't say to me what I said was it can be improved like anything else\nBill Keating we start with you as well they misquoted you in the markets when your time what is your position on the influence of big donors corporations and unions on our political system in our their measures you would advocate to address this issue\nWhere you know the uh one of the worst decision the Supreme Court made with the Citizens United decision and we're seeing the effects of that right now with these super PACs that are coming about the funding these super PACs already in a few years five Seventy five percent of congressional campaigns now and and then most vicious at that you see on TV in that regard\nI supported the cuts for different bills to change the constitution\nSo that that actors reversed we don't have to do it to find out who's behind those ads this disclosure bill or that they're in Congress right now the least will tell us who is sponsoring these ads we have a right to know what's the oil companies the coal companies and all these special interest so I've\nAnd I've also are joined with my colleague John ... in a whole proposal for lower cost a ... and a tax credits for lower contributions which I'd say a in this campaign I've had four thousand contributions over two thousand them for were under thirty five dollars\nI think Peter Tedeschi so I Believe in term limits in terms does a couple of things the first of all get the folks that represent you focused on doing your work again as opposed to doing the bidding of the party the other thing it'll do is it'll get big money out of the equation congressman cheating\nIn this congressional cycle alone for over fifty two percent of the money you've received has been from PACs and special interest groups do 'em that's just wrong over sixteen thousand dollars alone for big farmer ... me on the other hand just a little over one percent of my money has come from PACs folks\nWe need to get the influence of money out of your term limits is one of the ways to do that you need to get folks that are elected to represent you to start doing your work and stopped doing the bidding of their party and special interest groups special interest money is one of the things that perhaps our political environment\nOut to eat I'm Peter Jesse we start with you this time I was going to an audience question do you support a single payer universal national health insurance insurance program for all of the usa\n[noise] um I I don't and and I don't for a couple of reasons um one is uh the government has not proven to be able to be judicious for the money to\nUm have they're making a lot of the decisions and investing money for my health care moving forward um when it comes to the Affordable CARE Act I think it's good because it provides a lot of health care to folks who didn't have it before but I think it can certainly be better um I Do like the fact that we have a do support 'em\nFor pre existing conditions um I think that's very important um but I I Would not feel comfortable more for the single payer\nNo kidding well I Believe that uh as I think most people believe there should be universal healthcare a that's not going to happen right now a and one of the things that I Try to press on people is this what we want the future shouldn't stop us from doing the most that we can and the president and the Affordable CARE Act which uh\nGlad there's a new a real revelation an epiphany that now you you don't think it's worse than health care but you said that in the vineyards uh\nThis is something that is critical and they're taking our healthcare rights away right now not just those issues are dealing with the Affordable CARE Act but the health cost of the tax bill\nTo point three trillion dollars has to be made up to pay for that tax bill that law actually went to corporate buybacks that's going to be done and the Republican leadership has said so uh it's going to be done by cutting Medicare Medicaid Social security even Mitch McConnell said it again this morning\nYou are listening to a debate between William Keating and Peter Tedeschi the candidates running for U.S Congress and the ninth congressional district more after a quick break\nThere's a big struggle going on in this small town right now in rural America disdain for the federal government can run high with the midterms approaching and NPR poll shows that many residents actually want government help but is there enough to go around\nBecause it's so competitive a line of communities a lot of places need help\nThat's on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News joined us\nFrom MORNING EDITION weekday mornings from six to nine here on W. ca I support comes from you and for members of our founders circle taking a leadership role in supporting double UCI including kitty Burke and Janice than ripe or our thanks to you and all our members for the general support of your local NPR station\nOh dear that's Ruth Stiller a vineyard haven\nThey were always the same pattern because she wouldn't use a pattern say odd puff fleas and tied in the back with buttons every dress or the same except for the fabric but when I got older I didn't like him so once a year or twice a year my mother and I went over to New Bedford and you'd buy your whole season's a clause\nYou're listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations you're listening to the point today we bring you a debate sponsored by the sound that league of women voters and found that community television held a film at high school which I moderated you're listening to the candidates running for U.S Congress and the ninth congressional district William Keating and Peter to ... I\nDon't see them you start with you and this is another audience question if you had a vote would you have voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme\nCourt why or why not I didn't have a boat but before the revelations came about uh from Dr Ford or I Would not have supported him that\nUh you know the standard in the Senate for confirmations a used to be a very high want a and no matter which party was if you weren't truthful to the Senate and that confirmation process you were dead on arrival this suddenly has changed\nYou know judge Kavanaugh said he wasn't aware or never had possession any kind of action at all with a stolen Senate document yet the emails showed that he did he said that he wasn't involved into controversial judicial confirmation process cities and emails show he did\nHe wasn't forthright with the Senate and and that's standard alone long before the other issues surface\nI wouldn't ... Peter Devinsky\nI Would like to leave going into this through all the centers and by the way it's an issue for the Senate not for Congress's Carson can you pointed out I Would love to believe that everyone both both parties went into this with an open mind\nAnd they would have allowed the findings from the FBI investigations leading up to confirmation and the post investigations to make the decision but based on what we saw transpire a few weeks ago is further evidence that we have a serious problem on Capitol Hill with partisan\nPartisanship people didn't vote based on I don't I don't know what they saw I don't know what they read but I'm telling you right now in my heart of hearts I honestly believe that\nNinety five Ninety six percent of the folks for Senate vote in party line that is just wrong so I cannot give you an informed answer based on the fact I Do not have access to the FBI findings I think it would be a a ... really irresponsible for me to do so\nI think it's important I support the me too movement I think it's very important I mean I Do believe something a terrible did happen to a doctor for\nA Peter did actually we start with you another audience questions in the current political climate what does it mean to be a Republican or Democrat ... what are the core values of the party\n[noise]\nFor me I'll tell you right now just to I Am a physically very conservative I think that's probably what makes me a Republican more than anything else um I Am socially very moderate I'm very much in line with the sort of uh\nOur governor Charlie Baker um and I think the problem we have today is both parties we're fringes of the party that are tearing the fiber of this country apart day by day we need to find our way back to the middle because there are so many things that unite us we don't talk about those things anymore instead we choose to focus on the things that divide us and we need to be better than\nAnd until we get back to that place we're not going to get to work at the people done thank you no kidding\nWell I I think that John painter who was just recently uh asked\nAbout the Republican Party and the status of the Republican Party said what Republican Party that's the former speaker of the house\nThat was there just a few years ago we've seen such a shift in the Republican Party in that regard that the traditional Republican Party the party I worked with when I was in the state legislature\nUh the people I work with today are across the island so many issues or they're they're but they're almost captive to or not allowing democracy to work you know in the dock of bill I Will tell you right now there would be Seventy that's for childhood arrivals or to\nTell me to be Seventy percent approval on the floor if it was allowed on the floor for a vote\nOn on some of the gun safety matters there would be huge majority approval both sides of the aisle if it was placed on the floor immigration reform would work and we get something done and Social Security for if we allowed it on the floor\nWe're not even allowing typical democracy to happen and part of that is I think the Republican Party or has been really hijacked by some of the er the interest on the national level I\nThink you were gonna move to closing comment now and they'll Keating you go first you have two minutes\nI think you learned same question yes well [noise]\nOne of my greatest achievements was when the my colleagues stone enough of me to like me speaker of the assembly for four terms eight years and during that time we raised the profile and the importance of Marshall County is simply delegates are with Susan member of that and then\nAnd his team member they represent you each town has a representative to that body and by the way it is the assembly of delegates that approves the budget a bunch of county okay so you have we have a by camera or a county government\nIt's important that each town has a say I continue to believe that some believe that\nA say in the in the twelve years that I served I have made it my goal to make sure that your representatives are seated at the table when all the decisions are made in ... county yeah\nYou don't use them I Believe we're going to do in this time I'm asking are you running this one I'm Sorry this is a new question yeah did you mean like when I started the first you have to go to you act so now this time really start with the with a run as a county commissioner what do you regard as the major environmental threat to the Cape aquifers time sort of touched on that\nWell I sort of touched on it already but I mean I'm a I was a commercial shellfish met have had a commercial shellfish license for\nOver forty years and I spend my life in the ... of the Chatham and it's been a good life and I recognized the importance it is to all of us and with that and I think that uh and it's been touched on before\nBut is the ... the problem of global warming and the the erosion of our shoreline too so water issues are very important there there are other challenges to I could touch on um the opioid crisis which is a an an unfortunate problem we have but\nI have to go back to the environment I have to go back to our water resources I have to go back to the economy that depends on maintaining Cape Cod Cape ... to the outside world and to the people we rely on for our income you know the same question\nI'm I'm going to answer that in two ways first of all those are the environment that as Ryan has a mansion in this things that we are doing we do have the two well wait planned each town is addressing waste water\nWe use the county had a situation at the fire training academy that I'm very proud to report to you that I work very closely the town of ... putting forth first and foremost the safety of the drinking water before any discussion was had on who was going to be responsible to pay for it\nAnd now we are still using that training academy we do have a clean up going on were working in conjunction with the town a bicycle and keeping that water clean and that's the safety of the people that are drinking that water but one issue that is not it is going\nReally not addressed\nAnd I hate to say it 'cause it's probably going to raise some eyebrows but it's got to be the seals\nThirty years ago we had two hundred seals on the cake Twenty years later we had ten ... ten or Fifteen thousand today we have forty thousand if it goes on checked in ten years we will have three hundred and fifty five\nAcross the Cape and he needs to be addressed\nNearly I start with you this time some people say that county government has outlived its usefulness what do you say to those people and I'm going to add thoughts that we've heard about a do they live with the assembly and then making the county commission larger what are your thoughts on the role of the\n... well that's two questions um the restructuring kind of government I don't believe it's necessary I Believe that the way that the government is structured is excellent as Ron pointed out we have the assembly Adelie gets which is basically town meeting its legislative body is made up of every representative of the town\nAnd we have three county commission is critical to five sure but that's not a major change so as far as changing that part of the government no I don't really think it's necessary do we need county government down you know we don't what we need is what we have regional government\nWe are not a county government as per the states that true\nOr the commonwealth of Massachusetts laws and regulations for county governments we are a regional government\nAnd yes I Do believe they regional government is necessary we should operate very closely under our shot up and we should provide services directly to the towns that's why we were established\nSo each and every town didn't have to go out and buy sand and salt and negotiate a contract every year for sand in Salt they could buy it with all the other fifty in town just one example\nYou Ron same question yes I'm very proud of county government and I think it works well the way it is actually if you if you listen to the assembly meetings you'll see that if we are now ... as a meeting of the Cape cod regional government\nAnd we are regional government and if you if you're traveling and you ask people asked you where you're from you might say found that you could be for many state in the country you know but if you see I say I'm from Cape Cod and they recognize that we are defined geographic area and we have common interests\nWe have common concerns we have come and challenges such why we should go forward this region as Leal says\nIt would be a lot more efficient and a lot more cost effective to deal with some of these issues from a regional basis and it is to have each individual town deal with it as far as to structure goes I've already said I'm a big fan of the assembly um as far as the commissioners go\nThe only issue I have is that we run regionally run from born to province town\nWe don't get a chance to meet everyone if we had five commissioners who ran regionally we'd have a better chance of going to the voters they would know who we are\nOur so they go into five is an option a ... and we start we this time what areas county government needs additional support at this time\n\nWell we we've had several uh inter rations of things like the economic development council um the human rights commission the wastewater collaborative they seemed to have been challenged and changed and I think that we have to stand behind the current\nThe current organizations we have to let them know that we have confidence to what they do these people have volunteers they serve you they step forward\nAnd they they want to make a difference in our lives until I think that\nWhat has to be changed now is to reach out to the people who volunteer their services and work for partial county and tell them that we had their back\nAnd that we respect their service and we appreciate what they're doing the same question\nOther services that run mentions are a better run now under the new programs there there were saved a lot of money by cutting costs and um we have debated with a different departments of where to put those services under\nAnd it was a process of restructure and I do honestly believe that the people have possible county us are much better with that as far as the single or area of of the county\nThat needs improvement our needs to maybe be expanded a I'm a big one for the fire training academy I have a daughter who is a right now going to college to become through state police program to become a police officer officer so I Believe I have a little personal kind of um background on that\nBut I also strongly believe that training and training our fire personnel R. E. M. t.s which we've now expanded the organization to do and hopefully or maybe even expanded a train a first responders\nOr it is essential an absolute essential need of all the towns on the Cape and once again that's what the company should be providing things to the tower\nThank you and they're looking to move to closing statements now you'll have two minutes and ... says you're trying to go\nFirst I wrote this as an opening statement because I didn't know we were going to have a closing statement so a as a closing statement\nA first of all just as many of you in the room maybe don't know who I Am I Am married or have been married for thirty six years I have one child the daughter as I mentioned earlier she's going to a of become a police officer I Am a farmer and I am your parents county commissioner\nMany of you well know hall you also you didn't recognize me without my eye patch I Will let you know\nThat I cannot see out of my left eye or being um accommodating fellow that I Am I Know that there are many people that would love to punch me in the eye over the years so what I did is I hit myself on the side of the head with a crow bar and gave them that option I guess I did for myself\nBut I lost the site in my left eye and the lighting in rooms like this really really bother me and that's why you will notice that when I read when I speak I have it on but when I'm driving and walking around I don't\nNecessarily need it again just a little personal background you don't mind them from like wow I didn't make some notes [noise] um\nI Want it really clear that I'm running on my record I've been your county commissioner for almost four years now of three years uh and whatever nine months and I'm very proud of everything that I\nBrought to the table as your county commissioner as the chair of the county commission is I Believe I've run the meetings\nFairly I have run them with respect not only to my fellow commissioners but certainly to the people would come to us in front of the county commission is also so when you go to the ballot box I Want you to consider that and consider that I'm asking you to look at what I have brought to the table and what I have done", "show_name": "The Point", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "24"}
