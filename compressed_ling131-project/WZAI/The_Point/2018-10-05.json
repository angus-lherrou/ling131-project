Cape and the island's let's start this week Patrick talking about very big project that raised a lot of local concern in interest this is the offshore wind project proposed by the company vineyard wind\nWants to bring it power transmission cable to shore somewhere along the Cape yesterday news was that the company has signed a host agreement with Barnes double yeah\nAnd this news really evolved this week uh you know we started this week looking at the fact that the hearings\nFor that uh cable we're gonna started yesterday and did started yesterday in uh Boston at the energy facilities citing board this is a nine member board that's responsible for looking at how energy is\nA a resources are in this state and and basically measuring energy projects based on a couple of different parameters environmental concerns cost\nUm and and one of the factor and so the the board was going to start taking up this transmission cable which is going to connect to the offshore wind project which is a hundred and six turbines that vineyard wind is planning south of the vineyard in federal waters\nDifferent from Cape Wind or in terms of the proximity to shore Cape Wind was going to be and they took it sound also federal waters but obviously garnered a lot more opposition um the place where the rubber meets the road here is where the transmission cable comes ashore\nAnd up until this week everybody was looking at the preferred route that vineyard wind had laid out as coming through Lewis Bay and on short in West Yarmuth er which was the same route that Cape Wind had had proposed itself\nAnd then in the last twenty four hours forty eight hours or so we started hearing some things that seemed to indicate that the alternative route that they had been looking at which is ... beach in Centerville\nComing through Nantucket Sound and landing there or was starting to to uh become the preferred route if you will and a vineyard win last night uh officially a made a press release that that said that they were looking at this and had signed a host community agreement with the town of Barnes Noble\nUm the town of Barnes will had raised concerns or from the get go about where this cable was going to go once it came on shore it was going to travel through or if it had gone on shore in West Yarmuth\nThrough Yarmuth to Barnes will to a substation bicycle and ...

the Cape cod times is Patrick Cassidy and on the phone with us now from the Cape cod chronicle is him would good morning Tim good morning Steve\nTim both Chatham in Orleans have raised the idea of the towns buying their own dredge as a piece of equipment that the town's could use when they want you to the great article looking at what the costs are actually involved in purchasing a dredging operating in and it's a lot more money than most people seem to have considered\nYeah it's pretty eye opening when you when you look at the figures I'm both a charming her which has had a need for dredging numerous times especially Chatham I'm as we've talked about um recently um there's just a lot of showing a lot of a fan of booze around and shot him and to keep the navigate\nA to keep the waterways navigational hum the county dredges here quite often and that's what most towns on the Cape ... pretty much all the towns on the Cape\nRely on for their dredging needs a which is the ... county dredge they actually own to ... which uh provide that service\nReally at a a much lower rate than what the town's would have to pay for commercial judges um [noise] but those judges are really busy I'm In between whether and and blackout period for for protecting certain species that can be a competitive to secure a spot on the county dredge schedule and that's why\nOne of the reasons Chatham at Orleans have both looked at the uh the efficacy of purchasing their own dredges 'em and you know it's like you said Steve that sounds good [noise] um to have a dredge on hand when it's\nIt doesn't make financial sense for an individual town to own a dredge um ... county administrator or checking you notice a told us that uh you know the annual operating expenses for the county top one point five million dollars\nAnd a while the county generally brings in enough revenue to cover that costs that doesn't always happen um because of a you know whether and and things like that\nUm when the ... just can't operate and so they they do have to have a\nReserve fund to to make up that a revenue [noise] um but ah an analysis done by chat um ... coastal resources department\nEstimated that just the cost of purchasing a dredge would be more than a three and a half million dollars and uh the dredge itself is is that about a million and a half\nBut there's a lot of equipment that needs to go along with it in order to make it operational such as ah pumps a heavy equipment to move or a pipes around and and those pipelines can be pretty expensive here in Chatham they often have to a\nPump sand or that stretched a you know thousands of feet and and that can run into a lot of money for those pipelines\n[noise] a coastal resources director ... can you basically he said you know we can't just buy a dredge we have to buy all this equipment that goes along with it but ah probably the more significant costs you know capital costs can be a ... over a number of years but\nUh the one of the most more significant costs a um we were told was that um to keep a crew on hand to run and dredge is going to cost a seven to eight hundred thousand dollars a year [noise] um there's it's it's usually a five member crew and those people have to be kept on staff all year round\nEven when the judges idle in winter or during other periods\nAnd there's also a annual maintenance costs according to a you know I just that uh are are are can be pretty significant um\nLast uh this past a few months the judges are both county judges were in ... and there were unable to operate because they were having maintenance problems and and that went on for weeks [noise] um now the county ... county administrator hum added that to you know the state has\nReally encourages towns to work together on regional levels and he doubts that uh you know there'll be any grant money available to support a U.S up dredge purchasing a single community so and he emphasized that's really what the county's therefore and that's and that's why they bought a second dredge I'm a year or so\nAgo to uh to be able to keep up with with uh the regional needs of the community\nThey had the Cape cod chronicled Tim thanks for that thank you Steve\nPatrick Cassidy is with me from the Cape cod times Patrick the state is looking to expand its sharp research effort\nThere's one study going on now that it's nearing the end\nYou know this is the study that a lot of people have heard about a Dr Gregory ... who's a with the state division of Marine Fisheries has been working with the Atlantic white shark conservancy than the non profit out of Chatham\nOr to do with population study to try and figure out how many uh white sharks are around obviously this is important for a number of reasons um you know to to understand the public safety implications here we we obviously just had a fatal shark attack here on the Cape for the first time\nI'm you know population seems to be growing shark population population certainly seems to be growing in their their ... tagging these sharks tracking these sharks recording these sharks and trying to to extrapolate from all that data\nOr the size of the population there checking on other things as well um so that's been moving forward and during that five year population study the the state essentially said that no other research could be done\nUm in the waters around the Cape and and that rubs some folks the wrong way um the oath search of folks who some people will know they they do a different type of of work they have a large ship\nAnd they've been here and they they basically hook the sharks and pulled them out of the water so they can attach\nA tax and do some some biological research on them and they were essentially told you can't do what you're doing here because of the way they do it they they ... the waters to attract destruction before they hook them and the concern was that that would affect the population study in effect the behavior of the sharks and affect the outcome of of a ... study\nUm and so that studies almost studies coming to an end and uh the division of Marine Fisheries\nOr through a director David peers are said last week that you know request for for white shark research in in these waters will be considered according to how they further state objectives so there's obviously a lot of wiggle room for the state there to to decide what they want to have go forward or not\nBut it did seem like the state is now open to other research projects they did in say very specifically that the idea of ... in the water for sharks is not going to work and they're not going to allow that but\nThat doesn't preclude or somebody like a Chris Fisher who runs oh search from coming in and and hooking up with sharks and doing what he does and he has said that he you know because of the amount of sharks that are here and that kind of density of the population\nThat he thinks he can do it without charming or the waters and he can do it with basically just the hawks so again it it'll be interesting\nTalked about making sure that it was a collaborative and making sure that whatever or somebody like go searching there could be others who want to come in and do research but whatever group liquid search does is done in collaboration with the state\nObviously Craig's ... is a is with the state and so it would be done in in collaboration with his uh efforts as well so we'll see how it goes forward but it looks like there's going to be other researchers who are going to be out there looking at our white sharks\nSearch a company has a very high profile listeners may remember they they can sharks that you can actually follow then online they some of those shots they maintain a Twitter account for them so you can see where they are as and it's brought in a lot of research data about how far sharks travel and raise some\nConsternation there are people who look at that type of thing and and what they call the anthropomorphic ... of the sharks and and raise concerns about how that could affect the perception of of sharks and and when you know in fact it's a a potentially dangerous animal\nUm you know other people certainly say that that that gets people engaged and gets people aware\nAnd and also provides again or the highlights the these animals and highlights it kind of how they fit into the ecosystem and and all the science that's involved there so a lot of different sides of this obviously even more important now that we've had a few attacks this summer one where somebody died\nAnd tragic drowning this week highlights how will where people need to be when using advocate\nBeaches yeah and this is this is something that I was thinking about with the with the death with the shark attack um I think a lot of people are really unaware as to how dangerous the waters on the outer Cape can be even without the sharks and we've for years I've been covering you know different things that happened in these waters\nI'm but these types of drownings like what happened here there was a twenty seven year old man\nUm they are also the ones who are saying\nListen you relied on data that basically the hospitals provided you so you you this is I think they called it the Fox guarding the hand hound them at one point and and the fact that this data was coming directly from the hospitals\nUm we we had a an editorial board with both the nurses association I Believe last weekend with a hospital officials from Cape Cod healthcare this week\nUh and they talked about how uh this is not going to be a really necessary and was going to be a real problem for them and and specifically hospitals of the size of Cape Cod hospital unfounded hospital we're going to see this is a real issue and and the study that that the Massachusetts a health policy commission\nOr did seem to back that up that those particular types of hospitals to the community hospitals um would really be hit hard and and that had a lot to do with the amount of Medicare and Medicaid patients that they take\n'em and so they said to do that to keep cut healthcare Cape Cod hospital found with us but they are going to require to meet these mandates two hundred and fifty additional nurses and it was going to cost thirty two\nThis this was Michael off the CEO of Cape Cod healthcare telling us this at this at board um and and he said you know we we only come out with where nonprofit we come out Eighteen million dollars ahead say on a given year that's going to go away and then we're going to need to come up with another sixteen plus million dollars or to meet this mandate\nAnd and we're gonna have to cut places\nA law was not a you know specific then we asked about what would be cut I mean there's a lot of talk about oh the emergency you're not gonna be able to go to the emergency room and he brought that up a couple of times and and and we pushed one then said so you're talking about closing down the emergency room and he said no no we're not going to do that so\nAs far as the specifics about what ... what is actually going to happen or it's not clear I mean he was saying well we don't want to like\nTell people that are going to lose their job before it's it's necessary to tell them that\nUm but he was basically insisting that they were going to be jobs lost and laid out what most business owners know that when you hire an employee or more employees\nYou have to pay their benefits and you have to hire enough to cover vacation and sick days and all those other things that employees need to take I think he was saying to hire three employees really have to hire a four point six to cover those sorts of things\nAgain that's a basic business practice um but the point that he was making at the hospital executives are making is that it's going to be costly and it's going to have other effects this health policy commission report um I think a wind up with their argument\nAnd again raised a lot of questions for the uh proponents of question one who who really see it as a way to get better outcomes in hospitals is to have more nurses on stuff\nThis is the news roundup I'm Steve Juncker with us from Cape Cod times Patrick Cassidy we're going to the break now when we come back we'll speak with George Brennan at Martha's Vineyard times there's more than a

move one or take it home you've got an article this week alerting folks did the laws around this\n[noise] that's right and we had a couple of incidents here um with this recently uh one of them in West has very\nWhere I'm a there was a twenty two year olds who was very interested in us he happens to have a background in in research and he wanted to drag it to his property [noise] uh but um [noise] you know the police are well actually someone on the beach saw him doing this\nThey stay alert the police\nAnd um [noise] you know the police came out and they talk to him and they said look you can't you can't do this you can't and now he was very polite about it and I'm understood um but there was another incident about a year ago and this one was an average town I'm actually happened on ...\nAnd we have a picture of it from uh the trustees reservations and it looks like a surf board in the back of the a pickup truck\nUm but actually it's a well done and how they stopped the picture they grabbed a partial plate and they were able to track down this one to a house in town they went out and talk to the individual\nAnd they didn't press charges a\nBut they they told them look you could have faced a ... you could have faced both criminal charges and a a pretty hefty fine uh for taking that off the beach so it is something if you see them out there there there\nThat I should say uh but you should leave him there and uh this all came about Steve it was interesting a couple of weeks ago we had a story\nThe trustees have put a um skull of a rite North Atlantic right

George thanks for joining us this morning\nThanks Steve and uh go socks\nSex we'll see what happens then I\nWith me from the Cape cod times Patrick Cassidy Patrick the towns of Dennis in ... have been at odds for some time over house costs they're divided between them in their joints school districts now it seems they're working out ... they could resolve some of the issues in this fight goes\nFor a decade or more than that really this is a they have the shared regional school district in and for years ... has had to uh go to its voters and ask for additional money I'm through proposition two and a half overrides or to pay\nOn a enrollment basis who has X number of students pays per student um and that really has been something that Yarmuth has struggled with now interesting enough Yarmuth was the town that had asked to go to the current formula that's used back in two thousand and six\nI'm so they're kind of dealing with the the the fruit of their own efforts here um but as part of this conversation interesting enough\nThat the two sides dislike men from the dentist and Yarmuth a select min boards have been met last week and seemed to have come to a compromise on a couple of different things\nOne with the dentist uh slugging and committed to partially reimburse Yarmuth for seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars that was for a study or about the renovation of ... middle school in West Yarmuth which is a school that's had a lot of problems\nUm that resulted in a recommendation to basically build a new regional middle school for students I'm a four to seven uh and so they said they'd they'd pay for part of that study um and they also said they'd be willing to potentially compromise on a couple of changes to that regional agreement which lays out how each a town pays for their students\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to WBAI your local news and information source for the Cape the coast and the island's Ninety point one WBAI end WBAI HD wind Woods Hole Martha's

L. like the Pearl and they're wonderful to there's ... there's Michelangelo's need\nDavid Hammond on Martha's Vineyard naming his alpaca\nAngelica and Angelina hot shot a hot shot if you go actually Israel man\nAnd you're listening to WC a\nWelcome back this is the news round up on the point we're discussing the top local news stories of the week I'm Steve Juncker joining me from the Cape cod times is Patrick Cassidy and on the phone with us now from the Cape cod chronicle is him would good morning Tim\nGood morning Steve Tim both Chatham in Orleans have raised the idea of the towns buying their own dredge as a piece of equipment that the town's could use when they want\nYou to the great article looking at what the costs are actually involved in purchasing a dredging operating in and it's a lot more money than most people seem to have considered\n[noise] yeah it's pretty eye opening when you when you look at the figures um you know both a charming her which is a need for dredging numerous times especially Chatham hum as we talked about um recently um there's just a lot of showing a lot of a fan of who's around inch adamant to keep to navigate\nA to keep the waterways applicable um the county dredges here quite often and that's what most towns on the Cape or for pretty much all the towns on the Cape rely on for their dredging needs a which is the ... county dredge they actually own to dredges which provide that service really at a a much ...\nFor commercial dredges um [noise] but those dredges a really busy I'm In a between whether and and blackout periods for for protecting certain species that can get competitive to secure a spot on the county dredge schedule and that's why one of the reasons Chatham and Orleans have both looked at\nThe uh the efficacy of purchasing their own dredges 'em and you know it's like you said Steve it sounds good [noise]\nUm to have a drag on hand when it's needed but the reality is that it really doesn't make financial sense for an individual town to own a dredge um Marshall County administrator or jak in you know it is a told us that uh you know the annual operating expenses for the county top one point five million dollars\nIn a while the county generally brings in enough revenue to cover that costs that doesn't always happen [noise]\nUm because of a you know whether and and things like that um when the dredge has just can't operate and so they they do have to have a reserve fund to to make up that a revenue [noise] um but uh and analysis done by chat rooms coastal resources department\nEstimated that just the cost of purchasing a dredge would be more than a three and a half million dollars and or the dredge itself is is it about a million and a half\nBut there's a lot of equipment that that needs to go along with it in order to make it operational such as ah pumps a heavy equipment to move or a pipes around and and those pipelines\nCan be pretty expensive here in Chatham they often have to a pump sand or that stretched a you know thousands of feet and and that can run into a lot of money for those pipelines\n[noise] a coastal resources director tech can he basically he said you know we can't just by dredge we have to buy all this equipment that goes along with it\nBut ah probably the more significant costs you know capital costs can be a amateur us over a number of years but\nUh the one of the most more significant costs a um we were told was that um to keep a crew on hand to run a dredge\nIs going to cost a seven to eight hundred thousand dollars a year [noise] um there's it's it's usually a five member crew and those people have to be kept on staff all year round even when the judges idle in the winter or during other periods\nAnd there's also a annual maintenance costs according to ah you noticed that are are are are can be pretty significant um last ah this past a few months the judges are both the county judges were and shot him and there were unable to operate because they were having maintenance problems and and that went on\n... Marshall County administrator or added that to you know the state has\nReally encourages towns to work together on regional levels and he doubts that uh you know there'll be any grant money available to support a ... a drudge purchasing a single community\nSo and he emphasized that's really what the county's therefore that's and that's why they bought a second dredge a year or so ago to uh to be able to keep up with with uh the regional needs of the communities\n[noise] Tim would end to Cape Cod chronicled Tim thanks for that thank you Steve\nAfter Cassidy is with me from the Cape cod times Patrick this state is looking to expand its sharp research efforts there was one study going on now that it's nearing the end you know this is the\nStudy that a lot of people have heard about a Dr Gregory ... who's a with the state division of Marine Fisheries has been working with the Atlantic which struck conservancy than the non profit out of Chatham\nOr just do a population study to try and figure out how many are white sharks are around obviously this is important for a number of reasons um you know to to understand the public safety implications here we we obviously just had a fatal shark attack you're on the case for the first time I'm\nIn a population seems to be growing shark population\nPopulation certainly seems to be growing and their their tagging sharks tracking these sharks recording these sharks and trying to to extrapolate from all that data or the size of the population there checking on other things as well um so that's been moving forward and during that five year population study the the state essentially said that no other research could be done\nUm in the waters around the Cape uh and and that rubs some folks the wrong way um the oath search of folks who who some people will know they they do a different type of of work they have a large ship\nAnd they've been here and they they basically hook the sharks and pulled them out of the water so they can attach\nA tax and do some some biological research on them and they were essentially told you can't do what you're doing here because of the way they do it they they ... the waters to attract destruction before they hook them and the concern was that that would affect the population study in effect the behavior of the sharks and affect the outcome of of a ... study\nUm and so that studies almost studies coming to an end and the division of Marine Fisheries\nOr through director David peers are said last week that you know request for for white shark research in in these waters will be considered according to how the further state objectives so there's obviously a lot of wiggle room for the state there to to decide what they want to have go forward or not\nBut it did seem like the state is now open to other research projects they did\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support WBAI at Cape and islands dot org\nHooking up with sharks and doing what he does and he has said that he you know because of the amount of trucks that are here and the the kind of density of the population\nThat he thinks he can do it without charming or the waters and he can do it with with basically just a hooks so again it it'll be interesting to see the there's also a was a lot of talk about making sure that it was collaborative and making sure that whatever or somebody like those sorts and there could be others who want to come in and do research but whatever\nGroup like were searched does is done in collaboration with the state obviously Greg ... is a is with the state and so it would be done in in collaboration with his uh efforts as well so we'll see how it goes forward but it looks like there's going to be other researchers who are going to be out there are looking at our white sharks\nSearch a company has a very high profile listeners may remember they they can't sharks that you can actually followed an online made some of those shots they maintain a Twitter account for them so you can see where they are as and it's brought in a lot of research data about how far sharks travel and raise some\nConsternation there are people who look at that type of thing and and what they call the anthropomorphic ... of the sharks and and raise concerns about how that could affect the perception of of sharks and and when you know in fact it's a a potentially dangerous animal um you know other people certainly say that\nThat that gets people engaged and gets people aware and and also\nProvides again or the highlights the these animals and highlights kind of how they fit in to the ecosystem and and all the science that's involved there so a lot of different sides to this obviously even more important now that we've had a few attacks this summer one where somebody died\nAnd tragic drowning this week highlights how where people need to be when using advocate beaches yeah and this is this\nThat I was thinking about with the with the death with the shark attack um I think a lot of people are really on aware as to how dangerous the waters on the outer Cape can be even without the sharks and we've for years I've been covering you know different things that happened in these waters\nOn but these types of drownings like what happened here there was a twenty seven year old man who was on a Boston beach\nIt was also a lot bigger than the forty seven million dollar cost estimates put forward by the Massachusetts nurses association they're the ones who wrote this a ballot initiative um they are also the ones who are saying\nListen you relied on data that basically the hospitals provided you so you you this is I think they called it the Fox guarding the hen house at one point and and the fact that this data was coming directly from the hospitals\nUm we we had a an editorial board with both the nurses association I Believe last weekend with a hospital officials from Cape Cod healthcare this week\nUh and they talked about how uh this is not going to be a really necessary and was going to be a real problem for them and and specifically hospitals of the size of Cape Cod a hospital and found that hospital we're going to see this is a real issue\nIt's just it's a health policy commission or did seem to back that up to those particular types of hospitals to the community hospitals um would really be hit hard and and that has a lot to do with the amount of Medicare and Medicaid patients that they take\n'em and so they said to do that to keep that healthcare keep hospital found with us but they're going to require to meet these mandates two hundred and fifty additional nurses and it was going to cost thirty two point four million dollars or to do this this was Michael lost the CEO of Cape Cod healthcare telling us this at this at board\nUm and and he said you know we we only come out with a nonprofit we come out Eighteen million dollars ahead say on a given year that's going to go away and then we're going to need to come up with another sixteen plus million dollars or to meet this mandate\nAnd and we're going to have to cut places\nA law was not a you know specific than we asked about what would be caught I mean there's a lot of talk about oh the emergency you're not gonna be able to go to the emergency room and he brought that up a couple of times and and and we pushed them on and said so you're talking about closing down the emergency room and said no no we're not going to do that so as far as the specifics about what ... what is actually going to happen\nOr it's not clear I mean he was saying well we don't want to like\nTell people that are going to lose their job before it's it's necessary to tell them that um but he was basically insisting that they're going to be jobs lost and laid out what most business owners know that when you hire an employee or more employees you\nHave to pay their benefits and you have to hire enough to cover vacation and sick days and all those other things that employees need to take I think he was saying to hire three employees really have to hire a four point six to cover those sorts of things\nUm again that's a basic business practice um but the point that he was making at the hospital executives are making is that's going to be costly and it's going to have other affects this health policy commission report um I think a wind up with their argument\nAnd again raised a lot of questions for the proponents of question one who who really see it as a way to get better outcomes in hospitals is to have more nurses on stuff\nThis is the news roundup I'm Steve Juncker with us from the Cape cod times Patrick Cassidy we're going to the break now when we come back we'll speak with George Brennan at Martha's Vineyard times there's more than a moment\nIs it going this American Life produces every case was following Senator Jeff flake during the days before

at times is Patrick Cassidy and on the line with us from the Martha's Vineyard times as George Brennan good morning George\nGood morning Steve and good morning Patrick\nGood morning George George Whale Bones Are fascinating when they ... wash up on the beach or you can run into real trouble if you try to move one or take it home you've got an article this week alerting folks did the laws around this\n[noise] that's right and we had a couple of incidents here with us it recently uh one of them in West to spray\nWhere I'm a there was a twenty two year olds who was very interested in the sea happens to have a background in and research and he wanted to drag it to his property [noise]\nUh but um [noise] you know the police are well actually someone on the beach saw him doing this that they learn it the police\nAnd um [noise] you know the police came out and they talk to him and they said look you can't you can't do this cat and ah he was very polite about it and I'm understood um but there was another incident about a year ago and this one was an average town I'm actually happen on choppy\nAnd we have a picture of it from uh the trustees reservations and it looks like a surf board in the back of the pickup truck um but actually it's a well known\nThey grabbed a partial plate and they were able to track down this one to a house in town they went out and talk to the individual and they didn't press charges a\nBut they they told them look you could have faced or you could have face both criminal charges and a a pretty hefty fine uh for taking that off the beach so it is something you see them out there they're they're pretty to look at um interesting to look at I should say uh but you should leave him there\nAnd uh this all came about Steve it was interesting a couple of weeks ago we had a story the trustees have put a um\nSkull of a rite North Atlantic right well dear the bridge on Chappaquiddick and it's become sort of a a thing that people go in and look at nobody could possibly move this but it's been chain down just to make sure nobody attempts\nAt George there was a suicide awareness and prevention walk on the island it took place on a beach before

saying is you know\nWe need to bring these into the light we need more understanding we need we need to help people um in advance and so\nA a nice event uh getting people together and and really doing a great job of raising awareness for suicide\nGeorge Brennan at the Martha's Vineyard times George thanks for joining us this morning\nThank Steve and um go socks\nSex and we'll see what happens then I with me from the game got times Patrick Cassidy Patrick the towns of Dennis in ... had been at odds for some time\nJoin the school districts now it seems they're working out the equipment they could resolve some of the issues and this fight goes on for a decade or more than that really this is a they have the shared regional school district in and for years\n... has had to uh go to its voters and ask for additional money I'm through proposition two and a half overrides or to pay for their share\nIt's basically done on a enrollment basis who has X number of students pays per student um and that really has been something that Yarmuth has struggled with now interesting enough Yarmuth was the town that had asked to go to the current formula that's used back in two thousand and six\nI'm so they're kind of dealing with the the the fruit of their own efforts here\nUm but as part of this conversation interesting enough that the two sides of this like men from the dentist and Yarmuth a select been boards have been met last week and seemed to have come to a compromise on a couple of different things\nOne was a dentist a selection and committed the partially reimburse Yarmuth for seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars that was for a study a about the renovation of ... middle school in West Yarmuth which is a school that's had a lot of problems\nUm that result in a recommendation to basically build a new regional middle school for students I'm a four to seven\nUh and so they said they they pay for part of that study um and they also said they'd be willing to potentially compromise on a couple of changes to that regional agreement which lays out how each a town pays for their students", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Point", "city": "Brewster", "day":
