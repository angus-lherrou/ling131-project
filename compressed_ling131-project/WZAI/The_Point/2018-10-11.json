considerable virtues of bringing our money back down to earth not all that of course but enough to matter\nSo wow that's a mouthful welcome to mouthful on purpose yes All right so\nA modern day um food system is follow the path of industrialization more efficient methods larger scale production a global network of markets\nAnd for most economists and business owners growth is a hallmark of success but you like to quote economists if she micro who wisely noted quote unlimited growth on a finite planet is an impossibility talk a little bit more about this alternative\nI don't know why don't why don't we start with like a big question yeah it is quite simple it's an important question well I'm I'm really glad you started there because I actually see what we're doing with little money as being a lot about a lot more than just the local food part the food part is the action that's what we're doing together but the conversation is really is a much bigger one about\nYou know do you believe the world economy can just keep going towards more and more faster and faster and more and more global bigger and bigger financial institutions I mean does that more and more derivatives I mean come on do we really think that's going to solve everything\nBut but we're not that I we are not against that it's just a I feel strongly that betting everything on that alone is not a very prudent thing to do so it's time to try to rebalance and got a lot more small things going\nAnd so for those who haven't thought about where our food comes from give us an overview of the industrialization of\nOh dear [laughter] um [noise] you know probably the poster child for the industrialization of food or hug confinement units and\nIt's a it's not a pleasant place to start a conversation but but it's a real thing and we have to pay attention to real thing so you know if you if you imagine\nLet's say five or ten thousand hogs confined in little bar for almost like little cells shot full of antibiotics on let's say into Barnes may be that take up a half an acre of land\n[noise] ah well this is why I call it slow Monday and nurture capital and not you know philanthropy plus or a venture capital minus maybe we just need new language to talk about this uh what we are using what I Would call old twentieth century\nUh this is a hybrid of investing in philanthropy and you can talk about where it fits in there\nUm because slow money isn't one thing which is the beauty of it some of it's more philanthropic someone felt like I mentioned some people some of us are doing donations than using the capitals makes your present loans well that's\nPretty darn philanthropic but we're still investing because we're giving loans that are going to recycle and going to go to future farmers about giving the money away it's not pure ...\nSo I think the answer is it's a blend and it's up to the individual investor to assess for him or herself\nHow they understand the risks how they understand the benefit but again if it's hyper local there's enough innate value there when people are looking at each other and you want that for him to be there I think you can kind of figure out because of what makes sense [laughter]\nEight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number if you'd like to chime in the morning eight six six nine nine nine for six to six

their values some people value wealth they'll probably never be convinced otherwise do you think we need to convert everyone or is it I mean how many people do we need to to get sinking in these terms to make\nThis one I don't actually think in terms of convincing people to do anything uh and I have had the the the privilege of of talking to many many thousands of people over the last ten years in\nMeetings large and small all around the country and sometimes outside of the U.S and I am convinced that there are millions of people who\nAre are indirectly participating in the conversation or want it to end the conversation you and I are having right now now sometimes I describe it as millions of people who believe Wendell Berry is right now that gets into who who the heck is Wendell Berry\nUm but uh so I think the job is to mobilize the millions of us who share these concerns to actually take some of our money and do what we quote\nKnow or believe is right doesn't matter you know are we right I mean what's right and wrong who the heck knows but we believe it's we want there to be more small and midsized organic farms in our community I think it's important to keep bringing it back to that over and over again [noise]\nOf the reasons for that have to do with soil and water and air and community and culture agriculture as opposed to agribusiness all these things these are it's like a whole ... series of things if you believe that and I know there are millions of people who do\nThan we have to act especially now I'm going to ... return to that un report it's not like it's the first one that ever came out [noise]\nBut uh we were gabbing before the show but you know there's been going on for fifty or sixty years in the current form of modern environmental awareness\nWe just got a roller sleeves up and do it even more now ah and I'm all about slow and so it's complicated we need slow money fast I Know it's a little little funny but but we do and and uh I don't think it's about convincing people I think it's about engaging people who already share a certain set of values to go for it\nAnd say education like like we're thinking about where food is coming from as you were talking earlier about the hogs and and I couldn't get him to be feeding 'cause it's kind of like how people don't want to know how they made a hat on\n... you know sausages or whatever that about you don't want to see how the song yeah being made and about money like where's our money going it's all being put into a hotdog derivative hotdog somewhere and sold off and you know it's it's a lot to contemplate but just keep coming\nLittle bit of our lives and now more than ever this food thing raises consciousness books were putting carbon into the why we haven't really talked about that about one piece a little bit we did when we talked about plowing before\nThis is a carbon thing just on that level alone you know what ... million Americans put one percent of their money a year into local foods as I Know it's\nAwfully simplistic to put it that way but if you just let your imagination go a little bit the carbon implications of that the local community implications healthy food in the schools implications water implications meant a lot of stuff [noise]\nUm so I Want to keep going in that\nDirection Christine is calling us She's visiting the Cape from Portland Maine Hi Christine\nGood morning I'm I guess that's why if you had done any research from last year and I got that come on and stuff like that that ties\nLike car wait till I a sugar I'm at a cost to help that factor that I have a conversation at either on your part and some of your research\nA that's a that's a a whole\nLittle mini economic industry going on what's called true cost accounting and so if you're really interested in that there was a conference held a few years ago called the true cost of American food that was held in San Francisco doesn't matter where it was\nBut if you Google that you'll get a report that that they did and I literally due to a lot of other stuff so yeah there's a whole bunch of people I I don't work directly on that because I'm so focused on just connecting local investors directly to local farmers\nAnd let's say not getting bogged down with a lot of academic metrics and other things which become very important when you're working at the national policy level but when you're the local level they're not as important but the point you're raising is a very good one um [noise]\nAll of the current sort of alternative economic work that's being done his around that issue that we've sort of ex turn allies the long term social and environmental costs in order to get a cheap stuff that is what you're basically saying it's the same thing in food as in other areas\nAnd thank you ... for the call eight six six nine nine nine for six to six if you have a question or comment for eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org\nSo let's say someone's listening right now and four one K. um money's invested for them but they want to be they would like they like this idea of investing in their community how do they get started\nWell for for us first of all the money the answer is kind of awkward um you know he's got a few dozen groups around the country so if you're if you're asking it that way\nThe groups are safe there's one near you but there's only a few dozen dots and it's a big countries that's not totally satisfactory answer [noise]\nUm [noise] for the food answer I Would say um [noise] see essays community supported agriculture is an interesting thing because it is kind of a hybrid\nConsumer and investing thing meaning if you give some money to a local farmer at the beginning of the season in exchange for a share of the produce that's part an investment it's a you know you're getting food and returned but as you're giving them capital they need at the beginning of the season and you're getting food back over time\nBut it's not an investment the way you're asking I I Would say um there's there's no like we don't have a cookie cutter thing for them in fact we are part of this movement there so that the local investing movement is a thing\nUm [noise] uh the JOBS Act different things are making it somewhat easier for people to begin to invest locally but we are very early and if there's very there's basically no easy structures set up for you\nCan you share a story of a of a farm or a farmer who received a capital investment through this low money networking and how it changed or enhance their work\nYes um I mean unfortunately too many of those stories like the ... which one Chinatown yeah I don't know well I I use one tip typically because it is such a beautiful story and I can only convey the tiniest bit of it but we\nAt a big national event we did in Louisville in twenty fourteen Wendell Berry was there and it was pretty beautiful thing um we ... we featured a bunch of a small food enterprise from around the country we had a competition\nFor what we called beat decline not the queen bee decline we liked to have a little fun on by the way you haven't mention anything about the poetry and my book which leads to the question of wordplay but okay we'll leave that aside for now so we had to beat quaint campaign\nYeah I think the farmers markets and I I Love the farmer's markets and you know there's some that are more fun than the others it's like the one on the vineyard that's got to be ... or the one in Boulder, Colorado is pretty amazing and I started like the locally that one on the vineyard is there's always some kind of band they're playing it's like an event you know the kids playgrounds right there\nBut there's a lot more competition because there's a lot more farmers markets locally right so that's got to be a little bit of a challenge\nIt is to challenge the the amount of money going into local food to farmers' markets is not necessarily change but there are more farmers markets so farmers individually or not making as much money at those markets\nAnd there are costs to attending the market be packing staff to be there um time off the farm if the farmer themselves as the one doing the selling\nSo we want to make sure that we're strategic in starting new markets everybody loves the idea of having a new one um I think we need to find the best places find the successes and stick with those\nOne of the new inputs in to Massachusetts agriculture this year though has been what we started talking about before the show the healthy incentives program which is part of um\nWho is on snap which is what we call food stamps now um is allowed a certain amount of money per month um spent at farmers' markets farm stands or in sea essays to be used on local food so this is an investment through the department of transitional assistance and also supported by the department of agriculture resources\nUm and the amount of money that has gone into this program that goes to provide food to people in these under served communities and then an economic benefit to the farmers has been an incredible boost him it's such a great program where we went for everybody it exactly how do we see that that was where do you know what do you have\nTo ... I I'm pretty sure that's a National League there there are some are really beautiful NGOs that have been very effective in advocating for for that program [noise]\nEight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number that's eight six six nine nine nine for six to six or email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org we'll talk more after a break\nFrom Lawrence world\nNext time on studio three sixty [noise]\nLearning to love the show your grandparents may do you watch [noise]\nI think ... is corny and that's part of what spray\nOne and I do a\nBetter next time on studio ... three sixty this afternoon it to Montgomery the eye\nSupport for W.

why don't we start with like a big question yeah this is a question simple it's an important question well I'm I'm really glad you started there because I actually see what we're doing with little money as being a lot about it a lot more than just the local food part the food part is the action that's what we're doing together but the conversation is really is a much bigger one about\nYou know do you believe the world economy can just keep going towards more and more faster and faster and more and more global bigger and bigger financial institutions I mean does that more and more derivatives I mean come on do we really think that's going to solve everything [noise]\nBut but we're not I we are not against that it's just a I feel strongly that betting everything on that alone is not a very prudent thing to do so it's time to try to rebalancing ... got a lot more small things going\nAnd so for those who haven't thought about where our food comes from give us an overview of the industrialization of food\nOh dear [noise] um [noise] you know probably the poster child ...\nUnits and it's a it's not a pleasant place to start a conversation but but it's a real thing and we have to pay attention to real thing so you know if you if you imagine\nLet's say five or ten thousand hogs confined in little bar ... almost like little cells shot full of antibiotics\nThe investment certainly um we're investing in our our health and wellbeing but should we also expect to get a monetary return on investment\n[noise] ah well this is why I call it slow Monday to nurture capital and not you know friends or B plus or a venture capital minus maybe we just need a new language to talk about this um [noise] what we are using what I Would call old the twentieth century financial language [laughter]\nUh this is a hybrid of investing in philanthropy and you can talk about where it fits in there [noise]\nUm because slow money isn't one thing which is the beauty of it some of it's more philanthropic someone felt like I mentioned some people some of us are doing donations than using that capital to make zero percent loans well that's pretty darn philanthropic\nBut we're still investing because we're giving loans that are going to recycle and going to go to future farmers without giving the money away it's not ...\nSo I think the answer is it's a blend and it's up to the individual investor to assess for him or herself\nHow they understand the risk how they understand the benefit but again if it's hyper local there's enough innate value there when people are looking at each other and they want that for him to be there I think you can kind of figure out kind of what makes sense now\nEight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number if you'd like to chime in this morning eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our\nEmail address is the point at Cape and islands dot org we'll have more with somebody Tasha after a short break [noise] five\nThis

love song to his wife Jamie Italy [noise]\n\nIt it\nUh or\nOr listening to the Cape and dial NPR stations\nYou're listening to the point we're talking with attached his new book is soil notes toward the theory and practice of nurture capital eight six six nine nine nine for six to six that's eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org\nMission related investing a it's an appeal for people to invest in their values some people value wealth they'll probably never be convinced otherwise do you think we need to convert everyone or is it I mean how many people do we need to to get sinking in these terms to make\nThis one I don't actually think in terms of convincing people to do anything uh and I have had the the the privilege of of talking to many many thousands of people over the last ten years in\nMeetings large and small all around the country and sometimes outside of the U.S [noise] and I am convinced that there are millions of people who\nAre are indirectly participating in the conversation or want to end the conversation you and I are having right now now sometimes I describe it as millions of people who believe Wendell Berry is right now that gets at that who who the heck is Wendell Berry\nUm but uh so I I think the job is to mobilize the millions of us who share these concerns to actually take some of our money and do what we quote\nKnow or believe is right doesn't matter how are we right I mean what's right and wrong who the heck knows but we believe it's we wanted to be more small and midsized organic farms in our community I think it's important to keep bringing it back to that over and over again [noise]\nOf the reasons for that have to do with soil and water and air and community\nAnd culture agriculture as opposed to agribusiness all these things are it's like a whole ... if you believe that and I know there are millions of people who do than we have to act especially now I'm going to ... returned to the un report it's not like it's the first one that ever came out [noise]\nBut uh we were gabbing before the show but you know there's been going on for fifty or sixty years in the current form of modern environmental awareness [noise]\nWe just got a roller sleeves up and do it even more now ah and I'm all about slow so it's complicated we need slow money fast I Know it's a little funny but but we do and and uh I don't think it's not convincing people I think it's about engaging people who already share a certain set of values to go for it\nAnd say education I was thinking about where food is coming from as you were talking earlier about the hogs\nIt's kind of like how people don't want to know how they made that had um\nWell you know sausages whatever that about you don't want to see how the sun yeah being made and about money like where's our money going it's all being put into hotdog derivative hotdog somewhere and sold off and you know it's it's a lot to contemplate but just keep coming back to the basic thing if we can take control of a little bit of our lives and now\nMore than ever this food thing raises consciousness because we're putting carbon into this why we haven't really talked about that that one piece a little bit we did when we talked about plowing before\nThis is a carbon thing just on that level alone you know what ... million Americans put one percent of their money a year into local foods as I Know it's\nAwfully simplistic to put it that way but if you just let your imagination go a little bit the carbon implications of that the local community implications healthy food in the schools implications water implications and it's a lot of stuff [noise]\nUm so I Want to keep going in that direction\nChristine is calling us She's visiting the Cape from Portland Maine Hi Christine\nGood morning I was wondering if you had done any research information and I I like that come on and stuff like that sucks it ties\nLike wait 'til like sugar I'm at a cost to help that factor for that conversation if either on your part and some of your research\nA that's a that's a a whole\nLittle mini economic industry going on what's called true cost accounting and so if you're really interested in that there was a conference held a few years ago called the true cost of American food is that it was held in San Francisco doesn't matter where it was\nBut if you Google that you'll get a report that that they did and I'm middle lead you to a lot of other stuff so yeah there's a whole bunch of people I I don't work directly on that because I'm so focused on just connecting local investors directly to local farmers\nAnd let's say not getting bogged down with a lot of academic metrics and other things which become very important when you're working at the national policy level but when you're the local level they're not as important but the point you're raising as a very good one um [noise]\nAll of the current sort of alternative economic work that's being done his around that issue that we've sort of external lies the long term social and environmental costs in order to get cheap stuff that is what you're basically saying it's the same thing in food as in other areas\nAnd thank you Christine for the call eight six six nine nine nine for six to six if you have a question or comment for it's eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support WC ay ay Cape and islands data work how did they get started\nWell for for us first of all the money the answer is kind of awkward um you always got a few dozen groups around the country so if you're if you're asking it that way I Would say go to the slow money at our website you'll see where the groups are safe there's one near you but there's only a few dozen dots and it's a big country that's not a totally satisfactory answer [noise]\nUm [noise] for the food answer I Would say um see essays community supported agriculture is an interesting thing because it is kind of a hybrid\n... consumer and investing thing meaning if you give some money to a local farmer at the beginning of the season in exchange for a share of the ... that's part an investment it's a you know you're getting food and returned but as you're giving them capital they need at the beginning of the season and you're getting food back over time\nBut it's not an investment the way you're asking I I Would say um there's there's no like we don't have a ... a cookie cutter thing for them in fact we are part of this movement there so that the local investing movement is a thing\nUm [noise] uh the JOBS Act different things are making it somewhat easier for people to begin to invest locally but we are very early in at this very there's basically no easy structures that up for yes\nCan you share a story of a of a farm or a farmer who received a capital investment through this low money networking and how it changed our enhanced in their work\nUm yes um I mean unfortunately too many of those stories vaccine which one do you know well I I use one ... typically because it is such a beautiful story and I can only convey the tiniest bit of it but we\nAt a big national about we did in Louisville in twenty fourteen Wendell Berry was there and it was pretty beautiful thing um we ... we featured a bunch of a small food enterprise from around the country we had a competition\nFor what we called bitcoin not between the decline and we'd like to have a little fun on by the way you haven't mentioned anything about the poetry in my book which leads to the question of wordplay but okay we'll leave that aside for now so we had to beat quaint campaign\nMaking investments back into the community when all of our farmers do yeah\nI think the farmers markets and I I Love the farmer's markets and you know there's some that are more fun than the others it's like the one on the vineyard that's got to be him or the one in Boulder, Colorado is pretty amazing as I started like the only that one on the vineyard is there's always some kind of band they're playing it's like an event you know the kids playgrounds right there\nBut there's a lot more competition because there's a lot more farmers markets locally right so that's got to be a little bit of a challenge\nIt is challenged the the amount of money going into local food to farmers' markets is not necessarily change but there are more farmers markets so farmers individually are not making as much money at those markets\nUm and there are costs to attending the market be packing staff to be there um time off the farm is the farmer themselves as the one doing the selling\nWish to Egypt and starting new markets everybody loves the idea of having a new one um I think we need to find the best places find the successes and stick with those\nOne of the new inputs in to Massachusetts agriculture this year though has been what we started talking about before the show the healthy incentive program which is part of um snap benefits um anyone who is on snap which is what we call food stamps now\nIs allowed a certain amount of money per month um spent at farmers' markets farm stands or in sea essays to be used on local food so this is an investment to the department of transitional assistance and also supported by the department of agricultural resources\nUm and the amount of money that has gone into this program that goes to provide food to people in these under served communities and then an economic benefit to the farmers has been an incredible boost yeah it's such a great ... win win for everybody it exactly huh it's\nDo we see that house where do you know what is that happened I I I'm\nPretty sure that's a National League there there are some are really beautiful NGOs that have been very effective in advocating for for that program\n[noise] eight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number that's eight six six nine nine nine for six to six or email address is the point at Cape

agricultural agriculture in a partnership\nEight six six nine nine nine for six to six to eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org Ron is calling from Brewster Hi Ron\nHello there I I'm\nReally welcome your program certainly on soil and um the business of being a local farmer I think I'm all of the issues that have been discussed are exceedingly important I've seen the benefit of the snap coupons that are farmers markets I also think that a more\nEducation is necessary in the areas of both farmers and consumers particularly in this zone six seven area where we aren't necessarily are raising a\nLot of crops that are very nutritious highly sustainable and utilize our soil and environmental resources\nMind your urine grill or you're a farmer\nI'm a grower in health care provider okay you have brings up that brings up the issue of uh\nIncentivizing and subsidizing agribusiness because so much of our diet which is available and routine major a distribution a sources is unhealthy so that while we are helping those uh agribusiness outlets where reducing uh apparently\nHealthcare benefits and raise a health care insurance benefits and raising premiums mhm so it's sort of like a static and not really helping the situation\nYeah well thanks for sharing your thoughts anyone coming in it\nWell I you know if you look at long term trends let's say or at least if you take fifty years and you look at a just a magic two lines one line is the cost of a American food in other words the amount of\nOn food a corollary number to that one same line would be the amount of each ... a consumer dollar spent on food that goes to a farmer and both of those lines start up on the upper left to go down to the lower right on the graph now there's another line across is that one and that's the cost of health care the percentage of health care that we spend\nAs part of the GDP I I was a uh worked in the venture capital industry briefly\nAt the beginning of my career and it was for healthcare Ventura fund and around that time health care was going from eleven to twelve percent of the GDP and everyone was kind of I I'm ... I'm doing this for dramatic effect because they weren't bad people but everyone is kind of rubbing their hands together going hey healthcare it's going to be a great place to invest in them\nAnd now we're up to them but something like Eighteen percent of the GDP in health care that's a percentage of the whole economy Mm that's not like you're on your percentage of what of our everything we have\nSo you have you know cheap food are more health care and events oversimplified a little those lines are real so yeah I mean we have to eat better and and this has to do with um a little bit that earlier call on external housing costs and whatnot because if you get cheap food\nSeems like a good thing for the short term but then you pay back for it and health care later Steve is calling from highlights Hi Steve\n[noise] I Know ... for many years ago on Nantucket they used to work at Sanford boat\nA woody eyes the ... I Believe in or stopping the external ... and Mike calling card is fisheries really but I did grow up the system\nFor a mega system food soil and recycle I think the systems where we tend to external lies all these costs out and let everyone pay so to speak that needs to be bundled and there's so many of these\nAnd the reason I chose food soil and recycled to bundle is one system is because\nThe common denominator is the cash register where we buy all\nThe food cetera [noise]\nSo we need to subsidize good soil and we need to stop\nPoisoning soil because it's killing us we need to stop a manufacturing a ridiculously uh because we don't have any materials handling system and recycling so we need standardized station in that area\nAnd it all has to be done with the incentives and penalties to my way of thinking and in the fisheries where I get most of my work was incentives for green fishing and penalties a trip fishing wasn't\nYou've got a tax everything that comes in and fisheries so\nSimply put with the food the recycle the soil systems at all has to be taxes and incentives to me and we can't we just can't afford to uh\nTo go on a subsidizing the bad which is what we do in the Eighteen percent of GDP while that incredible you know aren't buffet called it the tape for them I think\nSteve thanks for your thoughts you back on it\nOr that there's discussion of um of subsidies and penalties and regulatory reform ah obviously enormous topic um\nI sort of have a cop out response to that a little bit I'm just being honest for me and that's kind of daunting and complicated and and as a child of the sixties and seventies who again\nKind of listening to the un say hey guys we've been we've been we've all been talking about this fifty sixty years and you know insanity is doing the same thing over and over again hoping for different outcomes of yes we have to try to get rid of the bad subsidies it would be nice if there were good subsidies it would be nice if we could change taxes to to\nTo address the issues I Hope we can but I think the real action right now is just local\nDirect when when you are this is why the local part of local is important because when you're a direct relationship with what you're doing", "show_name": "The Point", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "11"}
