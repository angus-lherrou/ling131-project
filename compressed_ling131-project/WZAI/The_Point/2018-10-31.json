L. Stein you'll recognize him as the author of the goose bumps which my kids love to read the stories and he has written one story in this collection but it's twenty short stories and they are fine for kids\nUm and as he says every story starts with a screen that screams to kick off an entire book of screens and house and mystery and heart and frantic suspense and cries and the night\nWhen you read a book do you enjoy it cold tinkle of fear at the back of your neck a tense feeling that tightened every muscle in your body\nAnd makes you suddenly breathless\nYou've come to the right place so one of the stories in here is ice cream for ice cream and it is about this a brother and sister who have recently moved to this town and they hate the town and they really don't know anybody and a good friend of theirs is visiting there playing football with some neighborhood kids when they hear the ice cream\nA music coming and they're like all excited and the kids that they've been playing with slowly head toward home and the kids the original kids are left alone and they follow they find the ice cream truck but it's closed\nAnd the man running it gets out he's still there and he said oh go on and you can have whatever you want\nAnd they're a little surprised at this but they decide to go into the back of the trucking there enough is all this ice cream\nSo they start eating and around the the a truck on the inside or photos of kids and they're all fat and they all have this horrible look on their face a surprise but they ignore it and the night they go back because they're like drawn into this whole thing\nUntil the very last night when\nThey open the back door the truck to go out and there's the whole village with knives and forks and their hands waiting for the kids but it's a kids' book so it\nIs wild [laughter] he's been spilled\nSenate soak in and okay yeah that's pretty scary and I you know I always worry about that the nightmare is you know so you got a of a

then\n[noise] um does she have any more to say no also all she said the lottery and rose from well I had to that wouldn't be normally considered and the reason I chose Fahrenheit four fifty one is we did this and the book group at the store\nAnd when people commented on it I'd say a third of our group called the book scary and the scary element to it is um books are being burned the firemen don't put out fires they create fires\nBut there doesn't seem to be anybody in charge there's just this uh neighbors telling on each other and letting them out\nAnd as I was thinking about it and I thought yeah that is a scary story the outcome it does have a little bit of hope at the end but then I thought oh yeah the lottery and I can remember exactly where I was when I read it I mean at the book the story just absolutely stunned me\nAnd once again it's a story of people following a tradition or following directives as they do in Fahrenheit four fifty one\nWith no care or ... or ... it just says how we've always done it\nRead it and even though I knew the ending to the lottery it still showed me it doesn't has this chilling aspect to it\nAnd I'm In the end the story you know it just showed that it's nobody quite knows where it started or how it started a they do stay say Mr Adams said too old man Warner who stood next to him that over in the north village they're talking of giving up the lottery\nOld man Warner snorted pack of crazy fools he said listening to the young folks nothing good enough for them next thing you know there'll be wanting to go back to living in caves nobody

it's got like the scariest first pitch at first [noise]\nAnd I never read it before it's called I have no mouse and I must scream my Harlan Ellison and it was like this and Alison by the way was born in Nineteen thirty four\nLimp body of forest are hung from the pink palate unsupported hanging high above us in the computer chamber and it did not shiver in the chill oily breeze that blue internally through the main cavern the body hung head\nDown attached it ... to the underside of the palate by the soul of his right foot it had been drained of blood through a precise incision made from ear to ear under the lantern jaw\nThere was no blood on the reflective surface of the metal floor when ... joined our group and looked up at himself was already too late for us to realize that once again am am had duped us has had had it's fun it had been a\nDiversion on the part of the machine three of us had vomited turning away from one another and it reflects as ancient as the knowledge of that ad produced it of course when white it was almost as though he had seen him do I ... and was afraid of the future oh God he mumbled and walked away the three of us followed him after\nA time and found him sitting with his back\nTo one of the smaller shuttering banks his head in his hands Ellen knelt down beside him and stripped his hair he didn't move but his voice came out of his covered face

drinks a lot of line [laughter] and she watches old movies\nAnd she sits at her window observing everybody on the street and she knows the people across the street have moved out and new people have moved in [noise] um she lives alone but she's talking with her daughter and her husband frequently and that's kind of strange because they don't live with her and it does bring back\nMemories of rear window the movie but she is the infamous unreliable narrator and the book does have a call out from Stephen King\nOne of those rare books that really is and put down a bull delightful and chilling so as she's watching the neighborhood she thinks she sees the new family across the street the woman get murdered and she is trying to figure it out and of course when she calls the pollution reports that\nShe has no evidence and they really thinks she's crazy and you start thinking she's crazy she has rented an apartment in her basement to this man and he's a little strange to\nAnd when she does finally go out to try to figure things out you're like no no don't go out on this [laughter] so it's um [noise]\nSo this is sort of the science behind this and as the author notes in this enjoyable

L. Stein you'll recognize him as the author of the goose bumps which my kids love to love those stories and he has written one story in this collection but it's twenty short stories and they are fine for kids um and as he says\nEvery story starts with a screen that screams to kick off an entire book of screens and house and mystery and heart and frantic suspense and cries and the night\nWhen you read a book do you enjoy cold tangle of fear at the back of your neck a tense feeling that tightened every muscle in your body and makes you suddenly breathless\nYou've come to the right place so one of the stories in here is ice cream for ice cream and it is about this a brother and sister who have recently moved to this town and they hate the town and they really don't know anybody and a good friend of theirs is visiting there playing football with some neighborhood kids when they hear the ice cream\nA music coming and they're like all excited and the kids that they've been playing with slowly head toward home and the kids the original kids are left alone and they follow they find the ice cream truck but it's closed\nAnd the man running it gets out he's still there and he said oh go on and you can have whatever you want\nAnd they're a little surprised at this but they decide to go into the back of the trucking there enough resolve this ice cream\nSo they start eating and around the the a truck on the inside or photos of kids and they're all fat and they all have this horrible look on their face a surprise but they ignore it and the night they go back\nBecause they're like drawn into this whole thing\nUntil the very last night when they open the back door the ...\nKnives and forks and their hands waiting for the kids but it's a kids' book so it didn't\nWow [laughter] she's been spilled\nSenate joke and and okay yeah that's pretty scary and I you know I always worry about the the nightmare is you know so you got an ... of a certain age say kids with a certain age right I Would say this would be a middle school your little little to no ... at the library Joe we got you know Arthur is Halloween I'm a ... that was the name of it was All right and as of right\nAnd it at three pages and my grand is like it's too scary ah\nYeah careful I think that yeah that's in the alley [laughter] may is calling from province sound good morning Nate\nMorning guys um [noise] yeah I hate to go off the threat of of a\nChildren's um scary but or in the form of McCarthy's road oh my God yes hands down the most terrifying a book or any piece of media that I've ever encountered yes only time I've ever had to um on a dark and stormy night put a book down out of\n[laughter] I I agree with you it's got one of the most deprived characters in literature at in it it's yeah it's it's called the rows and rows of the road\nRoad the road or post apocalyptic story and some of the themes are are are just so vivid and terrifying that um that they're on their unbearable at times\n[laughter] my okay we're going to put that on our [laughter] and we should say we'll have a link to the list later today for folks are trying to keep track of all these books thanks for that suggestion that's a that's a good and we also have an email from Bonnie in dentist who says how about the lottery and rose for Emily oh that's your next book here All right we'll go ahead and tell us about it\nThen [noise] um does she have any more to the office all she said a lot of ... well I had to that wouldn't be normally considered and the reason I chose Fahrenheit four fifty one is we did this in the book group at the store\nAnd when people commented on it I'd say a third of our group called the book scary and the scary element to it is um books are being burned the firemen don't put out fires they create fires\nBut there doesn't seem to be anybody in charge there's just this uh neighbors telling on each other and letting them out and as I was thinking about it and I thought yeah that is a scary stories the outcome it does have a little bit of hope at the end but then I thought oh yeah the lottery and I can remember ...\nBook the story just absolutely stunned me and once again it's a story of people following a tradition or following directives as they do in Fahrenheit four fifty one\nWith no care or ... or ... this is how we've always done it and so I ... and I re read it and even though I knew the ending to the lottery it still chilled me it doesn't has this chilling aspect to it\nAnd I'm In the in the story you know to just show that it's nobody quite knows where it started or how it started a they do stay say Mr Adams said too old man Warner who stood next to him that over in the north village they're talking of giving up the lottery\nOld man Warner snorted pack of crazy fools he said listening to the young folks nothing good enough for them next thing you know there'll be wanting to go back to living in caves nobody work anymore live that\nWay for a while used to be a saying about lottery in June corn be heavy soon first thing you know we'd all be eating stewed chick week an acorns\nThere's always been a lottery he said ... bad enough to see young Joe
