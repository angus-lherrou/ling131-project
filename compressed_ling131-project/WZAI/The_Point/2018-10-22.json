W. GBH radio Boston this is living lab radio I'm Heather Goldstone\nMuch has been said about the lack of science advice reaching the Trump Administration there's still no director of the White House office of science and Technology Policy as the person who usually serves as the president's top science advisor\nThe position of science and technology advisor to the secretary of state is also vacant and the EPA says it plans to eliminate the office of the science advisor to that agency's administrator\nBut it seems that the Trump Administration isn't the only one shining scientific advice the secretary general of the un Antonio ... has allowed his science advisory panel to lapse I'm joined now by two members of that panel\nSusan ... is president emeritus of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in addition to the un scientific advisory board she sits on the scientific advisory committees of Noah NASA the national Park Service and the national Research Council is global change research program\nSusan welcome back to the show it's been a while it's been awhile great to be here\nAlso with us as Maria even over she's an associate professor of conflict resolution human security and global governance at UMass Boston McCormack graduate school\nMaria welcome to the show thank you Maria let's start with you the scientific advisory board the un scientific advisory board was created in late twenties Thirteen early twenty fourteen by the un secretary general Ban Ki moon how did that board come about\nTo board came about on the recommendation of government ruled that level panel on global ability that former secretary general Ban Ki moon had created\nAnd the final outcome of a ... report that had several recommendations to the secretary general\nAnd one of them was to create\nA scientific advisor or a scientific advisory board who the secretary general of the United nations the decision then was to create a board\nThe United nations is a global bunny and having one person advise on science was seen as a ... having a very diverse and dynamic scientific advisory board with what's secretary general Ban Ki moon thoughts was necessary and he\nPointed at that time Thirteen men and Thirteen Women from various disciplines various countries and with various knowledge of science and policy to be scientific advisory board of the secretary general to the United\nTo step forward and need this scientific advisory work and the provided secretary the functioning secretary with what we noted in uh in our report with Medicaid funding\nIt is really important not only to to have a group of scientists engaged on a voluntary basis as this this board was but also to have a secretary of that enables the day to day operations and functioning a and a with a dedicated a\nFunding stream that enables than the scientists to reach through their networks and a mobilize more scientific work a more research more engagement both in terms of science but also in terms of the terms of public public\nGauge Maria even know about is associate professor of conflict resolution human security and global governance UMass Boston\nSusan ... is president America of Woods Hole

NPR station [noise]\nThis is living lab radio I'm Heather Goldstone the UN's most recent special report on climate science was eye opening for many but for the for a million or so people who live in the Arctic the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change our daily reality more than a shocking headlines\nThe Arctic is warming at least twice as fast as the rest of the globe\nWeather and seasons that have provided the rhythm of life for generations are shifting sea ice is melting and exposing new expanses of ocean and previously frozen ground is falling and becoming unstable and the changes in the Arctic are wreaking havoc on the climate system in ways that affect all of us\nThese are the topic of the second season of the pod cast threshold executive producer Amy Martin spend Eighteen months traveling around the Arctic reporting the stories of the people who live there and the scientists trying to understand Arctic change Amy welcome to the show thank you for having me\nSo in the first season of thresholds you took on a distinctly a local maybe regional environmental issue and that's the American vice and what made you want to do something as remote as the Arctic for your second season\nThe Arctic is just fascinating to me personally it has been for a long time and um I think as I was you know learning more about climate change just as a as an interested citizen and as a journalist\nThe Arctic just keeps coming up and coming up and coming up and I kind of it was a little bit like the the blind person trying to trying to describe the elephant where I just felt like I kept seeing\nYou know one piece over here another peace over there and I just really wanted to try to stitch it together and understand [noise]\nUm the whole picture as best I could for my own curiosity and because I it because it's such an important area\nAnd then I also felt like I was noticing that most of the stories I was reading um you know focused on scientists and for for a very good reason and we we have a lot of scientists and the season the show as well\nBut it was really noticing a lack of input from people who live in the Arctic and so now that was kind of my second motivation was to really understand this area through the eyes of the people who live there\nSo you traveled to all eight countries\nU.S Canada Russia there's another five [laughter]\nYeah um let's see Iceland Norway Sweden Finland um who am I forgetting to Canada yet\n[laughter] oh Greenland Greenland Greenland source and four million people live in the Arctic I mean not that was really surprising to me yeah you\nKnow it's interesting um they're kind of a popular conception of the Arctic as a I mean the word that comes up over and over and literature is you know that they're in wasteland and um you know that that's not the reality there have been people living in the Arctic for a very very very long time and um [noise]\nYeah there's lots of vibrant cultures and you know interesting things happening up there I'm human made things I mean I went to art galleries and shopping malls I'm ah in Russia I went to the largest city in the Arctic I'm more months can you know it's just it's it's a big city a three hundred thousand people and\nUm you know took the took the bus and did everything that you would do in a in a city you know below the Arctic Circle so there there's a lot of mess busting to do around the Arctic and that's part of the fun of the season as well\nSome of the people are as your kind of alluding to seem very related will and in fact I was struck a you spoke with a kindergarten teacher Kate coke yuck I Believe is is how you say her last name ... ... I'm a resident of a shift from a rough Alaska\nAnd she was talking about how climate change has impacted her home and she sounded like she could be somebody who lives on Cape Cod or many other shorelines a facing the threat of erosion and sea level rise let's let's hear from her every time I think about it I just\nWant to tell people my house now would have been right where the seawall let's have they not moved it yeah and if it wasn't for the seawall probably more would have taken away and\nHad they not move the houses they probably would just fallen and so when you think about it like that then it's like oh my goodness\n[laughter] we don't necessarily think of a sea level rise and erosion being Arctic issues but clearly they must be yeah\nYeah and the big issue in Alaska is actually it's less about sea level rise and more about loss of sea ice because um this tiny little barrier island in northwest Alaska a has has been protected in the winter from the\nThat come down and kick up a huge you know amount of wind and waves they've been protected by that historically because I'm the sea ice forms around them and it almost kind of provides like a insulation or a buffer and so the waves would break you know a mile or two away from the island\nBut now because the sea ice is forming so much later and it's dinner and weaker\nAnd it melts away sooner that means all of these storms are just slamming directly into this island and it's just eating away at the island at the same time it's a permit for us the frozen soil is dying and so that makes us so much more vulnerable um you know to being washed away when those waves hit so it's a\nIt's a one two punch there and and the this island is is tiny and so um you know people in this case what keeps talking about if they had a storm in two thousand five where they actually had to like physically pick up her house and move it closer to the center of the island 'cause it would have just been washed away\nAmy as that story points out clearly the changes relating to a climate disruption are happening in the Arctic right now as you were traveling around doing the reporting for this season of threshold\nWhat were some of the most dramatic changes that you saw well honestly ... was was up\nThere um you know to to visit a place where there are six hundred people who are just an innocent having to like move closer and closer and closer together you know as the years passed as the as the waves come in at it you can really feel um the change and\nUm you know that that was that was really intense um I also you know in northern Scandinavia Norway or nor in Sweden in particular is where I spent the most time in the the northern parts of those countries um\nThat everyone is talking about how just everything's different um they used to get these\nUm you know deep colds early in the season and have you know a lot of of I'm kind of sugary late sort of snow that comes when it's really cold will now they're getting a lot of rain and heavy wet kind of cement like snow\nAnd what that does is um you know there are there are a lot of 'em so many people who live in a far north as are indigenous the indigenous people of northern Scandinavia in western Russia\nUm it does not ... you know the rate which is changing right now as has everything to do with us in our carbon emissions but my point is\nYou know the earth is going to be okay in the long run 'em but what's really up for grabs is human civilization and and the way that we get our food the way that we get our water the way where we live\nHow we are able to take care of ourselves and I'm sort of the peace and stability of our society's um and I think that if people there's a way that this conversation I think often gets framed only in terms of very technical scientific concepts\nThey're standing but what the impact that they have on us has to do with you know whether or not our children are going to be safe and healthy and I think if we can shift the conversation to those very reliable human questions it might help us wrap our heads around how important this isn't how crucial it is\nThat we get real about what's going on and start using our meant human creativity to try to solve this problem\nAmy Martin of the podcast threshold she spent Eighteen months reporting on climate change in the Arctic and that is the subject of the second season of the threshold pod cast Erin right now any thanks for sharing your reporting with us thank you so much for having me [noise]\nUp next the promise of treating

Goldstone rural Americans now site the opioid it\nJobs and the economy is the most pressing problems facing their communities that's according to an NPR poll released this past week and you know a special brings viewers face to face with that reality\nStorm over one of the most dangerous jobs in the world\nMost of the old timers to working moms work with\nPeople used to know more people to the\nIt just it ruin\nThat Jason Edwards speaking in nova his new special called addiction that film explores the biology and chemistry of addiction as well as promising new discoveries and trends in treatment\nSarah hold his writer producer and director of the new nova special addiction Dr Laura ... is medical director of the substance use disorder bridge clinic ending attending physician on the inpatient addiction console team at Massachusetts General hospital\nShe's also assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school welcome to both of you thank you for having me thank you\nSara in deciding to to do this special film these stories and this issue are very much on the minds of Americans across the country across you know all sorts of different spectrum why make a documentary about this issue now\nBecause I felt like I looked at so many documentaries on the subject and almost everyone and then was dying of an overdose they really focused on the tragedy they were very powerful they were making people aware of the crisis\nBut I haven't seen a documentary in quite a while that really tried to explain the science of addiction how does it bring change when it's chronically exposed to drugs why decide to say it's a brain disorder and not a moral failing what can science tell us about what's the most effective treatment\nAnd I hope the film could help educate the public about addiction and really help them have compassion for people struggling with it and offer solutions\nSo what were some of the the things that you found in your reporting that were knew that that kind of advanced the story as you said in in perhaps a more optimistic or more hopeful direction\nPerhaps one of the most important things I realized is that when it when it comes to opioid addiction they're incredibly effective medications now that can help patients deal with with crawl with clay genes and have the stigma against them is huge um I Would talk to like a ...\nHated assisted treatment for four years had finished his PHD was on the job market the he'd be too afraid to give me an interview because even though he was successfully in recovery he felt like the people would hold that against him that he ... he was being treated for addiction\nDid you in your reporting gain any insight into where that stigma and where the controversy over medically assisted treatment comes from well\nI mean first of all I think one of the big reasons for stigma an addiction is it it's a baffling illness it's baffling force um patients end up engaging in very destructive behavior it's very hard for the people around them to understand so it kinda contributes to this idea that addiction is a moral failing which isn't [noise]\nUm and then I think for years you know one of the only treatments available was the twelve step approach of Alcoholics Anonymous\nAnd they really shunned the use of any drugs and\nThe fact now that we have medications that are highly effective oftentimes will say well you're just trading one drug for another and in fact that's not the definition of addiction addiction is compulsively consuming a dry despite negative consequences and when people take drugs to help them you know\nTreat their addiction they're actually able to get up and go to work they're able to uh we engage with their families their communities hold down jobs go back to school they're no longer you know [noise]\nTen you know technically labeled as having the disease of addiction they're not engaging and destructive behavior and yet very few people can go to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and say I'm On medication assisted treatment\nSo there's a there's a stigma from from both ends Laura as medical director of energy ages bridge clinic how are you treating patients who come in with an addiction problem and wanting help\nSo at the bridge clinic our mission is really immediate access is very low barrier care and it'd be a welcoming people at any stage of their illness so kind of coming as they are in starting you know where the patient feels that they can start really meeting them where they are and then helping to move them along and you know when we\nAbout addiction treatment this is thought to be a really innovative approach\nBut I I'm an internist in a primary care physician and when we look at um the treatment that we offer for every other chronic relapsing illness that we treat in medicine this is completely analogous to that so we're just looking at substance use disorders through the ...\nAnd the dirty little secret is that it works and it's critically important as Sarah said I'm\nJust start people immediately on life saving medications but also to getting back to a meeting people where they are if people say I don't I'm not ready to do medication right now I'm or I'm not ready to um you know see you regularly but I'm kind of\nTipping my toe into this I'm thinking about it um this illness is really underscored by ambivalence I'm as well as stigma and so working with people where they think they can start and sticking with them\nI'm understanding that it's not a quick exit off the highway but it's it's often or circuitous routes um and so sticking with people working to reduce the negative consequences of their ongoing drug use\n'em and you know first and foremost going back to the basics of human compassion and connection\nUm and understanding that this is an illness of deep isolation and shame because of stigma deep rooted stigma\nAnd we do a lot of working with people to try to undo that and reclaim the trust that the medical community has really lost with a lot of people with addiction because of our highly structured models that really don't meet the natural history of this illness\nYou know we've been talking about this controversy and and even the stigma attached to medically assisted treatment for addiction can you just walk us through", "show_name": "The Point",
