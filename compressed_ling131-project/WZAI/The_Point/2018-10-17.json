Jonathan Schwartz and psychiatrist mark ... good morning gentlemen morning I said this is interesting because\nI talk about this but I never I recently I just only heard about this term Michael aggressions and it was actually termed back in Nineteen Seventy mark tell us the history of this and it was really um tell us what it is an when it was first coined\nA there was a psychiatrist Chester pierce I Believe he's deceased at this point uh\nI'm uh from Harvard or had he was a black himself and he described the minor vote a quote unquote a a minor or insults that black people endure in daily life\nMinor put downs that are\nNot necessarily intentional on the part of the person a speed\nDating a bus or experienced as I'm not as good as you I'm not all I'm entitled to be to have the uh benefits that your group has namely the white society uh I don't measure up I Can't succeed\nI'm uh all of the um [noise] uh the negative\nAspects of a black identity or get communicated 'em by two others or to to blacks in a rather unintentional why are they one of the um\n[noise] uh uh you're clear examples of it and ah illustrates how unconscious Israeli a is a is a white woman walking down the street I'm too black males approach her and she grabs onto her pocketbook holding it tighter\nI'm behaving automatically are like these black men are a threat uh so I'm\nA [noise] the black experience obviously is I'm a I must be a ... to be avoided a I'm a threatening to others I'm not going to be accepted I Can't get close I Can't get 'em\nI Can't get a invested in involved\nOr so a doctor appears noticed this I'm sure we experienced it many times himself\nI'm a big professional in a in a white profession\nI'm so I'm a and he described it uh and um it didn't it it got some research and some notice them because this was a time of the civil rights or the height of the civil rights are actually a and I'm a it didn't\nProtection at everything the numbers they just sit there in fact I'm I'm happy that they make you know claim one way or another on that but sometimes that is the best with if he's if you look at something or you may find something based on your theoretical or a perspective that another research mendota found\nAbout you know I Would ask the question of whether it's even possible for any of us for anyone to be free of implicit bias now now at least you know when I was um [noise] you know in training we we were taught that\nTo bring our own biases was very very important part of becoming a competent therapist because after all we all would have by biases at the same time it was interesting I I Will remember that one of my mentors or in in group supervision in my training uh he played a game with us [noise]\nAnd and this is how it went so he he would give us one fact about a patient who was going to be assessed the name person's name okay so now how how uh how would you create a differential diagnosis in other words a list of the most likely or possible diagnoses just based on the person's name\nSo for example if the person had to tell you name you know maybe certain things would come to\n'em and then he would give you one more fact like the person's address so based upon what town they lived in\nNewton versus east Boston by how would that narrow it down and he would add one fact at a time and that we as a group would talk about what that information meant to us in terms of a differential diagnosis either making certain\nProblems less likely or more likely very very interesting yeah of course that's nothing more than a whole series of what one might call micro aggressions yeah that's what I heard you know so I you know I have to admit that it I mean at least one person sitting in this room who is very skeptical\nOf how this whole phenomena and is understood\nYou well yeah and that's the whole point is and we've just really recently started to really look at this I mean it's scientifically right\nSure yeah well what you just the process of that game that you just uh just described a really is a a a description of how the brain works\nOr you get a couple of facts and you feel in a lot of ... based on facts are and that's how the brain works and perceiving uh that that's a glass of water and this is a death chair or a few facts and mainly the brain is interpreting um this is about actually\n[laughter] anything by hand or an advocate anyone\nClass say a name how can I can only thing from a name or did you all just\nWell that that would only be inviting criticism [laughter] I think probably I it's hard for me to remember that far back but I I think most of us would have kept quiet at that one\nEight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number that's eight six six and nine nine nine four sixty six

tending to Vegas and that next time on the take away today at noon here on WBAI [noise]\n[noise] you're listening to the point we're talking about the psychology of micro aggressions with psychologist Michael Ozzie and psychiatrists Jonathan Schwartz and mark ... eight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number if you'd like to join the conversation this morning eight six six nine nine nine for six to six or email address is the point\nAt Cape and islands is a Cape and islands dot org\nI'm so I'm thinking about ... one of the reasons also I wanted to talk about this this morning and next month we're going to do a more in depth program on the Asian experience here on very white Cape Cod but we have to um uh Asian reporters and they've had very interesting experiences and\nAnd ... and it's it's it's really I think open our eyes and the conversations we've had here at the station of sometimes some of this conversation that seems like a micro aggressions that maybe isn't intentional but\nWhen you look at their experience you can understand how it makes them feel bad I'm and I'm thinking of you know we talked about one example being a somebody says to an Asian American you speak grade English I wouldn't think of and you know but\nYou know it and it may not be you intend that but when they hear that all the time it makes them think wow or you know the they get confused a lot of people confuse them they look nothing alike\nKnow it really raises a lot of questions for them when they're in this you know\nSee that's that's a complex those tools than yes or very illustrative but also very complex\nYou know mark and I've talked before about how the brain works and how we're hardwired to pick up on normally is and how we feel in the blanks and things like that so it's easy for me to conceptualize a someone\nWho can confused to people from a different culture simply because they haven't even bother to slow their mind down enough to think about about fact which was the epitome of an accidental Michael aggression mindless\nYou'd have to really counter intuitively work against the way your brand is normally work it's doing what it's supposed to do but in this case and that\nIs true that if you're a person that if you have running the jeopardy feeling failing it yeah yeah I don't want\nThat fully a product and fast thinking and ... yeah uh it's automatic it's like you learn to ride a bike it's automatic not conscious that ah and um that's the brain for first that on the brain prefers\nA delegating task to the unconscious as opposed to utilizing I'm a resources that the conscious mind requires and and the brain is organized for that though\nUm organized in a um a hierarchy of of how information is processed a and I'm\nSo this is from the lower levels of the hierarchy or where it doesn't get to the awareness level that's what's good about this concept is at least it it it's a it's a word that brings forward I'm a\nA phenomenon that we can pay attention to the fridge awareness yeah we're in is a guy like oh and\nThen the thing is you know you say something unintentionally that that hurt them if you make them feel bad ... well you know and then you the ... especially think when it's racial or gender differences and you go okay well what do I think ... do you like you don't want to see anything whether you're afraid you're going to say something again that's going to be upsetting ...\nYears ago I think the last time around Jonathan mentioned something like this about going back you know to an earlier time and it was safe to have our kids go out and play and stuff and not so and market commented that are not everything's great and earlier time but some things were so back in an earlier time\nThe Trump we would use impolite or that was an ... kind of said in the ... sorry just make an apology those could be done now Im polite seem to have more of the past Twenty years into politically correct and you just trying to be polite just trying to avoid offending someone accidents\nCorrect when you try to demonstrate some kind of manners and the modern day manners are coming out and insulting someone to their face to the third generation of their family you know so it really cultural change has\nHappened a very quickly more quickly than our brain is able to keep up with an really requires a whole lot of\nCognitive tap dancing and awareness and counterintuitive kind of information processing\nWhich and my point and I do have one that um people when they get older you know in the fifties sixties seventies eighties they don't do the kind of quick processing is very burdensome to them they're capable medication but it's\nVery very frustrating for them to always be accused of being politically correct or implied Michael aggressive when they don't mean any of that\nI just really hard for them to keep up on those changes less apt to Allison who's giving us a call from east Pam Hi Alison\nHi there how are you a great thanks for taking my call where um I\nI sort of came into this conversation I just got into my car little while ago so I came up with a little late but you were talking about implicit bias and I just finished a master's degree and if you guys have already spoken about this I Apologize\nBut in in one of the courses we had to\nDo it there's an ongoing study um I Believe at Harvard University and I'm not in my office so I Can't give you the link\nBut it's a it's an ongoing study that they take your data once you take it ... yeah but but uh teaches you about your own bias mhm um and and I had to do it for this question just how amazing it was that how unaware of the bias I had a ... I could sit at my self\nFound the they're all over the place and people don't realize that\nMaybe you you raise the question also of other ways in which micro aggressions occur other than matters of race or gender\nYou know it's been well established that people for example who are very overweight or much less likely to get a job and following a series of interviews than somebody who is of normal weight it's also been well established that people who are tall\nAre generally listening to more are more likely to be given a job or promotion than people who were short ... is so these are I'm aging and these are ... what's that age to Asia ... yeah um yeah his doctor Wally in our particular sensitive to that [laughter]\nBut uh so so these are in a way facts of our life\nI'm ... and and uh areas in which micro aggressions a A R a rapid\nYeah Stephen is giving us a call from Chatham Hi Stephen\nHi uh yes I was just going to comment on something that your guests were just talking about whether it was the intent of someone to commit a micro aggression and\nIt seems to me that where it's being in a perfect way of expressing ourselves\nWell take something we say and it can be ambiguity comes into it so that\nIf someone a interprets what we say it takes a certain way and we and then they say that we have hurt their feelings or they feel some slight we can say oh well I didn't mean it that way I meant it this way and if it's a reasonable\nWay of saying something and say well that was not my intent than the person all the power should not be in the hands of the receiver it should be on the personal this is what I was trying to convey benefits reasonable and if there's a pattern of this then\nPerson should be given the benefit of the doubt yeah\nYeah so that's one of the two good points one of the ... conundrums of trying to do the research [noise] certainly any reasonable person would would presume that you know to uh to make amends to apologize though the started was my intention\nI was actually trying to be inclusive I didn't mean to be you know ... to that but there are some people who I think as a recent history has shown will refuse to believe that you know\nYou're pointing out something that the ... the power doesn't have to be in one person's side or another it can be negotiated a and that's the point of recognizing this dynamic that I'm a person a admitting\nThe what what's labeled as micro aggressions I'm a has the power initially but the person who responds or has the power and they can negotiate a what is meant and get down a I have an open discussion rather than um\nA ... year over sensitive you know a labeling a contest\nAnd I think to follow but she even had said I think the the proof of that intention analogy is in the fall of ... behavior much in the language oh no I didn't really mean to say that you're like fat stupid sorry about that in mind that\nThe person kind of behavior which would indicate the intention analogy because actions speak louder than words so if you're in infringed situations you know you say the wrong thing you'd they've you quickly negotiate that you know back to what it should be\nBut with strangers you really have to look at the behavior and a lotta times you don't get to hang around the person long enough to actually look and behavior usher so it's a lot of um hard feelings can occur by accident\nI remember about Fifteen Years ago I walked into a coffee shop and do Bedford the same coffee shop I was in the habit of of you know going into every morning and there was another fellow there who who else\nWell whether he was African American or a story and honestly I don't know if you remember but I I Do know that he had been a professor at U. mass Dartmouth an English professor thanks\nAnd you know we've seen each other I didn't know him it wasn't even sure of his name but uh when he walked in and I was standing there at the counter I said to morning chief\nAnd he blew up in my face I mean\nAnd and uh I Can't remember the details of the conversation but he made it clear to me that he considered that a ... ... and uh that I that he wasn't going to tolerate that sort of a comment from me\nAnd I still remember my memories are great but I still remember the Fifteen Years later because I was really shaken up the idea that I somehow had\nPut him down yeah now with ... and regionally you obviously much more much more than that or even a micro aggression you must have experience as a huge yeah and so I mean I thought it was kind of a compliment way that you know he was a professor in the way reference to the fact that he was on top of the world that he was so nervous and yeah\nEight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number that's eight six six nine nine

islands dot org [noise]\nSo what what do we know about the impact on those who feel um fight it by the micro aggressions if they're ... what the\nOther ... this is another area of a controversy in research um the uh what we do know from what research does exist is\nThat it is associated microbe receiving a lot of micro aggressions is associated with poor outcomes in terms of a health wellbeing self esteem and even some mental disorder you mean like depression or or you know ... you know\nAh that that it's um [noise]\nUh that the person or experiences as a as a a real put down and that becomes their definition or the her identity I'm a in a uh in life a soldier center\nIf we were speaking during one of the brakes about a childhood in childhood formation and this is a key indicator too many put downs are a lot of put downs ... kids\nAnd kids every kid has experienced that in their home with their brothers sisters on cycles cousins parents\nIt really does start to set the stage for how they look at themselves you don't have to be a a child senseless enough to create really miserable human being on the other takes us some repeated like the Chinese water torture\nA negative comments micro aggressions if you will and any trials of will grow up with a very bad self esteem and it doesn't take long to do it\nRight and the um a controversy or the contract contravene

poor outcomes in life are so there's ... it's not just a simple thing that micro aggressions or less let's eliminate them and then everybody is going to be a rise to a high level um [noise] it's not

upload during the debate we'd like to take a minute to give Charlie Baker and Jay Gonzales a hand right now please do [noise]\nGot to start with you it's not just rush hour at anymore everybody stuck in traffic all the time now two years ago northeastern did a study\nThat talked about cars already crawling at ten miles an hour I'm three during the commute and more and more cars coming before you know what we could be the total stance down so have you done enough about this issue considering the fact that the legislature approved this pilot program\nThat we just can't drive a ship commuted outside of rush hour you didn't want it you said now you wanted to study that\nWe had an awful lot of studies how we\nFall I think the biggest thing we need to do and if somebody spend a lot of time and the traffic around the commonwealth I'm more than a little aware of that I think the thing we really need to do is continue to invest in a public transportation system we have an eight billion dollar investment planned over the next five years\nWhich between the red line the orange line in the green line will increase capacity by about fifty percent during rush hour to makes a huge difference you out of ten thousand trips to the commuter rail over the course of the past four years\nIt can continue to build on that success and build capacity there were finally using designated bus lanes which people have talked about for years but we finally got some up and running in a whole bunch of the pipeline\nAnd I think in many respects on the public transportation side we simply need to do more to get people more options with respect to the road and bridge piece um\nWe're planning to spend another ... billion on our roads or bridges and many of those investments are going to be geared to areas that I refer to his choke points and uh and those choke points in many cases create a big piece of the issue especially around greater Boston\nAnd we're also going with the expansion plans I mean we're basically going to build the Greenland extension in the summer though which covers one of the most congested court or is on the eastern seaboard\nAnd rather than waiting until twenty thirty to finally get around to doing something with respect to south coast rail we've redesigned the route we should have it finish operating twenty twenty five\nChickens are usually the government's done enough and if not two or three specific things you could mention you think\nBe doing now I don't and this is the issue I hear the most about everywhere I go on the campaign trail we have one of the worst transportation systems in the country as you mentioned people in our state or sitting in traffic logging in pretty much any other state people can't depend on our public transit system to get to\nAnd deal with it or I'm going to ask the wealthy to pay three billion dollars an additional revenue to invest in our education and transportation system we have to be honest with voters that we need to invest more to get our transportation systems where it needs to be we should try innovative things like the pilot program you mentioned the to discount\nPulls during non peak hours or and I supported that\nBut we need our public transit system to be one that people can depend on so they want to get off the roads and use it and we need to invest more in it to get to that place\nGovernor you want to say on a movie I don't disagree with them with respect to the fact that we need to invest more in our investments over the next five years between the roads and bridges and the public transportation stuff is about eight billion more than we invested in the last five years of the previous administration yes we definitely need to invest more and we have a plan to do that\nJob and get back to where you sort of go drink comes off as a real need to be honest with voters and your thing also voters about the three billion dollars a billion loss\nIs a tax on college endowments and expansion something Donald Trump to even senators marketing and Warren said would hurt students you're two billion dollars additional\nEven cleared every single hurdle wouldn't raise one nickel until your second term in office do you have a real plan that would raise real money in the short term to do the things you say he was known\nIt's a very specific plan to raise three billion dollars each year by the end of my first term which is three million more than zero which is his plan\nAnd you know\nWe're spending more now on the ... on on the team thanks to some decisions that Deval Patrick made to raise the gas tax and some others but it is not nearly enough\nOr the people across\nThe state who use the tea can't depend on it affects their quality of life every single day governor bakers plan is that it's going to be fixed in Fifteen Years and he hasn't even said how he's going to pay for that it's unacceptable\nJob I Need not coverage and see around the desert even one democratic leader in the legislature support your endowment yeah Jamie I'll drink supports ... I'm Talking about people who are nobody\nHas not supported it and if I get elected running on this\nOr that is going to be a mandate to do it and and you know what\nWe need public leaders that aren't going to do the same old stuff the same old Republican playbook of no new taxes at any cost and we're just going to have to get by with whatever we have it's not good enough we're not serving the people we've got one of the worst systems in the country is affecting people's quality of life and it's going to start dragging our economy\nJust one of us go over well first of all um\nTax on college endowments to spectacularly bad idea and yes it would come primarily from students and their families because it's fun to a big piece of scholarship and locally and a student said money but the other thing I Would say here is um [noise] the issues with respect to public transportation go back a long long time\nUm the investments that we've started at first the first time the tea ever spent a billion dollars on his capital budget was this past year\nI mean they left one point five billion dollars on the table that they're living in the previous administration if they couldn't even figure out how to get out the door and\nI took the position early on we were going to create a physical and management control board and try and make up for twenty year lack of investment in what I call the core system the system than losing a million people a day\nAnd those investments and signals and switches in power systems in electronics and boring stuff like railroad ties and tracks and third rail\nThose are the things that are going to give you additional capacity and reliable system I quickly if you ... your\nStatus close stuff and we have to invest there's no rational person who understands that these budget who doesn't think we need more revenue\nGovernor bankers very on a commission that he put together when he became governor said reform isn't enough we need to raise taxes to invest more\nI Am I Am saying there's going to be a clear choice I'm and asked the wealthy to pay more in taxes so that we can make these investments are going to make a difference for working families across the state who cannot depend on this system to get to work on time and we have to do it I'm not running for governor to manage around the status quo but we're not good enough\nTo stay on tax just for a second governor find described to you governor whom posed a quarter billion dollar assessment employers to fund Medicaid and signed a bill with an eight hundred million dollar payroll tax to pay for family and medical leave what'd you say that person was in no new taxes governor\nNo I'd say here's why the way and so it's fair to say you have raised taxes significantly and you will raise taxes when you think it's appropriate is not affairs terrorists nation of your first four years\nFirst of all with respect to the grand bargain which is the issue associated with creating a pay family and medical leave program here in Massachusetts\nThat's a good example of a negotiated arrangements that took a couple of our questions off the ballot and made it possible for the commonwealth to move forward on what I call a a deal that people could live with and I find it because I thought it was a lot better um than the ballot question\nA program that was going to be fun to the same way we find workers' comp the same way we find unemployment insurance and I think those programs a stand on their own and they're funded on their own is it only ... million dollar tax increase it's an eight hundred million dollar increase to support that new benefit yeah but we inherited a big deficit\nEverybody's told us we're going to have to raise taxes to pay for it we didn't and instead we worked hard we balance the budget we came up with smarter ways to deliver services made big investments in all kinds of agencies and local services and now we have a big surplus and we just finished depositing\nBeing the case and then once you've finished developing the case which is what happened here the colonel gave that information in the U.S attorney and gave it to the attorney general\nAs she should have in the process associated with the records I mean\nI don't know about you but when I think about in ten if somebody's actually tried industry records if they think are relevant to a case they're not going to use the traditional process at some place with\nAll kinds of different independent entities with their eyes on it as part of that review you think it was totally innocent and I don't just are not if I think it was a mistake but I don't think it was an intensive destroy relevant record\nThe facts don't support that of course it was intentional two days after the the media report that you mentioned and it's an attempt to cover up\nSomebody should be going after the people who who set these records to be destroyed this is a hundred and sixty boxes of personnel and payroll and attendance records and you said that the colonel didn't know\nThat this was going on I mean I have absolutely no confidence that you and your leadership team have a handle on what's going on to state police so when you would do is is is fire to colonel and went out and I\nYou know these cover up incidents happened over there the last one a month ago I mean the governor should be all over this I ... we should not only replace the kernel of someone from the outside\nIt still has the credibility and doesn't come from this called rat the legislature I actually have to hire and we asked the legislature to pass a law to allow me to do it because we need someone with credibility from the outside who doesn't come from this culture of corruption\nWho in a very transparent way it's going to get a handle on exactly what's going on over there and fix it because right now nobody should have any confidence at the Baker administration and the governor have a handle on it and are dressing you\nYou recall of corruption in state police couldn't disagree more with that look\nThe colonel is the one who did the investigation that led to every single indictments in every single player that's happened since this whole thing began she's the one with her team\nWho follow this string develop the cases and submitted him to the appropriate authorities for criminal prosecution she's the one that brought in and outside financial services firm to do a top to bottom review of the organization she's the one that brought and Kathy O'Toole may very well respected\nManager and later in the law enforcement community service a consultant to the agency and she's the one who implemented the standard with respect to doing a quarterly reviews associated with overtime and she's the one that blew up tripping which is where the vast majority of the problems were Fifteen seconds trillions\nWell I'm six months ago that haven't happened yet she's the one who before where the state I Believe are weaker and was responsible for auditing or these overtime abuses and saw red flags and didn't proceed and and she's the one that all these cover up the tents happened under certain element of surprise check on certainly with the\nCulture of corruption of troop ... and that's why I got abolished but the pain of brush across two thousand men and women who every single day serve the commonwealth and serve the people in Massachusetts and support gang units in fugitive units and do a lot of the really important ground law enforcement work that needs to be done here in the commonwealth I think it's unfair it's\nMoved education gather you've spoken offer the forefront of the highest in the nation test scores of funding goals and met a recent report cold a number one for some\nHighlights and I'm sure you've seen a dramatic racial and income disparities one that stuck out for me\nIs Massachusetts ranked second nationally in eighth grade reading for all students\nLatino eighth graders ranked second from the bottom or in reading these kinds of numbers in there many like that haven't changed much at all in your four years one why and to do not failed those kids in these past four years\nI think we have a lot of work left to do in education and\nUm we've made progress in many cases about a half the kids to start as English language learning students um get to the point where they're proficient enough in a in English both reading and writing it that they're no longer yellow students and those kids graduate at just about the same rate as traditional students do\nAnd that's what I said I Do I mean these kids I'm just talking about the safety record Latino goods that generation is going to be lost and then the next one is the pace knowing face a adequate\nNo I think with a couple of things I think we need to do one is we need to set up coloration academies and we need to help pay for those\nAnd put those is a proven to be successful voices in Massachusetts in other parts around the country and use them as a device to helping hands kids who aren't making it and are getting it done and they should probably start earlier then they'll go with respect to those we also want to use after school programming\nA as a mechanism to create enrichment opportunities for kids in those districts and we also want to be really aggressive about professional development one of the programs I think has turned out to be quite successful is the empowerment zone that they set up in Springfield\nWhich I tried to convince the legislature to do more out so far without success\nBut that's a model that the teachers like the administrators like and they're showing real progress in helping a lot of those kids improve their scores\nWhat do you do about those racial disparities reasons\nResponsibility we have collectively through government is to ensure that every single child has access to great public education\nAnd we're falling down on that job and governor bakers been governor for four years now and made no progress on the fact that we have some of the biggest achievement gaps in the country and the funding disparities for public schools are growing even bigger so two things that are big priorities in mind that will address this one\nMaking sure a childcare and preschool is affordable and accessible to every family and child it has proven to be game changing particularly for lower income kids in terms of their success in school and in life afterwards\nAnd we need to fully fund our public schools\nBoth of those things are going to cost money I have a plan to fund them to raise three billion dollars from the wealthy to invest in education and transportation and again the governor's plan is zero continues with the same old stuff\nInflationary increases in education funding while we're uh we're under funding a lot of the lower income school districts in this state and we're letting way too many kids\nHolding my kind of our government losing a generation one of the toxins again half apparently corn approval legislature and blown out of ... still four years roll to challenge do four years off and the other tax has very limited support so the reality is the money's not really there for the ... I'm going to challenge\nBoth of those children uh if if the if the millionaires tax has initiated through the legislature then the legal issue goes away it was because it was a citizens petition so that would be for years it would raise two billion dollars\nThat's not soon enough that's not what the legislatures already voted for it both times and it's very popular so I I have confidence that will happen the ... the ... tax which would raise a billion dollars now to get us started\nUm while not popular from people who were mentioned before who worked for Harvard and some of the universities forty surrounding Warren got on a more huge enthusiastic response from it\nBecause people understand we need to be investing in our education system in transportation system and the status quo is not working for too many it's I I Will not let them down\nYou know we were just talking about disparities between port Townsend wealthy towns and a great example is is ... and where they can afford to spend a dollar twenty eight cents on on classify versus a west and where they could spend two hundred and Seventy five dollars a per kid\nThe Democratic legislature failed to overhaul school funding which hasn't been an overhaul for years that was a democratic legislature talking about the legislature doing things they couldn't even do that\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nFunding formula and provide new money to invest in education and I will be a governor who does because we have to\nWe can't afford to continue with the same old stuff um and I do have a specific plan and Jim I Know it's controversial among some but it's a plan and Charlie bakers plan is zero zero is not going to cut it\nSo I just got short respond to that so his plan raises a billion dollars now if he gets a path and two billion dollars if you get to the next these past four years from now [noise]\nEarly childhood I'd everybody ... billion dollars\nHis plans associated with public transportation costs many billions multiple billions your education plan he's talking about is at least two billion a year and counting on top of that and some of the other stuff he's talked about a\nHuge money as well the notion that he has put enough plans on the table to find all the stuff he's promising and committing to\nSimply isn't true and that's not really go running or leadership that's politics and in addition to that we have put\nThe status quo administration as he calls us has put a hundred and ten million and new money into preschool and we did that because we believe it's important to find that\nWhen he was the INS secretary he cut it by eighty five million dollars while he was raising state spending by six point five billion ... not only the rhetoric the others ...\nNumbers that he's throwing out or not true you ... you didn't cut presiding cutting preschool yeah I was managing during the worst fiscal crisis the state it ever faced ... that's not true hunting cutting point five billion dollar increase in state spending on my ... not while I was going to secretary they enough that's not true we had to cut funding\nAnd a versus the pre recession budget but here's the thing I'm governor\nSeems to be satisfied with where he is on early education and care when I was managing the state budget we were twentieth and the country in terms of the amount we spent per child for pre K. we're now we've now fallen under governor Baker to thirty seven\nRespond to that or I wanted to have another healthcaregov euro evidence about everything he just said with respect to single payer and the best evidence and the best example we have of a state that really took it all the way which is not that big and not that complicated is Vermont and even they couldn't figure out how to get there 'cause they couldn't even figure out how to get to a plan\nAnd when you talk about something that's literally a thirty billion dollar\nExpansion in government spending here in the commonwealth of mess um which is what it's been determined to be by several folks have studied uh uh that's just a profound change in literally everything and most people in Massachusetts\nAh various issues associated with the healthcare system they think the health care that they get and the care that's delivered here is appropriately among the very best you're going to find any what our way of turning the whole system upside down I'm\nFor that I just don't understand we have issues with respect to prescription drugs yeah and we should go after that and go after at heart and we went after last year um unfortunately we weren't able to get a proposed and we made approved by the feds but that's something we should go back to the legislature and back to go to another proposal that will kind of effect\nOf both false than access and we'll get back to ... weeks ago the largest hospital merger thinking rough for Twenty years and master's is cleared another hurdle critics claim that emerged Beth Israel and health will increase costs and reduce access to share their concerns were already on the merger\nWould spend a ton of time with um [noise]\nThe public health council and the attorney general's office and the health policy commission working through these issues and the set of conditions of public health council\nPut on this particular merger with specter cost and access and\nUm and performance generally with respect to serving underserved populations I think everybody agrees are the most stringent and far reaching ever a that's been put on a merger and Massachusetts ... I Do support it at this point if those conditions are actually met and they're pretty consistent with what the attorney general's been talking about as well\nYou are going to those words were I don't in the system we have a because it will give them I Do a market power\nAnd it will end up increasing costs but if we go to a single payer system\nI'm less concerned so get the benefits of consolidation being able to offer a coordinated care for people without having the market leverage 'cause there's just one pair we need to get rid of health insurance companies there is a ... I was very proud of what a lot of ... my company did to connect our members to the care they need it\nBut most of what we did was facilitate a bunch a useless transactions that's what every health insurance company does there's times that cost\nThat we need to get out of the system and this is a this is another example of a big difference between the governor myself\nOr what I hear him saying is why would we take this on it's too hard\nOr this is the status quo is you know where we need to be let's make incremental change\nThe system is not working for people it is way too expensive they aren't getting access to the care they need and to me that's not acceptable and this is a way to improve the system to simplify save money overall this won't costs thirty billion dollars more this will save money overall\nAnd people will have access to the health care services\nSomething that is so fundamental to the way people think about their lives and live their lives and I got to tell you um when my opponent was the chair of the health connector which at that point in time was supposed to be teeing up in implementing the Affordable CARE Act and was serving three hundred thousand people here in the commonwealth of Massachusetts\nThat thing cratered and it's they created for two years and yet people who literally we're on the way to hospitals to have babies who didn't know if that health insurance people who had medications and prescriptions that they didn't know if they could get filled and they'd show up at the pharmacy and it turned out they didn't have coverage and in the end\nWe fixed it after we took office after literally two years of chaos for three hundred four hundred thousand people here in the camel up the mess and I just don't think when you're talking about health care you should be talking about it in such a flip the way this is wildly mental and he was in another ... onto\nThat this is not flipping and of course every everyone in the Patrick ... who was involved with the health connector uh\nWas concerned about the impact it had on people I left the health connector a year before the implementation of this so you know to blame me for something when I wasn't there a and not take responsibility for things that are happening on your watch it the state police and elsewhere is a problem but here's the thing\nWe can't I'm not going to I'm not going to be satisfied with the healthcare system we have because it's not working for people the number one issue that I get the biggest reaction to when I'm Out on the campaign trail is to say that I'm going to get rid of health insurance companies and go to a single payer system because people don't want to have to accept\nA system that is too complicated for them and where they're paying too much and they can't get access to the care they need\nAnd I'm not being governor to just manage the status quo and and hope to make it a little bit better serve I'm going to provide bold leadership together as to where we need to be to make a real difference for people and it's not being flippant it's called leadership\nSuch tournament running yeah a couple of quick once you're on the ballot questions or a chicken thoughts you support question one the one that would limit the number of patients assigned nurses and Kevin Baker publishes that so let's start with your chance aren't going and why why are you in favor of this\n'cause I lean towards patient safety it's not perfect as governor I work with the legislature to tweak it if we eat to passes but um we're we're being given a false choice here and it's a symptom of our broken healthcare system or we need to lean towards patient safety on this one pocket\nHave a higher nursed a patient ratio in Massachusetts and they have in California which is to say people compare this proposal too\nWould be incredibly aggressive it takes effect fifty five days after it gets passed the penalties are severe the staffing requirements are really prescriptive\nAnd it will put community hospitals nursing homes rehab hospitals and psychiatric service providers at very grave risk and for those reasons I don't supportive okay but also as nine hundred million dollars to the cost of healthcare says\nPeople support the law protecting transgender people from discrimination public accommodations governor you posit untruth a town called the bathroom down you signed him to than sixteen but you did it kind of privately I I'm Wondering if your as soon as she asked about this kind of lukewarm adopt this er what's his story\nUm I supported it and I signed it and I work with the legislature on it to come up with a legislation that everybody could support and it ended up passing on a bipartisan basis which I was proud of um I also support question three I think we should keep it um and I've donated the question\nIs for question through I had was totally do um and the point about a ... signing it in a room by himself why he had to hold a fake bill signing ceremony so the people whose rights are protected by that legislation\nCould celebrate the protection of life I'm going to stand up for every single person in this state I'm going to see everyone here everyone and respect everyone\nAnd operate from the heart on issues like this and no one will ever question where I stand for wasn't a republic ceremony goes on for\nSome of it's just scheduling we we'd have public ceremony sometimes sometimes we don't have press avail right after that I Wish I made very clear I was busy asking about the opportunity I just\nLet me ask you about Amazon and in ... in the state and city kitchen about a hundred and fifty million dollars in infrastructure in tax breaks to get G. E. and new jobs to Boston and seeing how the company has its troubles since then\nSo the question is how far should we go in terms of tax breaks and other incentives to half Amazon H cue to and as promised fifty thousand jobs that you even want\nIt given the fact that I was just talk around here that here is congestion and housing costs that was if they did come here it would just send that through the roof\nWell we've added two hundred thousand jobs store economy over the course of the past four years and have more people working here than in any time in state history um and we also have a fairly big presence from Amazon they have about six or seven thousand people here and they just rented a million square feet\nUm for another two thousand people so Amazon is going to have a presence here sort of no matter what I'm with respect to the um the vast majority of the state\nInvestments in property that we all um that they are currently leasing and I'm In that property or as a state after that it wasn't we didn't write them a check it was a a big tax benefit to them it was in fact settlement investments in property that we own and the seaport district um that they're now occupy\nHow do you feel about this uh we should not have spent a hundred and twenty five million dollars to improve property in the hottest real estate district in our state\nFor one of the wealthiest corporations in the world\nAnd I'm Glad they're here but um we need to be investing in the things that government is supposed to do well\nThat will provide an environment here for business investment and growth things like a great transportation systems and education system that is producing a workforce that is the most talented workforce in the world affordable housing\nUm says we want amazoncom with sick assassin which I'd be like ten miles an hour and nobody can afford an apartment or house anymore feeding me addicted to say game and we ended up like a a Washington state I\nThink about our transportation system our for our housing supply can't support the workforce we have I don't know where fifty thousand people are going to go I'd be shocked if they chose to come here\nAnd we shouldn't be giving taxpayer subsidies the weight of the stuff we need to be investing in fixing the infrastructure that supports business growth there are thousands of businesses right here in Massachusetts who make decisions every day since astronaut they need to depend on their workforce to get to work on time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Point", "city": "Brewster", "day": "17"}
