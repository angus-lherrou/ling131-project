there are approximately one point five million people in the U.S with autism spectrum disorder much of the focus has been on diagnosing and providing services for children with the disorder but as these children become adults finding work that is\nDirty becomes important many individuals on the autism spectrum have difficulty finding a job that matches their skills and interests not only is frustrating for them it denies employers access to a pool of talented skilled and loyal employees\nToday we discuss some of the reasons it's been difficult for neuro diverse individuals to find the right job efforts to change how employers view diversity and what happens when the right match is made between employers in our diverse employees\nJoining us on the phone from her office in New York City is turkey Cunningham she's CEO of specialists turned us a tire welcome to the program\nHi good morning thank you for having the shore so tell us a little bit about specialist running and how it's fun it was founded\nYeah I the founder was a man named is a man named ... who in Denmark had a son that was diagnosed with autism this was in the early to thousands and it was during the time when there was a big question as to whether this was an epidemic\nWhether his son should be chores or should the world changed to meet his needs [noise] he um quickly decided that the world needed to change to meet his son's need he loved his son and he didn't feel that he needed to be short\nAt the same time he was the director at an IT from and as he was doing research about people with autism he found out that they have high quality standards excellent at recall\nUncanny attention to detail they were great ad I'm being motivated to complete to his schedule and he thought wouldn't it be great if my staff was like this\nAnd so he asked his boss if he would be able to use his open positions to try to find autistic people to join his I teach him and his boss said yep go right ahead\nI when he did it was unbelievably successful he realized that the other team members were able to learn from the autistic people and vice versa employee engagement went up\nI the productivity of the full team went up and it wasn't because of the autistic people alone people were doing the jobs that are meaningful to them they were sharing parts that they didn't like with other people who did like them\nAnd try to work all looked at this and said you know what I think I can make a movement out of this I think I can literally changed the world so he left his cushy job and\nThen they do a project with that hiring manager so they're very comfortable they've known a hiring manager for almost a month they've been working with the team for almost a month and the hiring manager has an ability to see how the person\nIs ... with their team as well as their skills and so we get close to a hundred percent retention when our autistic people or play or nerd\n[noise] so so so what do you want adopting universal changes in his interview process to make it more inclusive um for for I mean what are some of the changes to interviews employers can make\nGreat [laughter] God I Love you I look at every meeting me a there are a few really easy things that employers can do\nSleep to include people with narrow diverse into their talent pool\nThe first thing is in their job descriptions are if they take away a corporate speak so something that means something to um the point means absolutely nothing to everybody else outside\nI if you say looking for an extrovert or group leader or a exciting abilities you know those words will make an autistic person not apply\nOkay I'm a dynamic that's another one get rid of those words because an autistic person will not applied to that job be very very specific about what the job is\nNow what typically happens is jobs the managers don't know what they want so they use these very loose\nA statements the looser they are\nThe more people apply except you exclude narrow diverse people Mm okay the second thing is if they are if his company tries to recruit through a college they'd want to not use um the huge college recruitment fair\nI one of the descriptions was given to me by an autistic person was those fares\nAre like being your most hung over just imagine this being the most hung over you've ever been the need to go on a roller coaster doing loops with three year old little girl screaming in your ear no that's the sensory overload and those rooms\nSo the autistic people can go in there\nSo if you're trying to employ autistic or neuro diverse people do a quiet room do a different type of recruitment that would be very very helpful so maybe a a\nPizza lunch where they can talk about what they like to do and you can talk about the company um another thing they can do is\nStopped doing the uh do you know excel no and then stopping the interview so what part of excel do you really enjoy\nAnd then you can find out a better ...\nAre much better for autistic person\nNow make so much sense eight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number if you'd like to join the conversation this morning eight six six nine

W. W. dot a and E. dot org um and there are people um listed there that can answer some of those funding questions but I'm the\nOther aspect of a A N e is that we do not have any geographic\nBoundaries so even though the program in the office is located in Watertown, Massachusetts um we provide services and support for people throughout um the greater Boston area New England and in the country as well and\nI Want to ask you about this very little money raised by advocacy groups addresses the the day to day needs of autistic people and their families and that's an area that we're\nWe we really need to pay more attention to\nAbsolutely I there are so many from early intervention all the way through to employment ah what is important is that uh not only financial needs but a actual support from a\nKnowing what a and this is great that you're on Leslie about the supports that are there from the federal government\nOne of the big problems and challenges is when you're fourteen years old under the workforce innovation and opportunity act you are supposed to receive unemployment plan\nAnd that implanted plan should be able to give you an opportunity to access jobs\n[noise] most schools across the United states do not do this effectively and worse they don't connect with community colleges\nA third level degrees\nA ... a four year colleges and if the person isn't able to do a or doesn't want to do a third level of degree they should be connecting with their local vocational rehabilitation services office so that they can get a job ... what happens is we call it\nThe cliff and and this is really scary um you know only Seventeen ... percent of autistic people go to college for your school\nThe rest of them the vast majority fall into that class ... and so the financial supports that families need is a ... a I'll go back one more thing to us as he said\nUm when a family finds out they have an autistic kid almost every time the first thing the parents think is what's gonna happen when I die absolutely mhm\nAnd so that is a level of support\n[laughter] why is it is frightening so they need help with ah the future finances are building a trust are not getting caught in what's called the FBI myth where if my child gets a job than they are not going to be able to access government services [noise]\nAh there is so much misinformation out there\nThat I keeps autistic and narrow diverse people in a poverty trap\nBetter so and that makes them feel very important to be able to read and did and and he would\nUm share that with me following his work there and he would say Michael and I are working on this project that I had this great idea of how we could solve this problem and this is what we we did and it was such a\nSense of accomplishment and uh as I mentioned before in feeling part of the team and contributing and contributing yeah that was I mean\nYeah so one thing that I think was important about this is even though we were lacking as Michael said the infrastructure to do this officially a we did not let bureaucracy generally we found a way to get them into a very complicated and frankly high pressure situation\nYou know and this material is being prepared for a research cruise the costs tens of thousands of dollars a day there's multiple experiments going on at any given time all the stuff has to work this lab is full of tubes wires things the bubble burp do all kinds of of strange things are and Sam was right in there\nYou could apply to these problems are and it was just really really awful to see whether it concerns me having concerned about interesting such an important project to an intern and and if so how did you address that we put them together to work with Michael mhm daily needed [laughter] all of\nThe ah tasks of hand we're so I'm unique the salmon I had to work side by side it was five week volunteers ship and for the first four weeks we totally works ... and in the last week\nI have I have a a task that uh he worked on independently but prior to that I'm a ... a basically\nThe the tests were so I'm diverse jumping from one experiment to answer certain question to another\nThat you couldn't uh work independently although we needed to work together to Beth who's calling from found was Hi Beth\nHi Mindy is a single mom they're doing it yeah [laughter] I\nUm I don't I'm going to have trouble calming down I'm just so happy to hear that show it makes me so happy I'm inspired I I Want to thank you many for doing it and Tara\nI'm for expertise and I'm just going to go along with her to help change the world

vision I'm at age twenty three he had and he had an idea of what he liked but he really couldn't see an example of where he could be in the future I'm employed in a meaningful a job where he's engaged he's stimulating any stimulated these con\nTribute hang up to six to society and and you guys gave that to him so thank you so much\nUm another thing just to talk about um you were talking about the

before the break that was telling us how what Sam got out of this internship so Michael and Rob\nWell first of all Sam helped me a lot in the lab and a lot of physical ways which\nIt was it was very handy to have a second set of hands in the lab um sometimes you'd be working on one side of the the stack of instruments working on plumbing\nBut on the other side there would be a flow meter and if one person could be on one side and the other person the other types direct feedback on the effect of ah changes that you're\nDoing to the plumbing also data entry sometimes you'd be across the lab looking at the uh read out from the instrument and reading the numbers off to the other person who'd be data doing data entry on a spreadsheet on a different computer so physically he helped me a lot and ah [noise]\nAlso we we we uh we worked at a really fast pace and I think that I wouldn't have been working I definitely wouldn't have been working as fast without Sam there [noise] um [noise]\nAnd it was it was fun being in the lab with them talking with them and ah um we really appreciate the help that he gave us we got we successfully did prepare for that crews and everything went\nWell I I may I jump in real yeah shorter had to do what\nI got out of this was you guys get spell the notion and this story that autistic people can only do repetitive actions\nSo I'm One of the big stereotype is that a autistic people only liked to do the same thing over and over and over again and there was it seems ah from what you described Michael that this was very much a\nThis is what we're going to do today and again and then the next day with something different and with different scales different tools required and ah what Sam was able to do\nIs quite extraordinary because many people wouldn't be able to handle that type of pressure or the constant change so I I Will be using this story in the future\nYou know that that thank you yeah I have a\nShort while this was certainly an eye opener for us this was the first time and I remember the morning or an early summer when Michael walking into my office in ... and he said\nWe have an opportunity we don't have a way to do it how do we make this work and I said well let's figure out a way and it it just made us more\nWhat we can look for in potential employees or what kinds of opportunities we have again that this goes back to the matching the people to the skills are and we have lots of needs across the skills spectrum that are that are diverse people have and it taught us I think\nFirst hand how to successfully build this kind of relationship uh we need to have a really good mentor which Michael certainly is um we need to have the right person match to the right job and ultimately what we also got out of it is a hub\nAnd increased understanding of how we can participate in this larger bureau initiative which is being role that initially in pretty you know our our larger USGS locations and headquarters near Washington DC and our Denver air a office out in Menlo Park California\nUm but here's a place where there's there's no shortage of people with needs and we can meet that in our local community so that

God I Love you I look at every meeting me a there are a few really easy things that employers can do first\nLate to include people with narrow diverse into their talent pool the first thing is in their job descriptions are if they take away\nA corporate speak so something that means something to um the point means absolutely nothing to everybody else outside\nI if you say looking for an extrovert or group leader or a exciting abilities you know those words will make an autistic person not apply\nOkay I'm a dynamic that's another one get rid of those words because an autistic person will not apply to that job [noise] be\nVery very specific about what the job is\nNow what typically happens is jobs the managers don't know what they want so they use these very loose a statements the looser they are\nThe more people apply except you exclude narrow diverse people Mm okay the second thing is if they are if his company tries to recruit through a college they'd want to not use um the huge college recruitment fair\nI one of the descriptions was given to me by an autistic person was those fares\nAre like being your most hung over just imagine this being the most hung over you've ever been the need to go on a roller coaster doing loops with three year old little girl screaming in your ear now that's the sensory overload and those rooms\nSo the autistic people can't go in there so if you're trying to employ autistic or neuro diverse people do a quiet room\nDo it different type of recruitment that would be very very helpful so maybe a a pizza lunch where they can talk about what they like to do and you can talk about the company um another thing they can do is\nStop doing the uh do you know excel no and then stopping the interview\nThen you can find out a better answer open ended questions are much better for an autistic person makes much sense\nEight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number if you'd like to join the conversation this morning eight six six nine nine nine for six to six or email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org we'll talk more after a quick break [noise]\nSupportive since the nurse helps WC I deliver quality NPR programming with a focus on this community if you've been contributing at the same level for a while maybe you're ready to increase your monthly giving by a few dollars those extra dollars can make a big difference in our ability to bring you the local hands national news and programs you depend on\nYou can increase your support easily at Cape and islands dot org slash update\nSupport comes from you and from members of our founders circle who's generosity keeps double UCI strong and independent including Laura and bill Paulson and steep Bernie or were grateful for your support and for the support of all of our members\n[noise]\n\n\nJeff Morris former curator of the pilgrim monument museum\nSo what we have here is a wouldn't chain of nine links and significance as I was little by someone out of one single piece of wood [noise] this is what we call even hands busy before TV for radio [noise] people that crafty things around the house because [noise]\nThe law in New England winter [laughter]\nYou're listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations\nYou're listening to the point and we are talking about expanding neuro diversity in the workplace this hour on the phone with us this chair Cunningham she's CEO of special district us a\nAnd now joining us in Studio Leslie man she's a life mapped coach with the Asperger's autism network welcome Leslie thank you and it's Leslie bark I'm Sorry that's OK I'm explaining the mission of Asperger's autism network yes the aspect or autism network works with\nIndividuals and families to help people with Asperger's syndrome and narrow diverse profile build means full and connected live a a A N e was founded in Nineteen Ninety six and is a nonprofit community an organization\nEducation support and community for adults families and professionals working in the field all with people with diverse backgrounds and autism and a and he has also of an inclusive community um and we provide\nSupport and services throughout a person's life span so for example I'm a family who might first learned that their child has been diagnosed with autism I'm as a as a very young child can contact um the Asperger autism network and and make connections there\nAnd then programs and services go forward throughout childhood adolescents young adulthood and an aunt um ... really mature adults as well so it it is very a comprehensive throughout a person's life span\nSo who who's eligible do referrals and how has it who pays okay it is a nonprofit and um so the funding comes from various sources um I'm not a a funding person so I Would refer people to\nThe uh the website the a and you website is W. W. W. dot H. A. N. E. dot org um and there are people um listed there that can answer some of those funding questions but I'm the\nOther aspect of a A N e is that we do not have any geographic\nBoundaries so even though the program in the office is located in Watertown, Massachusetts oh we provide services and support for people throughout um the greater Boston area New England and in the country as well and\nSo I Want to ask you about this very little money raised by advocacy groups addresses the the day to day needs of autistic people and their families and that's an area that we're\nWe we really need to pay more attention to\nOh absolutely I there are so many needs from early intervention all the way through to employment ah\nWhat is important is that uh not only financial needs but an actual support from a\nKnowing what a and this is great that you're on Leslie about the support that are there from the federal government one of the big problems and challenges is when you're fourteen years old under the workforce innovation and opportunity act you are supposed to receive unemployment plan\nBe able to give you an opportunity to access jobs and eat your passions and skills most schools across the United states do not do this effectively and worse they don't connect with community colleges\nA third level degrees\nA ... a four year colleges and if the person isn't able to do a or doesn't want to do a third level of degree they should be connecting with their local vocational rehabilitation services office\nSo that they can get a job ... what happens is we call it the cliff and and this is really scary um you know only Seventeen twenty four percent of autistic people go to college for your school\nThe rest of them the vast majority fall into that class ... and so the financial supports that families need is a ... a a go back one more thing to us as he said\nOn when a family finds out they have an autistic kid almost every time the first thing the parents think is\nWhat's gonna happen when I die absolutely ... and so that is a level of support [laughter] by is is frightening so they need help with\nAh the future finances are building a trust\nAre not getting caught in what's called the FBI myth where if my child gets a job than they're not going to be able to access government services [noise] ah there is so much misinformation out there that I keeps\nAutistic and narrow diverse people in a poverty trap and so uh they really do need support on so many levels\nTo matter so and that makes them feel very important to be able to read and it did and and he would\nUm share that with me following his work there and he would say Michael and I are working on this project it I had this great idea of how we could solve this problem and this is what we we did and it was such a\nSense of accomplishment and ah as I mentioned before in feeling part of the team and cannot read bidding and contributing yeah that was I mean\nYeah so one thing that I think was important about this is even though we were lacking as Michael said the infrastructure to do this officially a we did not let bureaucracy you know we found a way to get them into a very complicated and frankly high pressure situation\nYou know this material is being prepared for a research cruise the costs tens of thousands of dollars a day there's multiple experiments going on at any given time all the stuff has to work this lab is full of too\nDo all kinds of range things ah and Tim was right in there he found the skills that you could apply to these problems ah and it was just really really officer or whether it concerns me having concerned about interesting such an important project to an intern and and if so how did you address that\nWe put them together to work with Michael mhm but the only needed [laughter] all of the er tasks at hand we're so I'm unique the salmon I had to work side by side\nIt was five week volunteers ship and for the first four weeks we totally works ... and in the last week I have I have a a task that uh he worked on independently but prior to that I'm a ... a basically\nThe the tests were so I'm diverse jumping from one\nExperiment to answer certain question to another\nThat you couldn't uh work independently although we needed to where to go to Beth who's calling from found this\nHi Beth Hi Mindy is a single mom they're doing it yeah [laughter]\nI Am I I'm going to have trouble calming down I'm just so happy to\nHear that show it makes me so happy I'm inspired I I Want to thank you many for doing it and Tara I'm or expertise and I'm just\nGoing to go along with her to help change the world and\nA lovely Michael Robin Caroline is not there um thank you for what you um what you've done and what your uh\nStill doing Lesley first Sam I'm I I think the show is doing a great job about a show and what the difficulties are and also an example of how it can be successful\nUm to what I thought I Would share is just what what um they experience gave to our family was it gave escape Sam of vision\nI'm at age twenty three he hadn't that he had an idea of what he liked but he really couldn't see an example of where he could be in the future I'm employed in a meaningful\nA job where he's engaged he's stimulating any stimulated these con tribute hang up to six to society and and you guys gave that to him so thank you so\nMuch um another thing just to talk about um you were talking about the expertise and what a carriage doing in training and how Leslie supporting but I also want to kind of put out there that um\nSome basic\nAutism network we also have robbed the director of the USGS which will center and Michael Castle physical scientist at USGS eight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number is eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point at Cape and islands that or\nSo before the break that was telling us how what Sam got out of this internship so Michael and Rob what did you guys get out of this internship well first of all\nSam helped me a lot in the lab and a lot of physical ways which it was\nIt was very handy to have a second set of hands in the lab um sometimes you'd be working on one side of the the stack of instruments working on plumbing\nBut on the other side there would be a flow meter and if one person could be on one side and the other person the other types of direct feedback on the effect of ah changes that you're\nDoing to the plumbing also data entry sometimes you'd be across the lab looking at the uh read out from the instrument and reading the numbers off to the other person who'd be did doing data entry on a spreadsheet on a different computer so physically he helped me a lot and ah [noise]\nAlso we we we uh we worked at a really fast pace and I think that I wouldn't have been working I definitely wouldn't have been working as fast without Sam there [noise] um [noise]\nAnd it was it was fun being in love with him talking with them and ah um we really appreciate the help that he gave us we got we successfully did prepare for that crews and everything went well\nI I may I jump in real yeah shorter had their out\nWhat I got out of this was you guys dispel the notion and this story that autistic people can only do repetitive actions\nSo I'm One of the big stereotypes as at a autistic people only liked to do the same thing over and over and over again and there was it seems ah from what you described Michael that this was very much a\nThis is what we're going to do today and you dug in and then the next day was something different or with different skills different tools required and ah what family is able to do\nIs quite extraordinary because many people wouldn't be able to handle that type of pressure or the constant change so I I Will be using this story\nThank you yeah I have a short while this was certainly an eye opener for us this is the first time and I remember the morning or an early summer when Michael walking into my office in ... and he said\nWe have an opportunity we don't have a way to do it how do we make this work and I said well let's figure out a way and it it\nMade us more aware of what we can look for in potential employees or what kinds of opportunities we have again that this goes back to the matching the people to the skills are and we have lots of needs it across the skill spectrum that are\nThat are a diverse people have and it taught us I think\nFirst hand how to successfully built this kind of relationship uh we need to have a really good mentor which Michael certainly is a we need to have the right person match to the right job and ultimately what we also got out of it is a hub", "show_name": "The Point", "year": "2018", "city":
