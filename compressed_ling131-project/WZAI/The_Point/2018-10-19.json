into print and digital media joining me in the studio in just a few\nIndeed McCormick and later in the program we will be speaking with Tim would keep a chronicle in ... province town then or in Bryan down at the Martha's Vineyard times will start this morning speaking with Bill ... at the vineyard ... good morning bill\nWarning Steve how're you doing ... I'm doing well but I was up late watching the red Sox game\n[laughter] it continues it keeps going on\nStill are the schools that just came out recently and you have a look at the changing population on the school system that tell us what's happening here\nYeah exactly the school fences came out this month and a particular note with the long and steady rise in the English language learner population in other words students who have little or no English when they enter school\nIn two thousand twelve Seventy three students fit this category today three hundred and twenty seven students fit this category or Fifteen Percent of the entire student body on the island\nNow in the vineyard this predominantly the Brazilian students who speak Brazilian Portuguese as their first language and it was often happens with certain stories it got me thinking and I didn't take a little detour here because I went into the our cars and it sort of thought well how did this all began\nAnd if we really were able to pinpoint it to one man back in Nineteen eighty five Lyndon Johnson Pierre\nWho came here from a town of guy a Berra about an hour north of Rio and the reason we know this is because a reporter at the guy that then ... and actually went to Brazil to find this guy on sort of um you know\nDetail the beginnings of this incredible migration so she found him he told her story about you know coming here as a young man to to America to make money with outside of Boston\nAnd then was working at a restaurant and someone said hey there's a restaurant in the vineyard looking for someone to work there and so we came here\nSaid um according to the store he was the only Brazilian here back in Nineteen eighty five\nReally dug it wrote home um and then about a year and a half later he did have to go home because his father was ill but he told people about it next year twenty people came and it just kept going so really it's kind of fascinating you can go back to this one small towns fast forward to today\nThe ... community is a huge an important part of the island community um as the census is pointing out to now back to the schools they really had to adapt to the increasing number I'm currently they have about two or three E L L teachers in each school um\nSay a student typically if they come into the into the schools in kindergarten with little or no English there'll be proficient by fourth grade they also said of course it's complicated their schedule\nTim teacher contracts have stalled ed ... school district these discussions every teacher contracts at the high school or one consequence has been the loss of a popular program tell us about\nA indeed uh the most recent contract between the modern way original school district which covers chattering are which and it's a main teachers' union expired on June thirtieth so teachers went into\nAgreement negotiations or have been ongoing but one of the casualties of the failure to reach an agreement as far as ... as a ... hour\nNow this is a program that was launched just about a year ago [noise] uh and it's a one hour block which includes the lunch a lunch period [noise] uh that allow students to ah do a number of things including a seeking extra help from teachers and working on clubs and other projects\nOr since the time involved in a in the ... an hour is is subject to labor negotiations because it involves a teachers are providing\nAssistance to students or the initial trial phase of the program was run under\nA ... was a was a agreement was reached to run a trial program for a year until a new contract was negotiated\nA and a last week union president Sherry in Armstrong's said that that trial phase at this point is over until it can be adjusted our details can be worked into a new agreement [noise]\nUh and uh so the jaw some a program officially ended a last last week on this week actually on Monday she praised the program what she said had strongly supported was strongly supported by faculty administrators and students\nAre allowed students um for instance who can't come to school early or stay late because of jobs are family obligations to get that extra help\nAnd it also gives students the ability to ah to make their own decisions about their time and help foster a sort of autonomy and and personal growth um [noise]\nYou know the are are strong a set out last week school committee meeting that are teachers or should not be blamed for the program ending um that it's a caught up in a very complex negotiation situation a which neither she nor a school committee chairman John Richardson\nWould really go into detail about um they they really wouldn't tell us what the sticking points are in the contract at this at this uh junction\nA as usual negotiations are subject to a executive sessions at which the public and press are not allowed um although\nWe've been able to ascertain that to the basically the ... they're talking about the compensation issues which are as as you know is is usually the sticking point when it comes to to contracts labor contracts um and now there was a strong show support for teachers at the school committee meeting with dozens of them are holding signs\nSpeaking in favor of the teachers and ah and ... and also talking in support of the the the stress of our program or the other the next step in the process of actually held a mediation session or this past week um and uh we we haven't heard from either party as to how progress when an obsession\nBut they say that they're they're trying to reach a settlement as soon as possible\nSo they can they can restore the the ... hour program which uh which everybody seemed to a degree was was a good thing for school\nTim wood from the Cape cod chronicled Tim thanks for that\nLike you do with me in the studio is Cindy McCormick from the Cape cod time Cindy election day is coming up November six but early voting begins next week you're reporter Jeff spleen is a nice look at how the process works it's still kind of a new process for town officials\nThat this was the early voting was that the state is offering at once again from the mid term elections and town clerk's and the Cape are bracing for heavy turnout so this was on the Wu is in two thousand sixty and that was a presidential election and the early voting was a very popular\nTown clerk's had also was administrate of nightmare because the first time they've handled it and uh and they said that they've worked out a lot of the kinks this time around that they've identified the issues and and worked it out nearly fifty thousand people that's thirty percent Cape Cod registered voters cast ballots before election day and in two thousand six\nI felt that was a high number I was surprised to see\nThat yeah and they said that ... you know to be just as popular not even more now because he's mid term elections are you know attracting a lot of attention and uh they think that the people who enjoy the early voting the last time around will want to do it again and that other people want to try it because they've heard good things about it\nAnd the early voting this year it takes place in October twenty second to November second at the deadline to register was Wednesday this past this Wednesday\nOr having gone through this process ones in twenty sixteen town administrators have an idea of what to expect a little bit and and how to tweak the process to make it easier for them\nSo yeah and and done at the town clerk's response ah well she ... she's one of the people thinks it's going to be hiring on a higher early voting turnout and she has a she and officials there have set up several voting booth in a town hall conference from to give it the appearance of a typical precinct polling place\nAnd why is it such a an administrative burden for these town officials\nWell the first time around it was just you know working out the different kings and the different way and on and keeping track of everything and just in the counting it was just I'm a ... or just a a ...\nThey feel they've got things under control a they know how it works and I know what to expect oh they don't know quite what to expect because they don't know how that turned on us not to be\nAnd these ballots these early voting belt actually we have to be kept in a vault until election day to be counted\nRight and they have to yeah there's there's probably it sounds like a little bit more security issues around and just because you have\nYou know things coming in at different times and uh at the same ...\nSame places but oh and then the other thing is that they have um [noise] that ... many local town halls are offering I extended a weekday our as he can come so normally they close you know the certain time but they're offering extended we'd hours so that people can vote after work and some are going to be open on Saturday October twenty seventh\nAnd I guess one thing out administrators are pointing to is that uh this requires a fair amount of additional work and there's no additional funding for most of these\nTowns to cope with it right because you've got the additional hours and obviously someone has to be staffing those additional our it ends up\nAs a kind of an unfunded mandate one of them is pointing out on a following up on a story we spoke about last week local legislators weighed in on the steam ship authorities proposed design for new ferry terminal they didn't sound very happy about what was being suggest\nNow a senator a state senator of any Timothy Kudo who's probably came from Plymouth in state representative Dylan Fernandez Democrat from here and what's whole have asked the steam ship authority to go back to the drawing board for the design of the new ferry terminal and what's home\nAnd what are they are concerned about\nHere well ... well they're ... they're concerned because residents are\nSeem to be pretty unhappy with the design that was unveiled was glasses on building a resident saddle up too much like a ski lodge an aspirin and actually both legislators seemed to be a of the same view\nAnd they wrote an open letter to Robert Davis he's the general manager of the woods hole Martha's Vineyard in anti could seem ship authority and they said the building will define what's home for a million visitors for decades to come at you looked like what's all\n... and ... and um it's a big building that's being proposed I can tell you that looking at the article says that it's going to be about forty five feet high\nYeah it's actually thirty five feet high but the buildup of land under ... to ... keep it out of the floods on the elevator forty five feet and that's an issue because presents also say it's gonna obliterate the quintessential what's whole view from the crane Street Bridge that\nThat kind of like landmark view or it's going to be the classic fuel will be gone and that's another issue with him\nAnd representative Fernandez suggesting that perhaps the designed to resemble something more like with the the other island terminals\nHe said he some ... terminals and that they successfully incorporate into New England slavery and the town where there are located now the architects be I ... a studio said last week that they thought that the salt box designed reflected in New England design and they also said you know the the rock and the um the stone in the class would hold up to the elements but\nLocal residents like now looks like Aspen\nThat's been a big construction project overall they're looking at a six year ... going to be\nYeah sixty million dollars three new ferry slips into new passenger loading here is a very important project for the Cape them was home\nWe're going to speak right now is ed Miller the province town bad or good morning ed good morning Steve ... province town has a special town meeting coming up tell us about what's on the agenda here\nWell yes uh October twenty ninth is the upcoming special town meeting and province town and uh it seems appropriate for Halloween week 'cause looking at the warrant it seems pretty scary um [laughter] it's a it's a long warrant first special town meeting twenty six articles\nAnd um there's a variety of issues uh dealt with um including a to land acquisitions\nUm the Elaine hall property on commercials street and the Dwyer property on Bradford street these are a parcels that the open space committee and problems down\nHas been seeking for a while a hall property a involves a a a a piece of beach front that uh the uh conservationists in town would very much like to preserve\nBack this is the news round up on the point we're discussing the top local news stories of the week I'm Steve Juncker joining me from the Cape cod time says Cindy McCormick\nCindy we were just speaking about the ... bid for casino in what it means for the land in trust meanwhile the ... tribe is suing the ... conservation commission and this has to do with oyster awkward culture around an area that may be facing development\nYeah this is let's concerns goose Barry Island and they in order for it in order to develop anything you have to\nAdmit I'm a lifting ... wetlands around your property and the master ... trying to think that this lifting or ... submitted by the owners of goes back to the conservation commission did not um which was an accurate\nAnd at neglected to include a coastal dune and coastal beach and tidal flats and this is all very close to\nThe ... fish hatchery and they said this is of concern to them because they're afraid they'll be developed and that will impact their selfish resources\nWho's very island has a little bit of history here of the owners wanting to develop it\nYeah they've actually monetize they've ... they want it\nThey wanted to bridge belt and that was turned down and then they actually want to do one a a a a house built and that was also turned down and that was turned down initially because they\nThe town officials were like well there's no access how if there's a fire how how ... how are firefighters get out there and so they came back with his proposal for a bridge but that was um that was also turned down\nA the tribe is concerned that has some development happens there they're all they're waster aquaculture as you say they're actually they're nurseries is right up against that\nYes um and then uh George Pataki green is the types of natural resources and he says it's not just the ... he says the whole town is going to suffer for house goes up on that island he says that a septic system there would not served a purpose that ...\nNow because wasters climbs the water and this has been the Detroit has been working with the town to improve the water quality of the ... and and water areas and and and the ...\nAnd the oysters themselves improving the water quality right exactly or the town conservation commission what do they have to say about the lawsuit\nWell they say that this you know that the fact that this at these coastal dunes in that close to each other titles last weren't specifically spelled out\nYou know won't have doesn't mean that they're not going to be reviewed and ... and any project that comes off that doesn't it doesn't mean that they're not going to consider that\nSo you're saying it wasn't really a mistake and they will be considering that the entire egos\nRight and this is a three point five acre island ...\nWe're going to speak right now with Brian doubted the Martha's Vineyard times good morning Brian Steve how's it going going well Ryan you've got a story about a new program for school athletics it's called the unified sports league explained is for

of the highlights from that conversation\nSure yeah I got a chance to uh speak with secretary former secretary Kennedy and uh he\nUh Kerry told me he lost his Kari excuse he told me about it is a new biography or every day's extra and he was one of the highlights that his title is I'm kind of a philosophy on life city that he got when he was serving in Vietnam about how\nEach day that you have is an extra day and uh you know what do you do with that day and uh he's done quite a lot [noise] and uh he talked about everything from his childhood to time Vietnam a time as a congressman and it's a a\nN during the presidential election ...\nEye you also ask them a little bit about his island life it sounds like he suffered from a condition many of us have during the summer he was working so much this bad somebody didn't get as much time to spend as he would've liked doing things like sailing and being sort of enjoying his time on the island\nYeah he was so focused on writing a biography that he said he regretted he didn't get to go out as much to some of his favorite venue places I'm like the red cat a cardboard box and especially back or don't see the huge battered on its fan\nBrian down from the Martha's Vineyard times Brian thank you for joining us this morning like Steve\nWith me in the studio is Cindy ... from the Cape cod times Cindy any advise every group met last week to take on issues\nThis yeah this meeting ended last week a week ago on friday with some suggestions that such as more temporary area closures and possible testing new technologies that will\nChange fishing gear so it costs us less harm to the north Atlantic right whales and this is according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fisheries biologists calling Coogan now um I met ours are Sawyer from the Massachusetts lobstermen association said that there was extremes on both ends but they're trying to work toward\nThe fishermen are ... and and lobstermen are trying to work with a scientist toward a solution that will benefit that will\nThat both sides can agree with that will be meeting again in March about this\nAnd what are some of the ideas they have for how to protect large whales write wills\nOne of the ... well ... one of the things is you know to change the fishing gear or sell it releases there's you know they have right now they say there are about ... million vertical fishing lines connecting trapped in there for his bullies and areas of the U.S and Canada we're right well migrate calf and an forage for food and so this is they get in tangled in scarce they're talking about you know\nUh sometimes like a\n... that the fishing of traps that do not actually\nAre actually connected by particle lines that you would find me using technology and ... wrote the rock literally system and also just um having temporary closure in some areas where there are shipped strikes for instance where there seem to be a number of ships strikes because this is a ... that right well population is really in decline\nIt took an unusual hit last year with a document to death of Seventeen animals and can eat in us waters\nSo far there's been two deaths this year or one of the huge issues is that what's happening to the females in this population they uh there's a there's a greater number of years between when the females get birth and there's an overall lack of tennis\nThere were zero last year and the concern is that um well the population was four hundred and fifty one and two thousand six team and that's compared to let's say two thousand ten peak was four hundred and eighty one and it's been declining since then and science and say that all the recovery that was achieved leading up to two thousand ten\nUm ... the three years of recovery will be lost by twenty twenty nine if the current rate of ...\nA decline continues and there are other issues that are less in the control of fisherman but they say that the um there's an usually fast warming of the Gulf of Maine that was a September mental that came out and so what's happening is that a lobsters are getting these um from this\nUnexpected or an anticipated warmth lobsters are developing shell disease\nUs and that is putting them in contact with these whales more into passes away on the path of whales\nThe wheels are looking for food and so it's like their food source is also shifting with warming waters\nYeah their food sources are are shifting and they're going into the Gulf of St Lawrence and the females you know all all the wheels are following the food source of course but the problem is the females have off of Florida Georgia and this\nExtra mileage actually takes a toll on them you know uses more energy so they're just not in as good shape as they would have been otherwise and they and that makes them even even a healthy well could be destroyed by a fish up by a vote strike or a becoming hopelessly entangled in fishing lines\nBut even ... but some do survive and but it's better if you're healthy ... and a stronger whale and are able to recover\nAnd we are talking specifically about right whales and one other thing I Want to mention that they talked about here was about the ropes that can break at a a lesser a strength they're talking about a week or ropes fishing with weak erode week fishing with me groves\nAnd from our business sponsors whose

in the vineyards is predominantly the Brazilian students who speak Brazilian Portuguese of their first language\nNow as often happens with certain stories it got me thinking and I didn't take a little detour here because I went into the archives and it's sort of thought well how did this all began\nAnd if we really they were able to pinpoint it to one man back in Nineteen eighty five Lyndon Johnson here\nWho came here from a town of guy a Berra about an hour north of Rio and the reason we know that is because a reporter that then ... and actually went to Brazil to find this guy on sort of um you know detail the beginnings of this incredible migration\nSo she found him he told her story about you know coming here as a young man to to America to make money with outside of Boston and then I\nWas working in a restaurant and someone said hey this restaurant on the vineyard looking for someone to work there and so we came here\nFed 'em according to the story was the only Brazilian here back in Nineteen eighty five really dug it wrote home um and then about a year and a half later he did have to go home because his father was ill but he told people about it next year twenty people came and it just kept going so that really is kind of fascinating\nFast forward to today the Brazilian community is a huge an important part of the island community um at the fence is pointing out to\nNow back to the schools they really had to adapt to the increasing number I'm currently they have about two or three e El Al teachers in each school\nUm they say a student typically if they come into the vein into the schools in kindergarten with little to no English there'll be proficient by fourth grade they also said of course it's complicated they're scheduling um in hiring and there's also different levels of proficiency and different ages but\nOn the phone with us right now from the Cape cod comical is Tim Lynn Good morning to him a good morning Steve Tim teacher contracts have stalled ... school district these discussions every teacher contracts at the high school or one consequence has been the loss of a popular program tell us about\nA indeed are the most recent contract between the amount of my regional school district which covers chattering are rich and it's a main teachers' union\nExpired on June thirtieth so teachers went into this academic year working without a labor agreement negotiations or had been ongoing but one of the casualties of the failure to reach an agreement as far as ... as a ... hour now this is a program that was launched just about a year ago [noise]\nUh and it's a one hour block which includes the launch a lunch period a that allow students to ah do a number of of things including a seeking extra help from teachers and working on clubs and other projects\nOr since the time involved in a in the ... an hour is is subject to labor negotiations because it involves a teachers are providing\nAssistance to students or the initial trial phase of the program was run under a ... was a was a agreement was reached to run a trial program for a year until a new contract was negotiated\nA and a last week union president Sherry and Armstrong said that that trial phase at this point is over until it can be adjusted our details can be worked into a new agreement\n[noise] ah and ah so the jaw some a program officially ended a last last week on this week actually on Monday she praised the program what she said had strongly supported was strongly supported by faculty administrators and students\nAre allowed students um for instance who can't come to school early or stay late because of jobs are family obligations to get that extra help\nAnd also give students the ability to ah to make their own decisions about their time and help foster a sort of autonomy and and personal growth um\n[noise] you know the are are strong a set out last week school committee meeting that are teachers or should not be blamed for the program ending um that it's a caught up in a very complex negotiation\nSituation a which neither she nor a school committee chairman John Richardson would really go into detail about um they they really wouldn't tell us what\nAt this juncture in a as usual negotiations are subject to a executive sessions at which the public and press are not allowed\nUm although we've been able to ascertain that to the basically the that they're talking about the compensation issues which as as you know is is usually the sticking point when it comes to to contract so labor contracts\nUm there was a strong show support for teachers at the school committee meeting with dozens of them are holding signs\nAre students are speaking in favor of ah the teachers and ah and it also talking in support of the the the stress on our program\nAre now the next step in this process uh they actually held a mediation session or this past week um and ah we we haven't heard from either party as to how progress in that session but they say that they're they're trying to reach a settlement as soon as possible\nSo they can they can restore the the ... hour program which uh which everybody seemed to agree was was a good thing for school\nTim wood from the Cape cod chronicle Tim thanks for that\nThank you Steve with me in the studio is Cindy McCormick from the Cape cod time Cindy election days coming up November six but early voting begins next week you're reporter Jeff spleen is a nice look at how the process works it's still kind of a new process for town officials\nThat this was the early voting was that the state is offering at once again from the mid term elections in town clerk's and they keep are bracing for heavy turnout so this was on the ... in two thousand sixty and that was a presidential election and the early voting was a very popular town clerk's had also with him in a state of nightmare\nBecause the first time they've handled it and uh and they said that they've\nWorked out a lot of the kinks this time around that that they've identified the issues and and worked it out you were like fifty thousand people that's\nThirty percent Cape has registered voters cast ballots before election day and in two thousand six\nI thought that was a high number I was surprised to see\nThat yeah and they said that and they're acting you know to be just as popular not even more now because these midterm elections are you know attracting a lot of attention\nAnd they think that the people who enjoy didn't really building the last time around will want to do it again and that other people want to try it because they've heard good things about it and the early voting this year it takes place in October twenty second to November second at the deadline to register was Wednesday this past this Wednesday\nOr having gone through this process ones in twenty sixteen town administrators have an idea of what to expect a little bit and and how to tweak the price\nAnd and done at the town clerk's response ah well she ... she's one of the people thinks it's going to be hiring on the higher but early voting turnout and ah she has a she and officials there have set up several voting booth in a town hall conference room to give it the appearance of a typical precinct polling place\nAnd why is it such a an administrative burden for these town officials\nWell the first time around it was just you know working out the different ... and the different way and on and keeping track of everything and just and and the counting it was just I'm a ... or just a a ... at\nThe initial experience but this time they feel they've got things under control a they know how it works and I know what to expect oh they don't know quite what to expect because they don't know how that turnout is going to be\nAnd these ballots these early voting belt actually we have to be kept in a vault until election day to be counted\nRight and they have to yeah there's there's probably it sounds like a little bit more security issues around and just because you have you know things coming in at different times and uh at the same ...\nSame places but oh then the other thing is that they have on that ... many local town halls are offering I extended a weekday our as he can come so normally they close you know the certain time but they're offering extended we'd hours so that people can vote after work and some are going to be open on Saturday October twenty seventh\nAnd I guess one thing to administrators are pointing to is that uh this requires a fair amount of additional work and there's no additional funding for most of these towns to cope with it\nRight right 'cause you've got to additional hours and obviously someone has to be staffing those additional our\nIt ends up as a kind of an unfunded mandate one of them is pointing out a following up on a story we spoke about last week local legislators weighed in on the steam ship authorities proposed designed for new ferry terminal they didn't sound very happy about what was being suggest\nNow a senator a state senator of any Timothy Kudo who's probably came from Plymouth in state representative done Fernandez Democrat from here and what's whole have asked the steam ship authority to go back to the drawing board for the design that the new ferry terminal was home\nAnd what are they are concerned about\nHere well ... well they're ... they're concerned because residents have seemed to be\nPretty unhappy with the design that was unveiled there was a glasses on building a resident saddle up too much like a ski lodge in Aspen and actually both legislators it seemed to be a of the same view and they wrote an open letter to Robert Davis he's the general manager of the woods hole Martha's\nVineyard anti could seem ship authority and they said the building will define what's home front lines of is there is for decades to come it should look like what's all\n[noise] and ah and um it's a big building that's being proposed I can tell you that\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nThey'll say it's going to obliterate just quintessential what's whole view from the main street bridge that that kind of like landmark view or what it's going to be the class if you will be gone and that's another issue with him\nAnd representative Fernandez is suggesting that perhaps the designed to resemble something more like with the the other island terminals look like on Nantucket in vineyard\nYeah he said he suppressed their terminals and that they successfully incorporated the New England slavery and the town where there are located now the architects be I ... a studio said last week that they thought that the Sox designed reflected New England design and they also said you know the the rock and the um the stone in the class would hold up to the elements but\nLocal residents like now looks like Aspen\nThat's been a big construction project overall they're looking at a six year rebuild of this ... going to be\nYeah sixty million dollars three new ferry slips into new passenger loading here as a very important project for the Cape and what's on\nWe're going to speak right now with ed Miller the province town bad or good morning ed good morning Steve ... province town has a special town meeting coming up tell us about what's on the agenda here\nWell yes ah October twenty ninth is the upcoming special town meeting and province town and uh\nIt seems appropriate

dealt with um including a to land acquisitions\nThe Elaine hall property on commercials street and the Dwyer property on Bradford street these are a parcels that open space committee and province town\nHas been seeking for a while a halt property involves a a a a piece of beach front that a a conservationist in town would very much like to preserve\nWelcome back this is the news around up on the point we're discussing the top local news stories of the week I'm Steve Juncker joining the from the Cape cod times is Cindy McCormick Cindy we were just speaking about the ... for a casino and what it means for the land in trust\nMeanwhile the ... tribe is suing the ... commission and this has to do with oyster awkward culture around an area that may be facing development\nYeah this is a religious concerns goose Barry Island and they in order for it in order to develop anything you have to send that I'm a lifting ... wetlands around your property and the ...\nDylan ... submitted by the owners of ... to the conservation commission did not um was was an accurate and I neglected to include a coastal dune and coastal\nBeach and tidal flats and this is all very close to the tribe shellfish hatchery and they said this is of concern to them because they're afraid they will be developed and that will impact or shellfish resources\nWho's very island has a little bit of history here of the owners wanting to develop it\nYeah they've actually wanted to they ... they wanted they ask for um\nBridge to ah they wanted to bridge built and that was turned down and then they actually want to do one a a a house built and that was also turned down and that was turned down initially because they\nThe town officials were like well there is no access how if there's a fire how how would how would firefighters get out there and so they came back with his proposal for a bridge but that was um that was also turned down\nA the tribe is concerned that if some development happens there they're all they're or Easter awkward culture as you say they're actually they're nurseries is right up against\nThat yes um and then a George ... natural resources and he says it's not just to try these he says the whole\nTown is going to suffer for house goes up on that island he says that a septic system there would not served a purpose that ... now because at least or as you know ... the water and this has been the tribe has been working with the town to improve the water quality of the ... and and water areas and and and the town of ...\nAnd the oysters themselves improving the water quality right exactly a detailed conservation commission what do they have to say about the lawsuit\nWell they say that this you know the the fact that this uh these coastal dunes and the coast of each other tidal flats weren't specifically spelled out you know won't have doesn't mean that they're not going to be reviewed and ... and any project that comes up that doesn't it doesn't mean that they're not going to consider that\nSo it wasn't really a mistake and they will be considering that the entire egos is\nRight and this is a three point five acre island ...\nWe're going to speak right now with Brian doubted the Martha's Vineyard times good morning Brian Steve going\nGoing Will Wright and you've got a story about a new program for school athletics it's called the unified sports

Kari excuse [laughter] he told me about it is a new biography or every day's extra and\n... ... ... one of the highlights that his title is I'm kind of a philosophy on life city that he got when he was serving in Vietnam about how each day that you have is an extra day and uh you know what do you do with that day and uh he's done quite a lot [noise]\nAnd uh he talked about everything from his childhood to his time Vietnam a time as a congressman and ... a a\nN during the presidential election ...\nI I you also ask them a little bit about his island life it sounds like he suffered from a condition many of us had during the summer he was working so much this past summer he didn't get as much time to spend as he would've liked doing things like sailing and being sort of enjoying his time on the island\nThis is a fire graffiti city for grows you didn't get to go out as much to some favorite vineyard places like the red cat a cardboard box and especially backdoor donors she's huge\nBrian Dowd from Martha's Vineyard times Brian thank you for joining us this morning like [noise] with me in the studio is Cindy McCormack from the Cape cod time Cindy in an advisory group met last week to take on issues around right will protection tell us about this\nYeah this meeting ended last week a week ago on friday with some suggestions that such as more temporary area closures and possible testing new technologies that will\nChange fishing gear so it causes less harm to the north Atlantic right wheels and this is according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fisheries biologists calling Coogan now um I met\nArthur Sawyer from the Massachusetts lobstermen association said that there was extremes on both ends but they're trying to work toward the fishermen are ... and and lobstermen are trying to work with a scientist toward a solution that will benefit that will\nThat both sides can agree with and they'll be meeting again in March about this\nAnd what are some of the ideas they have for how to protect large whales right whales\nOne of the ... well one of the things that you know to change the fishing gear or sell it releases there's you know they have right now they say there are about ... million vertical fishing lines connecting trapped there for his bullies and areas of the U.S and Canada our right well migrate calf and an forage for food and so this is they get entangled in scarce they're talking about you know\nUh sometimes like a\n... that the fishing with traps I Do not actually are are actually connected by vertical lines that you would find me using technology and the ... wrote the road with Louis system and also just um\nHaving temporary closures in some areas where there are ship strike for instance where they seem to be a number of ships strikes because\nThis is the right way all population is really in decline it took an unusual hit last year with a document to death of Seventeen animals and can eat in us waters\nSo far there's been two deaths this year or one of the huge issues is that what's happening to the females in this\nPopulation they are there's a there's a greater number of years between when the females get birth and there is an overall lack of tennis\nThere were zero last year and the concern is that um well the population was four hundred and fifty one and two thousand six team and that's imperative let's say two thousand ten the peak was four hundred and eighty one and it's been declining since then\nAll right that was achieved leading up to two thousand ten I'm like the three years of recovery will be lost by twenty twenty nine at the current rate of ...\nA decline continues and there are other issues that are less in the control of fishermen but they say that the um there's usually fast warming of the Gulf of Maine that was a step\nTemperamental that came out and so what's happening is that a lobsters are getting these um from this unexpected or an anticipated warmth lobsters are developing shell disease and fit a lobstermen are going farther north\nAnd that is putting them in contact with these whales more in the path of the way I wanted to pass away all\nThe wheels are looking for food and so it's like their food source is also shifting with warming waters\nYeah their food sources are are shifting and they're going into like the Gulf of St Lawrence and the females you know all the all the whales are following the food source of course but the problem as the females have off of Florida Georgia\nAnd this extra mileage actually takes a toll on them you know uses more energy so they're just not in as good shape as they would have been otherwise and they and that makes them even\nEven a healthy well could be destroyed by a fish up by a vote strike or a becoming hopelessly entangled and fishing lines but even ... but some do survive and that it's better if you're healthier and stronger whale and you're able to recover\nAnd we are talking specifically about right whales and one other thing I Want to mention that he talked about here was above the ropes that can break at a lesser a", "show_name": "The Point", "year": "2018", "city":
