well as in our homes and schools and throughout our culture and we are seeing it play out on the national scale in particular the last week or two in ways that are I think\nHighlight it for them what we saw especially I'm Down in DC this week I thought was unconscionable from some folks I can understand that a U.S senator who wants to ... his finger at America coming from a political position makes a lot of sense but what I heard was a lot of barking\nAnd a lot of pushing people back into the shadows\nAbout legitimate concerns about their own physical sexual health and the twenty first century and that it continues to happen and we're seeing some power dynamics coming out I'm right in our face where the loudest the the the folks who are going to be their heels and the deepest who are gonna\nBe the angry as those voices the siren song of those voices is going to draw folks and to be like we're going to protect\nThat person 'cause they're so strident in their ... their defense what they're defending art is legitimately eons of a power disparity between men and women that have led to situations in which women have been\nAbused and manipulated a especially in a professional workplace for a long time and we need to do more about it and if I get to become state rep I'll make sure that we do thank you\nQuestion will cracker well first of all of what's going on in Washington I don't have a lot of influence on but what I Do have a lot of influence on is what goes on in the towns of Barnes Noble in the arm is uh to that end the speaker of the house\nI'm Robert ... has has made some great strides with regard to that uh we have put together some with regard to how the house operates we have new guidelines um we have brought in some new personnel and they are going over um basically how the house operates with regard to um\nUm sex how how the the the people in the house worked with each other on a on a matter of that and how men and women work together and sometimes how they don't work together very well so\nSpeaker to Leo has put together a a task force to be able to work on that we're bringing in New people were bringing an odd but non but it's meant to be able to be the the clearing house for for these actions so I think as far as the house is concerned\nUm we're making strides there is there more we can do of course there was more we can do but in terms of what's going on in Washington\nI'm not one of the one hundred people it's going to make any kind of decision down there is far senators concerned I'm just basically concerned with what's going on in bars to bomb the arm of\nAnd working in a bipartisan manner in the house\nWith Republicans and Democrats to make sure\nEqually we are talking with ...\nCandidates for state representative and the

an email the point at Cape and islands dot org\nWill crack or you're trying to go for this time born in ... bridges come under the purview of the American Army Corps of engineers but as we know the bridges or a lifeline to the Cape and islands there has been a number of suggestions including the state taking over management of the bridges good idea\n[noise] I think it's an idea that needs to be looked at it but I figure overall but we need to do was and we have already\nBridges they were there almost a hundred years old they were built in the Nineteen thirties\nUh and they just can't accommodate the traffic that goes over them now or the roadways are ten they're ten feet across federal guidelines that they have to be twelve feet across so ... it's they are just not a capable of being able to accommodate the increasing traffic back and forth\nUm we need to look at that but as the as has been talked about before we need to start talking and we are already starting to talk about replacing them I'm as you say the Army Corps of engineers\nHandles the bridge structures themselves um the state DOT handles the roads up to them so we need to be able to work with the federal government's as I Do in the house every single day\nOught to be able to come up with some common sense solutions on this to be able to come up with ways that we can manage to traffic to the bridges as they are now but also keep in mind that we need to replace them I think you\nPop yeah yeah so to a certain ... ah extent were just having a hard time managing our popularity to a certain extent on the Cape I agree with with the state representative\nUm about a bunch of this I I ... the white knuckle experience of being in one of the two center lanes going over our two bridges at this point in time is something that I think we all know intimately and it just doesn't feel right but\nIf a structure is a challenge I think up and down the entire commonwealth and I'm not necessarily saying\nA great sense of leadership on infrastructure related issues coming out of the state house or the governor's office for that matter the infrastructure issue of what we saw with the the the gas explosion in ... valley that had been highlighted in disgust for a long period of time and we never saw any action\nI think what you suggested here representative Crocker is more talking more study and I think it's more time for more action I think\nHigh speed ferries more trains all those things need to be looked at as well and considered but we actually need to take action we haven't done anything on the spot for a long period of time and I'd not necessarily saying the leadership on infrastructure across the board we\nI mean think about just are high speed Internet access penetration up and down the Cape were not drawing and knowledge workers set into this larger environment because we can't quite get\nThe infrastructure pushed out to the deepest for this edges of this amazing peninsula so I'm should the state be more involved and for sure but at this time for more talk now it's time for action\nHim about it I think we are we are the beginning that state\nHave something that is a\nPractical and something that will work so I we do need to study this we do need to make sure that the plants that we have a that are finally put in place are practical and we'll work\nI think it looks like a John is calling from Orleans combining John what's your question for a candidate\nGoing I'd like to know if a candidate stances on safety at pilgrim nuclear plant right\nThank you ... yeah I think um [noise]\nThat pilgrim needs to have been closed yesterday I feel like they've been allowed to get out of any number of the procedure is necessary to keep our community strong and save over the last couple of years because of its trajectory towards being closed down\nWe made choices in the seventies in regards to our energy was going to be produced\nAnd we made a big fat and I'm not enthusiastic about how that that went for us we're going to be we we can talk about the zero carbon energy and all those benefits from\nNuclear and that's great but we are going to be dealing with\nForty thousand a four hundred thousand dollars four hundred thousand years' worth of of nuclear spent nuclear materials that we don't right now have a great plan um and there's a whole bunch of issues environmental justice and sending it out to the west\nAnd then there's the catastrophic storms that can happen here that could put everything are being put in dry tasks at risk a on site\nAnd so I ... my position is that um I Do think that the bipartisan commission that has been helping with the shutdown procedures has kept\nThe two entities the the owner today energy as well as I think whole tech who's going to be taking over has been holding them to task and all those groups the downwind there's and the other ones that have been really focused on corporate responsibility in this regard I thank God that they've been involved in the process I think he will clunker\nI mean I'm proud to be one of my very favorite public radio stations in America this American Life Saturday morning at eleven Sunday night

the Trump Administration has been dismantling some federal regulations like rolling back the clean Power Plan and fuel efficiency standards we have state standards for both thoughts on how and if we can keep environmental protections in place on the state level when the rules are changing on the federal level\nAgain ah it's it's a situation where I don't have a lot of influence in Washington but

about um maybe two or three three years ago and it's the blue economy are you talking about ah something that you can push\nForward and be a something that is a leader and environmental work the blue economy um you know we we're surrounded by water like you said we need to use this more efficiently to drive our economy we need to have some innovation here\nAnd by innovation I mean we need to develop and strengthen our existing innovative water based businesses eco tourism for one thing uh and and something that I Know that Paul is Paul is a very familiar with is using wasters uh thinking out of the box you use the millions of oysters that we can put in\nIn West bay and north bay and some of them and they're all ready to be able to clean up the uh clean up the the pollutants the nitrogen that's coming in there\nUm we need to get financial support to these places we need to get capital we need to get small business loans so those companies that do exist here can thrive can expand and we need to get this is an educational component as well\nI think we need to tie the blue economy into our schools are again the curriculum K. to twelve age appropriate and we also need the time that into our technical schools boat building and\nAnd all of all loose a technical jobs that that um\nHave a you know some sort of footprint in ... in our economy and our environmental economy

we're in you don't just lead just to be the first you lead to be right on stuff like this and it's great that you're talking a whale about the blue ... it's one of those things that we need to\nSocialize folks do around here\nAnd being down the street from who we NBL and in particular those are niche assets that we have that are global leaders in the monitoring exploration of the ocean where to stage now where it's clear to us that over a long period of time\nHuman beings primarily through industrial practices has re mixed the chemistry of our air and our water\nAnd it's having profound effects and will continue to and if we're not going to get national leadership if we're going to get steps away from the direction that we were headed for a long time been states do have to step up\nCoastal states on the west side of our nation have done it and we can over here as well and I'm not seeing that sort of commit to a vision about being\nSomething like over nouveau energy

seeing some power dynamics coming out I'm right in our face where the loudest\nThe of the folks who are going to it's big their heels and the deepest who are gonna be the angry as those voices the siren song of those voices is going to draw folks and to be like we're going to protect that\nPerson because they're so strident in their ... their defense what they are defending our is legitimately eons of a power disparity between men and women that have led to situations in which women have been abused and manipulated\nA long time and we need to do more about it and if I get to become state rep I'll make sure that we do thank you same question will cracker\nWell first of all of what's going on in Washington I don't have a lot of influence on but what I Do have a lot of influence on is what goes on in the towns of Barnes Noble and Yarmuth uh\nTo that end the a speaker of the house I'm Robert ... has has made some great strides with regard to that we have put together some\nWith regard to how the house operates we have new guidelines um we have brought in some new personnel and they are going over um basically how the house operates with regard to um um sects how how the the\nThe people in the house worked with each other on a on a manner of that and how men and women work together and sometimes how they don't work together very well so speaker to Leo has put together a a task force to be able to work on that\nWe're bringing in New people were bringing them out but non buds meant to be able to be the the clearing house for for these actions so I think as far as the house is concerned um we're making strides there is there more we can do of course there was more we can do but in terms\nOf what's going on in Washington I'm not one of the one hundred people are going to make any kind of decision down there as far senators concerned\nI'm just basically concerned with what's going on in bars to bomb the arm of\nAnd working in a bipartisan manner in the house\nWith Republicans and Democrats to make sure that everyone a is treated equally\nWe are talking with ...\nCandidates for state representative and the second part civil district\nEight six six

radio\nYou're listening to the point it is the first of our general election debates with us this morning we'll cracker and Paul Cusack who are running for state representative and the second Barnes Noble district if you have a question that you would like to pose to our two candidates eight six six nine nine nine for six to six or you can shoot us an email the point at Cape and islands dot org\nWill crack or you're trying to go for this time born in ... bridges come under the purview of the American Army Corps of engineers but as we know the bridges or a lifeline to the Cape and islands there has been a number of suggestions including the state taking over management of the bridges good idea\n[noise] I think it's an idea that needs to be looked at but I think the overall but we need to do is and we have already started doing it was just talking about replacing those bridges they were there almost a hundred years old they were built in the Nineteen thirties\nUh and they just can't accommodate the traffic that goes over them now uh the roadways are ten they're ten feet across federal guidelines that they have to be twelve feet across so ... it ... they are just not a capable of being able to accommodate the increasing traffic back and forth\nUm we need to look at that but I as a as has been talked about before we need to start talking and we are already starting to talk about replacing them\nUm [noise] as you say the Army Corps of engineers handles the bridge structures themselves um the state DOT handles the roads up to them so we need to be able to work with the federal government as I Do in the house every single day\nTo be able to come up with some commonsense illusions on this to be able to come up with ways that we can manage to traffic to the bridges as they are now but also keep in mind that we need to replace them I think you\nYeah so to a certain extent\nTo a certain extent on the Cape I agree with with the state representative um about a bunch of this I I Do white knuckle experience of being in one of the two center lanes going over our two bridges at this point in time to something that I think we all know intimately and it just doesn't feel right but\nInfrastructure is a challenge I think up and down the entire commonwealth and I'm not necessarily saying\nA great sense of leadership on infrastructure related issues coming out of the state house or the governor's office for that matter the infrastructure issue of what we saw with the the the gas explosion in ... valley\nThat had been highlighted in disgust for a long period of time and we never saw any action I think what you suggested here representative Crocker is more talking more study and I think it's more time for more action I think\nHigh speed ferries more trains all those things need to be looked at as well and considered but we actually need to take action we haven't done anything on this front for a long period of time and I'm not necessarily saying the leadership on the infrastructure across the board we\nI mean think about just are high speed Internet access penetration up and down the case or not drawing and knowledge workers set into this larger environment because we can't quite get the infrastructure pushed out to the deepest for this edges\nOf this amazing peninsula so I'm should the state be more involved and for sure but at the time for more talk now it's time for action to him about\nIt I think we are we are beginning stages we need to be a what we need to have something that is a\nPractical and something that will work so we do need to study this we do need to make sure that the plants that we have a ... that are finally put in place are practical and we'll work\nI think it was hard to John who's calling from Orleans combining John what's your question for a candidate\nGoing I like and do it on faith the pilgrim nuclear plant\nThank you ... yeah I think um that pilgrim needs to have been closed yesterday I feel like they've been allowed to get out of any number of the procedures necessary to keep our community strong and save over the last couple of years because of its trajectory towards being closed down\nWe made choices in the seventies in regards to our energy was going to be produced and we made a big bat and I'm not enthusiastic about how that that went for us we're going to be we we can talk about zero carbon energy and all those benefits from nuclear and that's great but we're going to be dealing with\nFour hundred thousand years' worth of of nuclear ... nuclear materials that we don't right now have a great plan um and there's a whole bunch of issues and our mental justice and sending it out to the west\nAnd then there's the catastrophic storms that can happen here that could put everything are being put in dry tasks at risk a on site\nAnd so I ... my position is that um I Do think that a bipartisan commission that has been helping with the shutdown procedures has kept\nThe two entities the the owner today energy as well as I think caltech who is going to be taking over has been holding them to task and all those groups the down winters and the other ones that have been really focused on corporate responsibility in this regard I thank God that they've been involved in the process I think it will cracker\nYou are listening to double UCA I support comes from you and

representative\nA candidates for the second partial district will cropper and Paul ... eight six six nine nine nine for six to ... if you want to get a question in before we get up to closing statements eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org will crack we start with you this time\nMassachusetts known for strong laws and environmental protections the Trump Administration has been dismantling from federal regulations like rolling back the clean Power Plan and fuel efficiency standards we have state standards for both thoughts on how and if we can keep environmental protections in place on the state level when the rules are changing on the federal level\nAh it's it's a situation where I don't have a lot of influence in Washington but we do have an influence on deacon hill and one of the things that I Would love to be able to see pushed forward and begin Helen something that I Will push forward\nOr it's something that I heard about um maybe two or three three years ago and it's the blue economy are you talking about ah something that you can push\nForward and be something that is a leader in environmental work the blue economy um you know we\nWe need to use this more efficiently to drive our economy we need to have some innovation here\nAnd by innovation I mean we need to develop and strengthen our existing innovative water based businesses eco tourism for one thing uh and and something that I Know that Paul is Paul is a very familiar with is using wasters uh thinking out of the box you use the millions of oysters that we can put in\nIn West ... in North bay and some of them and they're all ready to be able to clean up the uh clean up the pollutants the nitrogen that's coming in there um we need to get financial support to these places we need to get capital we need to get small business loans so those companies that do exist here\nCan thrive can expand and we need to get this is an educational component as well I think we need to tied the blue economy into our schools are again the curriculum K. to twelve age appropriate and we also need to turn that into our technical schools boat\nBuilding and and all of all those uh technical jobs that that um have a you know some sort of footprint in in our economy in her environmental\nEconomy we need to put that component in school says well I think the blue kind of me something that uh could be a of a pass a trailblazer that's the word I'm looking for a trail blazers as far as\nAs far as we can uh as far as we go here on Cape Cod\nThinking I concur with a lot of what the representative Crocker just sat there was a couple of things so I think the leadership at the house level this past summer\nFailed the people of Cape Cod as well as the commonwealth in regards to increasing things like the renewable portfolio standard RPGs is way under targeted at a and needs to get closer to three percent or more as well as the the bonding um that was done in this last let legislative\nA session I really feel like we're not seeing that type of leadership for the type of state that we're in you don't just lead just to be the first you need to be right on stuff like that and it's great that you're talking a well about the blue ... it's one of those things that we need to\nSocialize folks do around here\nAnd being down the street from who we NBL and in particular those are niche assets that we have that are global leaders in the monitoring exploration of the ocean where to stage now where it's\nPeriod of time human beings primarily through industrial practices has really mixed the chemistry of our air and our water\nAnd it's having profound effects and will continue to and if we're not going to get national leadership if we're going to get steps away from the direction that we're headed for a long time than states do have to step up\nCoastal states on the west side of our nation have done it and we can over here as well and I'm not seeing that sort of come to a vision about being\nSomething like over new energy exporter that I think that we really could become with the strength of our local population how smart and hardworking we are thank you\nThat's not too uh Jack who's calling from the army's good morning Jack\nYes good morning um I'd have ... question but I think are very important
