sector of the world bank\nAnd for research consultancy monitoring evaluation of a foreign aid interventions and Mozambique and southern Africa\nUm I did not think I was going to be running for office at the age of twenty seven um [noise]\nI think when we look at the political climate nationally right now\nWas that no matter what side of the fence you sit on 'em you will see that things are very very toxic right now\nAnd neighbors don't even want to talk to each other about issues of frequent consequence and our lives um with that said I see a tremendous amount of challenges and the community in which I was raised um I see the lives that a lot of folks that I grew up with most of my friends have have remained in the community\nAnd I'm I'm I'm concerned about the future of Cape Cod I'm when it comes to the challenges that are impacting the Cape whether it's transportation whether it's the environment whether it's a education funding um these are all things that unite us all and\nMy big frustration as I don't see a fifty to one hundred years strategic vision of the state level for our region on the Cape gets this perception as this wealthy vacation destination um at the state level um it's not the people who live here year round really struggle\nAnd um I think that there is definitely a case to be made for a new leadership at the state level up represent this region for the Next Fifty years so then I decided to talk about the issues ... fate thank you so much Randy hunt\nTo morning Mindy and Jack and I also think WC a yard for doing this debate [noise]\nUm I Am the state representative of the fifth burns will district and um I Want to tell you just a little bit about myself I'm I'm sixty one so you can look that up so there was a definitely an age disparity between the two of us\nUm we have a merry and I have six kids and twelve grandkids are one of whom we haven't seen her youngest son is in the air force middle ... and we have a ten week old green and some over there so we're going to get to see them on Thanksgiving\nUh what is a public health crisis I don't think I ever speaks to the fact that our current health system is not addressing this this this crisis\nI'm under a multi payer system that's very very difficult to get people access to treatment on one month of of outpatient care is is is not sufficient and so um when you look at our house system as a whole background research consulting\nI [noise] there is there there's a need to move\nCover more people and get people access to the treatment they need right now if you need help there is no number you can call to get you the treatment that you need and and quite frankly there's so much more that can be done to ensure that we have a more holistic coverage for folks so they can get access to the treatment that then\nYou didn't use your whole time so you want to give some ideas on what you would do I I Would love to start the conversation of moving Massachusetts to a single payer health system I'm it would save money and it would cover more people and it's just all about a question of resources um\nWe can cover more people at half the cost um when you look at every other industrialized country on the conversation has to start is not going to be an overnight sang but um [noise]\nYou know too many people are her and in this crisis and are not getting the help help that they need 'em by virtue of an inefficient health system\nAnd um that that wouldn't be the only crisis that a problem with that that moving to a single payer would would address but\nThat's a one area where it's\nAffected down here maybe ...\nI only want to add this that or just to correct this when there is a telephone number there is a website to connect you people or to their treatment beds\nA and you can find that on my resources page\nRandy hunt state rep dot com on that resources page there's information there a lot of it about this issue including where you can find beds including how to file a section thirty five for somebody that you need to get into treatment who may be delivered family member\nAnd exactly how to fill the form out and deal with burns or courts to make that happen\nAnd we're talking with you on that I mean so I mean there are parts of treatment that aren't even covered under mass health right now what if what if you're under insured what if you would if you don't have insurance at all um these treatments are extremely expensive I mean we're talking about you know five thousand six hundred dollars a week and in some cases and so um there's not enough beds available\nI if if you you really need help some families you know I\nHave an enormous financial burden to take care of someone that they love and the resources are not there for those who who truly need help and part of that as a failing of our health system it can be structured in a more efficient way to make sure that our health dollars are getting spent on on making people better not on\nA marketing and executive pay which is how they are spent under our current um all payer system\nTalking with the candidates running for state representative and the fifth Barnes Noble district

identify um places for most predisposed for\nYou need to do a comprehensive risk assessment to identify areas where we can work on some resiliency project improperly ... I'm In addition I think that the shift to alternative energy that we have a double need to make in order to get ourselves to lower carbon emissions trying to come off as one of the biggest economic opportunities that we had a history of our our state [noise]\nUm there's tremendous amount of money to be weighed me made made with regards to offshore wind solar we a tremendous amount of research in research institutions here in Massachusetts a tremendous amount of financial capital\nAnd I think that we could make Massachusetts a leader when it comes to a a shift Chernobyl energy I'm I live just a stone's throw from the timeline essential as possible\nUm in these most recent storms the great Marcia overflowed parts of six say er which were six feet under water um\nThese storms are only going to get more serious I think that Massachusetts so it's been a leader and when it comes to fighting climate change we need to\nBe that leader across the country I Know that we are currently leading the way nationwide by the United states is very very far behind countries like China countries like Germany who are taking advantage of this opportunity to shift to a renewable energy and aren't making a significant amounts of money off it\nOr we can do better and um I think that you know it requires great advocate the state level\nUm this region is going to be profoundly impacted and we can do more [noise] thank you waiting in\nLong term this is the biggest biggest issue that we faced I'm In any coastal area\nAnd I'm just saying that I Would point out is of the good news is we have done the assessments\nUh we've done the assess the see the end the coastal zone management has done the assessment of the most um all of the coastline and the most vulnerable areas and in this last session a which was a a bill that was signed by Charlie Baker in August early August [noise]\nAh we have a two point four billion dollar um pot of money that we're going to be able to use for handling these things going forward this is just the first round I'm about half a billion dollars of that\nIs to respond to and prepare for extreme weather sea level rise inland flooding and climate impacts and uh and that is a under the um the money will be spent because of the studies that have been done to figure out where that needs to go\nUm [noise] another half a billion dollars and this is related to\nM. E. pi the Massachusetts environmental protection agency [noise] um and they range from water quality monitoring the air quality hazardous waste clean up the restoration rivers waterways and that type of thing [noise]\nUh and then another half a billion out of this two point four is going to be money that communities and regions themselves can ask for to help with the needs that they have in their local area\nSo uh we have made giant steps and committed real money to getting started on this as far as renewable energy goes we our number one in the nation for efficiency\nA we have a wind farms that are going up we have more that are planned we have energy storage that is going to be something that will be the key for us to actually get away from carbon producing energy generation\nThat can that Randy how we start with the this time I go ahead [laughter]\nYeah I I think that uh we're not doing enough um yes we have provided an enormous amount of money for cost of his own see and that is wonderful but you know in terms of shifting our power grid needs to talk about lifting the net metering caps who can actually allow more solar and I think we need to incentivize the construction of municipal power companies\nWhich will allow a municipality has these public lands to provide a ... a an alternative energy installations which had actually lower our our rights I think when you need to provide huge incentives for a company than wind and solar to locate here on the common off\nAnd I really think we need to have I have long term strategic look at what this place is going to look

nine nine for six to six if you'd like to pose a question to the candidates that eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point\nAt Cape and islands dot org and John has sent an email question and a jacket as your turn to go first\nWhat are your future plans for infrastructure transportation as a tradesmen who works in Boston I can tell you without a doubt it needs a lot of attention to the limits Brockton bus line is not reliable enough for anyone who has a job that requires them to start at six AM which is most tradesmen jak stent\nInfrastructure were way way way behind um I think we need to identify areas where uh you know we can have a return on investment for for projects um\nTrains are definitely a big area focus for me I Want to see the Cape better suited a better connected to the rest of the state with a rail um and I think we should start a conversation about modernization of our rail system all profit come off on the tea is a mess [noise]\nUm I think we would be well suited at some point in the future to have high speed rail but could connect us from Boston to the western part of the state so there was some sense of economic mobility for folks who needed to move around the state and uh I think the infrastructure needs to be a huge priority on these are shovel ready jobs to put people back to work\nAnd uh you know it's cheaper to address infrastructure concerns now especially when interest rates are so low so I think he meant\nWell to John I'm commuting to Boston is an awful thing I Know it because when I first signed up for this job I had my office in my house as a CPA soya sauce\nThe Boston I'm part of what we need to do is expand service on the MBTA\nUm to get cars off the southeast expressway which is a misnomer obviously\nA would help and there have been some things um bantered about now I think we should pursue them to improve route three as well including the idea that we could have two lanes that are built\nIn the median of roots three that would be a north in the morning time and south in the um come home from work time\nUm and it could be ... it could be a a based on the amount of traffic that's there that would have a variable tall I think that type of thing would help take some of the pressure off of this um when ... bay has their train service set up and ready to go\nIt's going to be um probably about a supposedly an hour to our intent long minute long train ride\nAnd you have to get all the way over to ... to start at so somebody's starting a sandwich or Hyannis or someplace like that\nUm it's gonna be difficult for that commute to be cut down so I think that we need to do a lot more in the city of Boston to take cars off the road and with that it should help some of the people who are communing from farther away\nAs far as transportation to western Massachusetts or I'm On the transportation committee we had a room filled with people saying they want to see that happen and I think it's high time that we do both south coast as well as western mass a train service\nI think you'll like John is calling from ... bay the mine John\nGood morning how are you great what's your question for the candidates all my questions more pointed towards Randy\nNo no I Need I Need a question to both candidates the same question for both candidates they both have to answer it\nOh okay uh let me figure out how to work\nThis okay why don't why don't we put you on hold while you figure out how to wear this and I'll start the next question Randy hunt we start with you this time\nA and may Senate president stand Rosenberg step down after his has been accused of sexual harassment in the state house in light of the many recent stories of sexual harassment and assault both in the workplace and outside of it has the state legislature done enough to address this issue and if not what do you propose\nWe've done a lot that hasn't been in the papers as far as the house goes um and I know that stay on Rosenberg was the Senate president um but we have set up we actually\nOther people to interview candidates so that we can have a liaison person that would be the person that a person that uh a woman or a man who felt like they were being harassed work go to in and tell their story and be confident\nThat uh it would be handled in handled in a professional way I think the confidence of telling somebody about a situation like that or has not been there\nAnd that if you told your state legislator or you told somebody in HR uh people had no confidence that that would be handled in the right way\nSo the broader issue the me too movement and all of those things that we saw and even in the Kavanaugh hearings I think that's empowering for people who have had those kinds of experiences\nI think that uh the whole idea of these hotshot contracts when people leave a business or in the case of my a seat mate right next to me\nUm representative ... was a state legislative aide who left with one of those are the only way she could get paid for leaving was designed one of these do not say anything agreements\nAnd I think we should outlaw those and we've actually taken action to do that\nI think he's ... yeah I think when you look at the past year we're living in a really profound moment where you know women are actually feeling like they can step forward and that they will be heard\nUm any two moments or you know on power it a lot of people actually kind of speak their truth with regards to a sexual assault sexual violence in that sense forcing a very uncomfortable conversation that I think we need to have as a country\nUm you know represent our pump brings up a great point in terms of you know making sure that a lot of those uh hush up agreements and things at the past are outlawed um slipping kind of walk into a the twenty first century with a\nGreater sense of of inclusiveness and and understanding of each other's experiences I'm I'm really glad to to see a you know women who have been empowered to come forward and that's inspired those who have been in the shadows and with\nA you know struggle with with uh some trauma in their past to come forward and um I think it's a we're moving in in in the right direction with regards to this area so thank you All right John and does it say that your question for both candidates\nAre alright advocate\nWorth all the ... going on with the questions in a camp and this year\nNurses on question one there's a lot of\n... that's a good question go ahead Jack stand your first sure um I I support question one I was endorsed by the master's nursing association back in late June um I think that with this question there is a lot of confusion and it's being intentionally Don\nUm if you look at the no folks a lot of that money is coming from the hospital association who is spending an awful lot of money to try and confused people\nAre with regards to rent to stand on this issue um\nIf you just follow the money labor is supporting a\nA yes on one or the business community and sort of a hospital cessation of supporting one one I think that when you look at the case of California\nUh they get

Cape Cod I'm when it comes to the challenges that are impacting the Cape whether it's transportation whether it's the environment whether it's a education funding these are all things that unite us all and\nMy big frustration is I don't see a fifty to one hundred years strategic vision of the state level for our region on the kid gets this perception as this wealthy vacation destination um at the state level um it's not the people who live here year round really struggle\nAnd um I think that there is definitely a case to be made for a new leadership at the state level to help represent this region for the Next Fifty years so then I decided to talk about the issues too great thank you so much Randy hunt\nGood morning Mindy and Jack and I also think bill you see a yard for doing this debate [noise] um I Am the state representative of the fifth burns will district\nUntil you just a little bit about myself I'm I'm sixty one so you can look that up so there's a definitely an age disparity between the two of us\nUm we have a merry and I have six kids and twelve grandkids I'm One of whom we haven't seen her youngest son is in the Airforce and middle ... and we have a ten week old grandson over there so we're going to get to see them on Thanksgiving\nWith uh what is a public health crisis I don't think I speak to the fact that our current health system is not addressing this this this crisis\nI'm under a multi payer system is very very difficult to get people access to treatment on one month of of outpatient care is is is not sufficient and so um when you look at our health system as a whole background research consulting\nI there is there there's a need to move to a single payer system so we can cover more people and get people access to the treatment I Need right now if you need help there is no number you can call\nTo get you the treatment that you need and and quite frankly there's so much more that can be done to ensure that we have a more holistic coverage for folks so they get access to the treatment that then\nYou didn't use your whole time so you want to give some ideas on what you would do I I Would love to start the conversation of moving Massachusetts to a single payer health system I'm it would save money and it would cover more people and it's just all about a question of resources um\nWe can cover more people at half the cost um when you look at every other industrialized country on the conversation has to start not going to be an overnight thing but um\nYou know too many people are hurt and in this crisis and are not getting the help help that they need 'em by virtue of an inefficient health system and um that that wouldn't be the only crisis that a problem with that I'm moving to a single payer would would address but that's a\nOne area where it's\nAffected down here maybe wait a minute\nI only want to add this that or just to correct this when there is a telephone number there is a website to connect you people or to the treatment beds\nAre and you can find that on my resources page\nRandy hunt state rep dot com and that resources page there is information there a lot of it about this issue including where you can find beds including how to file a section thirty five for somebody that you need to get into treatment who may be delivered family member\nAnd exactly how to fill the form out and deal with burns will courts to make that happen\nAnd we're talking with you on that I mean so I mean there are parts of treatment aren't even covering the mass health right now I Wonder if what if you're under insured what if you would if you don't have insurance at all um these treatments are extremely expensive I mean we're talking about you know five thousand dollars a week and in some cases and so um there's not enough beds available\nI if if you you really need help some families you know I have an enormous financial burden to take care of someone that they love and the resources are not\nAnd part of it as a failing of our health system it can be structured in a more efficient way to make sure that our health dollars are getting spent on on making people better not on a marketing and executive pay which is how they're spent under our current um all payer system\nWe're talking with the candidates running for state representative in the fifth Barnes Noble district eight six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number if you have a question for the candidate our email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org we'll have more after a quick break\nImmigration authorities

uh northeastern storms not new but last spring we saw five and coastal Rouge and hit some areas hard I think in your district you thinking of tonic beach\nFuture storms predict it to be more intense and with sea level on the rise\nStill resiliency Mindy great question on climate change is one of the most frightening I issues I think we're going to face them in the next century um\nMassachusetts is a coastal state and we're going to be one of the parts of the country that's got to be most impacted and we are going to be as Cape Cod as the peninsula jutting out and say lack we're going to be one of the parts of the state that are most impacted [noise]\nUm I think we need to for starters need to do a risk assessment for the whole commonwealth to identify um places were most predisposed for about the effects of climate change and I think that we need to do a comprehensive risk assessment to identify areas where we can work on some resiliency project improperly funds them [noise]\nUm in addition I think that the shift to alternative energy that we have ... that we need to make in order to get ourselves to lower carbon emissions trying to come all this one of the biggest economic opportunities that we had a history of our our state [noise]\nUm there's a tremendous amount of money to be weighed me made made a with regards to offshore wind solar we a tremendous amount of research in research institutions here in Massachusetts a tremendous amount of financial capital\nAnd I think that we could make Massachusetts a leader when it comes to a a shift Chernobyl energy I'm I live just a stone's throw from the town Lyons sandwich and west possible\nI'm In these most recent storms the great Marcia overflowed parts of six say er which were six feet under water um\nThese storms are only going to get more serious I think that Massachusetts has always been a leader and when it comes to fighting climate change we need to\nBe that leader across the country I Know that we are currently leading the way nationwide by the United states is very very far behind countries like China countries like Germany who are taking advantage of this opportunity to shift to a renewable energy and are making a significant amounts of money off it\nOr we can do better and um I think that you know it requires great advocate the state level um this region is going to be profoundly impacted and we can do more thank you Andy ...\nLong term this is the biggest biggest issue that we faced I'm In any coastal area\nAnd I'm\nJust saying that I Would point out is of the good news is we have done the assessments\nUh we've done the assess the cesium the coastal zone management has done the assessment of the most um all of the coastline and the most vulnerable areas and in this last session a which was of a bill that was signed by Charlie Baker in August early August [noise]\nAh we have a two point four billion\nDollar a pot\nMoney that we're going to be able to use for handling\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nInland flooding and climate impacts\nAnd uh and that is under the um the money will be spent because of the studies that have been done to figure out where that needs to go um [noise] another\nHalf a billion dollars and this is related to a supporting programs of the MVP the Massachusetts environmental protection agency [noise]\nUm and they range from water quality monitoring the air quality hazardous waste clean up the restoration rivers waterways and that type of thing [noise]\nUh and then another half a billion out of his two point four is going to be money that communities and regions themselves can ask for to help with the needs that they have in their local area so uh we have made giant steps and committed real money to getting started on this\nAs far as the renewable energy goes we our number one in the nation for efficiency a we have\nA wind farms that are going up we have more that are planned we have energy storage that is going to be something that will be the key for us to actually get away from carbon producing energy generation\nThat can that Randy how we start with you this time I kind of little ... go ahead [laughter]\nYeah I I think that uh we are not doing enough um yes we have provided an enormous amount of money for customers on CNN that's wonderful but you know in terms of shifting our power grid when you talk about lifting the net metering caps who can actually allow more solar and I think we need to incentivize the construction of municipal power companies\nWhich will allow a municipality these public lands to provide I mean as an alternative energy installations which actually lower our power it's I think we need to provide huge incentives for a company than wind and solar to locate here on the common off\nAnd I really think we need to have a long term strategic look at what this place is going to look like and fifty years or if it's too pressing and I don't see enough attention at the ... I\nAh to Boston on you would allow people to access those jobs that could have the for the cost of living but um it's going to do deal with zoning that's going to transport and it's going to deal with some forward thinking with\nAh with cards to our housing policy to ensure that people can actually afford to live here in my family moved down here uh Twenty years ago at work and family can afford to

representatives and the candidates for state representative and this is Barnes Noble district they are Randy hunt and Jack Stanton eight six six nine nine nine for six to six if you'd like to pose a question to the candidates that's eight six six nine nine nine for six to six our email address is the point\nAt Cape and islands dot org and John has sent in an email question and a jacket as your turn to go first\nWhat are your future plans for infrastructure transportation as a tradesmen who works in Boston I can tell you without a doubt it needs a lot of attention to the limits Brockton bus line is not reliable enough for anyone who has a job that requires them to start at six AM which is most tradesmen jak stent\nInfrastructure were way way way behind um I think we need to identify areas where you know we can have a return on investment for for projects um\nTrains are definitely a big area focus for me I Want to see the Cape better suited a better connected to the rest of the state with rail um and I think we should start a conversation about modernization of our rail system all across the come off on the tea is a mess [noise]\nUm I think we would be well suited at some point in the future to have high speed rail that could connect us from Boston to the western part of the state so that was some sense of economic mobility for folks who needed to move around the state\nAnd uh I think the infrastructure needs to be a huge priority on these are shovel ready jobs to put people back to work and uh you know it's cheaper to address infrastructure concerns now especially when interest rates are so low\nWell John I'm commuting to Boston is an awful thing I Know it because\nWhen I first signed up for this job I had my office in my house as a CPA soy at a Thirteen step commute to work and now we go to Boston I'm part of what we need to do is expand service on the MBTA\nUm to get cars off the southeast expressway which is a misnomer obviously\nA would help and there have been some things um bantered about and I think we should pursue them to improve route three as well\nIncluding the idea that we could have two lanes that are built in the median a route three that would be a north in the morning time in south in the um come home from work time\nUm and it could be ... it could be a a based on the amount of traffic that's there that would have a variable tall I think that type of thing would help take some of the pressure off of this um when ... bay has their train service set up and ready to go\nIt's going to be um probably about a supposedly an hour hour and ... minute long train ride\nAnd you have to get all the way over to ... to start it so if somebody is starting a sandwich or Hyannis or someplace like that\nUm it's gonna be difficult for that commute to be cut down so I think that we need to do a lot more in the city of Boston to take cars off the road and with that it should help some of the people who are commuting from farther away\nAs far as transportation to western Massachusetts\nOr I'm On the transportation committee we had a room filled with people saying they want to see that happen and I think it's a high time that we do both south coast as well as western mass a train service\nI think you'll like John is calling from ... the mind John\nGood morning how are you great what's your question for the candidates all my questions more pointed towards Randy\n... no no I Need I Need a question to both candidates the same question for both candidates they both have to answer it\nOh okay uh let me figure out how to work\nOkay why don't why only put you on hold while you figure out how to wear this and I'll start the next question Randy hunt we start with you this time or it may as Senate president stand Rosenberg step down after his husband was accused of sexual harassment in the state house in light of the many recent stories of sexual harassment and assault both in the workplace and outside of it has the state legislature done enough to address this\nWe've done a lot that hasn't been in the papers as far as the house goes\nUm and I know that stand Rosenberg was the Senate president\nUm but we have set up we actually um included Martha Coakley and some other people to\nInterview candidates so that we can have a liaison person that would be the person that a person that uh a woman or a man who felt like they were being harassed at work go to in and tell their story and be confident\nThat uh it would be handled in handled in a professional way I think the confidence of telling somebody about a situation like that or has not been there\nAnd that if you told your state legislator or you told somebody in HR or people had no confidence that that would be handled in the right way\nSo the broader issue the me too movement and all of those things that we saw and even in the Kavanaugh hearings I think that's empowering for people who have had those kinds of experiences\nI think that uh the whole idea of these hotshot contracts when people leave a business or in the case of my a seat mate right next to me\nUm representative desire ugly oh was a state legislative aide who left with one of those are the only way she could get paid for leaving was designed one of these do not say anything agreements and I think we should outlaw those and we've actually taken action to do that\nI think he's jak then yeah I think when you look at the past year we're living in a really profound moment where you know women are actually feeling like they can step forward and that they will be heard\nUm any two moments or you know empowered a lot of people actually kind of speak their truth with regards to a sexual assault sexual violence and its enforcing a very uncomfortable conversation that I think we need to have as a country\nUm you know represented hunt brings up a great point in terms of you know making sure that a lot of those uh hush up agreements and things at the past are outlawed um slipping kind of walk into a the twenty first century with a\nGreater sense of of inclusiveness and understanding of each other's experiences I'm I'm really glad to see a you know women who have been empowered to come forward and that's inspired those who have been in the shadows and with\nA you know I struggled with with ah some trauma in their past to come forward and um I think it's uh\nYou All right John and does it say that that your question for both candidates [noise] I Do All right what's the average\nWorth all the ... going on with the questions in the campaign this year where do you guys spent with the nurses on question one there's a lot of confusion out\nOkay that's a good question go ahead Jack stand your first sure um I I support question one I was embarrassed by the master's nursing association back in late June um I think that with this question there is a lot of confusion and it's being intentionally done\nUm if you look at the no folks a lot of that money is coming from the hospital association who is spending an awful lot of money to try and confused people\nAre with regards to wear nurses stand on this issue\nUm if you just follow the money labor is supporting a\nA yes on one or the business community and sort of a hospital cessation of supporting got one one I think that when you look at the case of California\nUh they get a lot of sort of doom and gloom uh and uh they found that uh what they had predicted did not come to pass\nUm eighty six percent of nurses are are backing question one and the nurses who are backing question one are are nurses that work on the bedside um the legislation they tried for over Twenty years to get some form of a safe patient limits passing the legislature failed that's why we're at a ballot question right now", "show_name": "The Point", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "18"}
