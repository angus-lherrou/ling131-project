round up on the point we're discussing the top local news stories of the week I'm Steve Juncker joining me from the Cape cod times is just lane Jeff the steam ship authority unveiled the design for its new very terminal and neighbors who turned out to the meeting were not happy with what\nThey say yeah that's right this is part of a sixty million dollar construction project right here in Woods Hole Steve it's a six year project where they're going to restrict your construct all the slips and the ... at the at the very landing here\nAnd then they're going to move to what they call the land so I work part of that is a new terminal ticket office waiting room um and once again it seems like it's been a tough year for the steam ship authority but they're they're Martin's from controversy again very\nBig projects six sixty million dollar a project but that do very or the building that they're talking about now is a new ticket failed\nIt isn't it is and others public forum Tuesday night and fell in love with the architects and ants seem ship authority management to review the designed for the new building didn't go over well um I don't know if ah if anyone has is that a chance to take a look at the the ... of it but it is a two story building large to store\nWhether the current a temporary offices\nAnd would block the views of the harbor from the crane Street Bridge which is when you're coming into what's on your oversee the harbor [noise] um and that has been a big issue with some of the villagers here they also claim that the design of the building which is largely stoning glass doesn't reflect the style of New England or the village here in Woods Hole\nAnd uh one of the folks at the meeting described it as a ski lodge in Aspen [noise]\nUh and they're also him some recommendations that the vineyard haven in Hyannis steam ships terminals maternal that old I Would say within the last Fifteen Years or so are much more appropriate for\nThe designer does building they are perhaps a little more understated alarmed who said that he\nProbably a bit smaller [noise] uh and as far as the stone and glass uh components of the building the architect says those were chosen to withstand the salt air here at all it's all\nSo um this I don't think we've heard the under this I'm at but um there is going to be an additional opportunity for people to uh provide comments because they weren't recorded at this meeting and the vast people's emailed him and\nI thought that was interesting to see if you're already held a meeting to introduce this designed to the public comment but they weren't recording the comment you know that people's input at that meeting was not going into the record and seem like it was written\nDown and wasn't recorded so when the question was asked about that they said well you can certainly a sense of emails and was your concerns\nAnd some of the concerns here again about that blocking that view and wanting to know what was happening on the second floor of this building why required a second they that's right when the ticketing office and the temporary one they have now it's just a single and it was right and they said no\nPerhaps you can take the second floor off because it had this a floor to ceiling to floor glass view of the harbor and people are saying they really people waiting for the very really don't need that view because you're taking the view of Woods Hole away from Woods Hole\nAnd they also suggested possibly turning the building around Ninety degree yeah ... exactly and but the issue with that was that it would disrupt the flow of traffic and the automobile loading zones and trucks and buses [noise]\nAnd the steam ship authority thing that they've looked at this carefully and they feel like this is the best designed to or this is where they're at right now but they are taking more comment they are ... tried held a rally in a march over the weekend tell us about this\nYeah this was last Saturday and\nIs non tribal supporters and and fellow townspeople marched from great neck road near town hall to the tribal headquarters I'm pretty much cross town\nI'm from what I understand there are about a hundred and fifty to two hundred people involved in the march a reason this was held was to create some visibility for the tribe and their protest to a recent determination\nBy the department of interior the reverse the decision to place the tribes properties and three hundred and Twenty one acres here and mastery as well as up in taunton interest\nOn that happened in September seven cents than a lawsuit has been filed to challenge the decision\nLand remains owned by the tribes Steve but because it's not and trust that means that the Trump can't have full control jurisdiction over the land of course that means that construction remains halted on the plan billion dollar casino in ...\nAnd a lot of questions about whether you this land is an interest whether the tribe is eligible for that casino in the same way it had been assumed it would be earlier\nExactly exactly and you know just another issue of the tribes facing as they have a lot of opposition from some of the neighbors up there and taught and that have been filing lawsuits which was really part of them\nHow we got to the September ... decision\nAnd this particular march and rally it was also attended by members of other tribes who was actually which was interesting they were coming to show their support and feel like the decision really undermined some of the sovereignty issues for tribes across the country exactly stand if the decision stands you know there's there's a big concern in Indian country about what's happening here\nWe're going to speak right now with Josh balling at the

really well served by great print journalism in this region in just a long tradition of it and it continues so we're very lucky that way [noise] George you've got a story about one citizen who's taken it upon himself to strike a road in vineyard haven and the response by the state tell us what's happening here\nYeah so um this is Frank personnel um and he is a beach wrote resident he has been opposed to ah what's known as a shared use path um\nFor pedestrians on bicycles that the state wants to put in along the road they want to try to connect um oh bluffs and then you have and I'm so that bicycles are really big over here\nUm you know to be able to uh make that ride safely and so there there's been a project it's in the final design stages and uh he and some other people along the beach wrote object to it um mostly because of\nThe land taking that would\nBe involved um he he in particular feels like it would be more dangerous than just having a a symmetrical a road where a there would be a fog line put in\nAnd where the bikes could um could stay and also a sidewalk for pedestrians and so he took matters into his own hands put out a tape on the road where he he um measured five feet\nFor where the fog line should be and uh the states that yeah that's a no no you're not allowed to put anything within the roadway I'm Jeff might remember this I think it happened over and found that someone someone took matters into their own hands and uh yeah it's a big no no to to do that and\nYou know people were following these markings on the road wondering you know what they were and\nWhether the state had put them in\nUm Georgia fog line is it can you explain that\nYeah so a fog line is a put on the along the side of a road like the shoulder river road and it's it's meant um\nIt's a way for um motorists as especially at night to be able to see the side of a a road so that they don't veer off of it um you know there are center lines as well um but\nUm that's picked up the fog line has picked up by your headlights and reflects back then so you can see where um you know that you're not going off the road\nSo this they said that he does is in the lab and they pulled up to date with the response\nSo they pulled up the tape and um you know Frank Frank ah is saying to people look this this was a good experiment it showed 'em that a symmetrical road all work and um you know it remains to be seen how this project\nIt is going to work at work its\nWay out we have three members of the border select men I'm into the very end they all have different opinions on this one is staunchly in favor of a shared use path\nOne is opposed to it and there's a third member who hasn't made his mind up yet so [laughter] um if it's going to be interesting so um you know Frank is trying to uh\nUh gather some evidence\nTo sway that third vote or in his favor\nOr do you have another story and wanted to talk about briefly here the islands only approved medical marijuana dispensaries aiming to be cultivating a crop my early December ... Brittany battery reporter went out and took a look at this and set up and and really gives us a sense of where the process is\nYeah so um she she went out and took a look at it and um you know this is\nProbably the only time we're going to be able to get inside a Jeff froze whose putting this together told us that once um the ah dispenser e is in place\nI'm due to Massachusetts law the the actual cultivation area and a visit to Spencer itself will be off limits to a tours and things like that so it was a good glimpse behind the scenes before things\nGet get ratcheted up um but this has been a long time coming people have been waiting for it and um he's hopeful as you said uh\nBy December and then you know get it up and running and and the new year um [noise] so [noise] um for for people who need this for a medical purposes you know this is just a big step for them\nGeorge brand name from the Martha's Vineyard times and George thanks for joining us this morning [noise]\nYes thank you Steve take care\nOkay just Blaine is with me from the Cape cod times Jeff towns across the region are looking for ways to improve attendance town meeting we heard Josh falling speaking about town meeting attendance on the island thing that they didn't have enough to make a quorum to\nMake decisions on financial matters you you have a nice article in the bad times looking at ways the towns have been dealing with this issue\nYeah we do and you know town meeting season is upon us and when Josh mentioned that there were four hundred and eighty Sandy he said there were three hundred and fifty and they needed something like for example to impress them some of his own meanings open to I'm Tommy season is upon us on a\nMaster I live at it's coming up on Monday and many of them are just not well attended um so a very very small percentage of the population some some as low as one percent sea have been making decisions for entire towns here on the Cape and islands\nIn towns have been struggling this for ... with the struggling with this for a while and trying to figure out ways to encourage people out\nYeah this this is nothing new there trying to figure out how to get people they are even just to get a corpsman and you think you enter who wrote the article for us also the born is even a decrease their corn for two hundred and fifty to a hundred and twenty five people\nAnd even then back in twenty Fifteen they had to go next to in the auditorium highschool they had to go into the gym and get parents were used basketball game to come in and get to a quorum\nOf some towns are saying perhaps we can move into a Saturday maybe we'll get some more people there 'cause some of the older people can't drive and families with children or how things going on at night but you know people have plans on weekends so uh other options are towns\nAre looking at I don't think they want to go there is to perhaps move to a town council type of government like Barnes Noble has\nAnd ... or a representative town meeting like found with has which is a very interesting story that Ethan uncovered as to how that happened was right here which all back in the Nineteen thirties a lot of neighbors were very upset about someone trying to I guess I'm ...\nNow I ...

amongst the domestication of Nantucket something about it that seems like it should glow in the dark if it were in the woods and the deep shadow\nMental cutter Bobby Frasier you're listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations\nWelcome back this is the news round up on the point we're discussing the top local news\nStories of the week I'm Steve Juncker joining me from the Cape cod times is just lane jets the steam ship authority unveiled the design for its new very terminal and neighbors who turned out to the meeting were not happy with what\nYeah that's right this is part of a sixty million dollar construction project right here in Woods Hole Steve it's a six year project where they're going to restrict to reconstruct all the slips and the utilities at the at the very landing here and then they're going to move to what they call the landslide work part of that is a new terminal ticket office waiting room\nA tough year for listening ship authority but they're they're Martin's from controversy again\nVery big projects declared sixty million dollar or a project but that the ferry or the building that they're talking about now is a new ticket failed it isn't\nIt is and others a public forum Tuesday night and found that with the architects and ants seem ship authority management to review the designed for the new building\nDidn't go over well um I don't know if ah if anyone has is that a chance to take a look at the um the ... of it but it is a two story building large two story building um rate or whether the current a temporary offices\nAnd would block the views of the harbor from the ... bridge which is when you're coming into the woods hole you oversee the harbor [noise] um and that has been a big issue with some of the villagers here they also claim that the design of the building a which is largely stone in glass doesn't reflect the style of New England or the village here in Woods Hole\nAnd uh one of the folks at the meeting described it as a ski lodge in Aspen [noise]\nUh and they're all sorts of recommendations that the vineyard haven in Hyannis steam ships terminals maternal that old I Would say within the last Fifteen Years are much more appropriate for\nThe design of those building they are perhaps a little more understand a little more into his stated that he\nProbably a bit smaller [noise] uh and as far as the stone and glass uh components of the building the architect says those were chosen to withstand the salt air here at all it's all\nSo um this I don't think we've heard the end of this I'm at but um there is going to be an additional opportunity for people to uh provide comments because they weren't recorded at this meeting and the vast people's emailed him and\nI thought that was interesting to see if you're already held a meeting to introduce this designed to the public didn't hate comment but they weren't recording the comment you know that people's input at that meeting was not going into the rancor and seemed like it was written\nDown and wasn't recorded so when the question was asked about that they said well you can certainly a sense of emails and was their concerns\nAnd some of the concerns here again about that blocking to have you been wanting to know what was happening on the second floor of this building why required a second that's right when the ticketing office and the temporary one they have now it's just a single right and I said\nNo perhaps you can take a second floor off because they have this a floor to ceiling to floor glass view of the harbor and people are saying they really people waiting for the very really don't need that view because you're taking the view of Woods Hole away from Woods Hole\nThe building around Ninety degree yeah gee yeah exactly and but the issue with that was that it would\nDisrupt the flow of traffic and the automobile loading zones and trucks and buses [noise]\nAnd the theme ship authority thing that they've looked at this carefully and they feel like this is the best designed or this is where they're at right now but they are taking more comment they are ... tried held a rally in a march over the weekend tell us about this\nYeah this was last Saturday and members of the tribe as well as their supporters non tribal supporters and and fellow townspeople marched from great neck road near town hall to the tribal headquarters I'm pretty much cross town\nI'm from what I understand there about a hundred and fifty to two hundred people involved in the march a reason this was held was to create some visibility for the tribe and their protest to a recent determination\nBy the department of interior that reverse the decision twice the tribes properties and it's about three hundred and Twenty one acres here in masks be as well as up and talking and trust\nThat happened in September seven cents them a lawsuit has been filed to challenge the decision\nLand remains owned by the tribes Steve but because it's not and trust that means that the tribe can't have full control jurisdiction over the land\nOf course that means that construction remains halted on the plan billion dollar casino in ...\nAnd a lot of questions about whether this land is an interest whether the tribe is eligible for that casino in the same way it had been assumed it\nWould be early exactly exactly and you know just another issue the tribes facing has they have a lot\nOf opposition from some of the neighbors up there and taught and that have been filing lawsuits which was really part of how we got to the September ... decision\nAnd this particular march and rally it was also attended by members of other tribes who was actually which was interesting they were coming to show their support\nAnd feel like the decision really undermined some of the sovereignty issues for tribes across the country exactly fans if the decision stands yeah there's there's a big concern in Indian country about what's happening here we're going to speak right now with Josh balling at the Nantucket in choir and Mira good morning Josh good morning\nJosh special town meeting this week bringing us up to speed on what happened\nSurely they one night

airport security and tax away improvements in three million dollars and sewer work\nDidn't get voted on and that's going to have to get pushed off to\nThe future of the marijuana articles um they were overwhelmingly approved too limited to the fold recommendation by they select board\nUh that uh the number of recreational marijuana licenses be limited to twenty percent of the year round liquor licenses and that is currently to a so once that the moratorium expires there'll be allowed to open a primarily in the mid island area there to zones already set up for that\nAnd we already have one dispensary that's received out state and local approvals for both medicinal in recreational marijuana and they will get one of those licenses and it's not clear yet who might get the second one and what the criteria will be to issue that license there's a couple of other dispensary proposals currently working their way through the local and state regulatory process\nNantucket is taking notice of white sharks what's happening here\nWell most of the news ah unfortunately has been over on the on the Cape side given the or the couple of attacks that happened at the end of the summer and early

Cape cod time since ... and with us on the phone right now is George ran in from the Martha's Vineyard times\nGeorge congratulations to Martha's Vineyard times for your award from the New England newspaper and press association\nHey thanks a lot Steve and and good morning Geoff Horning George\nHey I wanted to say I'm Steve sitting at the the awards ceremony yesterday I I I was struck by ... you really know how to pick them you know you have you have a great collection of ah newspapers talking to you or each week um and Martha's Vineyard is a particularly I'm lucky to have\nBoth of Martha's Vineyard times in the ... is that so um yeah\nYeah our listeners really well served by great print journalism in this region and there's a long tradition of it and it continues so we're very lucky that way George you've got a story about one citizen who's taken it upon himself to strike a road in vineyard haven and the response by the state tell us what's happening here\nYeah so um this is Frank personnel um and he is a beach wrote resident he has been opposed to what's known as a shared use path\nUm for pedestrians on bicycles that the state wants to put in along the road they want to try to connect\nUm oh bluffs and then you have and I'm so that bicycles are really big over here um you know to be able to uh make that ride safely and so there there's been a project it's in the final design stages and\nUh he and some other people along the beach wrote object to it ah mostly because of the land taking that would be involved um he he in particular feels like it would be more dangerous than just having a a symmetrical a road where a there would be a fog line\nGood um could stay and also a sidewalk for pedestrians and so he took matters into his own hands put out a tape\nOn the road where he he um measured five feet for where the fog line should be and uh the states that yeah that's a no no you're not allowed to put anything within the roadway I'm Jeff might remember this I think it happened over and found that the well someone\nSomeone took matters into their own hands and uh yeah it's a big no no to to do that and potentially dangerous because you know people were following these markings on the road wondering you know what they were and whether the state had put them in\nUm Georgia things a fog line is it can you explain that\nYeah so far line is a put on the along the side of a road like the shoulder river road and it's it's meant um it's a way for um motorists especially at night to be able to see the side of a a road so that they don't veer off of it\nUm you know there are center lines as well um\nBut um that's picked up the fog line just picked up by your headlights and reflects back and and so you can see where um you know that you're not going off the road\nSo this they said that he is in the lab and they pulled up the ... what's the response\nSo they pulled up the tape and um you know Frank Frank ah is saying to people look this this was a good experiment it showed 'em that a symmetrical road all work\nAnd um you know it remains to be seen how this project is going to\nWork at work its way out we have three members of the border select men uh I'm In Pittsburgh and they all have different opinions on this one is staunchly in favor of a shared used path one is opposed to it and there's a third member who hasn't made his mind up yet so [laughter]\nUm it's it's gonna be interesting so um you know Frank is trying to uh\nUh gather some evidence to sway that third vote or in his favor\nGeorge you have another story and want to talk about briefly here the islands only approved medical marijuana dispensaries aiming to be cultivating a crop my early December you Brittany ... a reporter went out and took a look at this is set up and and really gives us a sense of where the process is\nYeah so um she she went out and took a look at it and um you know this is probably the ...\nWhose putting this together told us that once um the ah dispenser e is in place\nDue to Massachusetts law the the actual cultivation area and a visit dispenser itself will be off limits to a tours and things like that so it was a good clumps behind the scenes before things\nGet get ratcheted up um but this has been a long time coming people have been waiting for it and I'm hopeful as you said a to B cultivating a by December and then you know get it up and running and and the new year um [noise] so\nUm for for people who need this for a medical purposes you know this is this a big step for them\nGeorge brand name from the Martha's Vineyard
