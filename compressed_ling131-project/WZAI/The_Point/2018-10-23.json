another term in Massachusetts\nAnd I'm wants to build to a ... a high engineering standard that they would turn over those bridges to mass highway to ... take\nWe certainly wouldn't accept the bridges that we have now they were both built on a Nineteen thirty three I'm we need new bridges with wider lane set of twelve foot wide um and maybe even ... in the middle\nBut again I'm the taxpayers shouldn't bear the cost of it uh the corps of engineers should bear the cost of it and maybe we can reach that agreement with the state that the state within assume management of the bridges wants to quote built into our standards thank you Stephen ... thanks\nOr a new bridges and I'm a I agree with a represented wailing in terms of uh uh the cost being born by the uh the Army Corps and uh open to the idea of us are looking at managing those uh afterwards I'm On a larger scale I also want to make sure that the review process for bridges\nI'm an additional improvements that have been proposed I'm Around these roadways have a comprehensive review process that the public has an opportunity to engage the Army Corps in the state to make sure that ah every plan that uh that is happening um\nIs a explain understood and best for uh for the residents that uh\nUh that are using his bridge I'm On and off um and to help sustain our uh our tourism industry here um the there's the other part of that\nIs a you know I've put out a proposal to try and\nUh mitigate a little bit of the uh the bridge traffic or you know we advocate fire which is pretty successful or during the summer at a at coming down um and that's good but at a kind of a limited a limited fashion [noise] um I was working at Northeastern University for a number of years and ran into a\nFormer Governor Dukakis who teachers there and uh had met him before and he says war I you know and I said well Cape Cod and the first thing out of his mouth was what are they going to get a a train down to the Cape and I think would necessarily going to get a train down there but I Would certainly like to see us do something like\nA at ... park and ride to be able to have some type of shuttle that connects the twenty minutes away up to a\nTo Kingston so people coming and going from the Cape may have another option or in terms of gave me the Cape so I think we need to look I'm also with some more comprehensive

our at the base of the candidates this morning with this candidates running for state representative and the first principle district Timothy willing and Steven leave with if you have a question for our candidates eight six six nine nine nine for six to six\nThat's eight six six nine nine nine for six to six we ask that equals the same question to both candidates\nOur email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org and Steven Levy we start with you this time and this is a question from barb in South Dennis\nHow and if you will lead on addressing climate change it's the most urgent issue we have since there is a small window of opportunity to actually have a substantial impact thinks that question bar\nThat's fantastic question Bob I appreciate you are you putting that uh and I'm\nI've been endorsed by the Sierra Club Massachusetts and a locally by protect our Cape Cod a aquifer who I've actually specifically worked with on a on environmental issues\nUh so I'm very proud of the positions I've taken in the head of the work I've done so far uh with them with groups like a Silent Spring eight PCC a that do some fantastic presentations in terms of a\nA working or the environment here three fifty Cape Cod I'm also\nA one thing I noticed that I think is a glaring omission for the Cape delegation is that we don't have anybody on the house committee for\nA climate change and global warming so of the committees I Want to be on that is certainly a the the first thing I'm going to ask to uh to be on\nA we're past the point of being able to do baby steps in terms of dealing with environmental issues or there was a recent study that was put out by the union of Concerned Scientists that just in Massachusetts alone\nThere is approximately four billion dollars in residence\nAt risk and the next twenty five years for flooding uh so we have a significant as serious problem here I'm\nAn example of a a one specific thing on the in the state house that I'd like to uh do the uh\nThe uh the set in the house a budget a determined that the um utilities would increase use of renewables by ... percent a year for ten years and then go back down to one percent\nThe Senate had tried to get that to three percent I Would absolutely support the renewable portfolio standard being moved up to three percent each year as an example of something that we can do think you might have changed Timothy ...\nShort I'm I've been proud to\nBe working in this position to try and reduce our carbon footprint and pay attention to climate change because let's face it climate change is real um the people that are denied a climate change Israel is certainly entitled to their opinion [noise]\nUm but I Would offer for evidence when you look at what a Cape Cod suffered during these storms that we had in January and in March during those storms or rather than sit at home\nI went out to see with my own eyes I drove up to the Mac the multi age eat a agency coordination Center for our parents will county emergency management\nUp in Barnes Noble and then I drove down six say and I went to some of our north facing beaches and I saw the water pouring over at um pains creek beach in Brewster at man's landing beach in Brewster a at a grade speech in Yarmuth port I'm a Middle Way beach up in ...\nAh went up there and I saw it with my own eyes the effect of what climate change is doing so what will I Do and what have I done I was proud when I walked in my first week in the legislature while we're filing bills back in twenty Fifteen\nI spoke with my friend who's disparate or speak a pro tem a rep had had died from Somerset and she'd approach me a we have a mutual friends I walked in 'em knowing her well\nAnd she was the representative that filed the energy diversity belt that energy diversity bill has made possible what we're seeing now with offshore wind development south of the vineyard and south of Nantucket and she asked me to be a co sponsor on that bill\nAnd I worked with her to get to get that bill through and to get it passed I've since worked with the folks over vineyard when because let's face it we need to find renewable a ways to build renewable energy portfolio\nAnd I think that this is a way to do it\nUm as well as supporting the bakery administration in ...\nBack to get more Canadian hydro electricity down here so we can get the electricity we're going to need to support our citizens are business I\nThink he's the one of the metal yeah just a couple of things that there is certainly a a number of residents have other environmental concerns about the hydro electric\nA piece um and yeah it it absolutely Israel in fact our mutual friends the elements um we we know from them that uh you know two storms wiped out Seventy five for you to do that at ... at the beach and and took out a kick out there ah ah their business\nUm but I think it's important to have some leadership because we also have\nThe Republican administration in Washington dismantling environmental protections in that significantly affects them we need someone that's going to speak up to those and make sure that we're doing things I'm here and and finally in terms of environmental a focus\nYou represent a whale and if you look at the uh the ratings of mass Audubon and environmentally Massachusetts um they're the lowest in the delegation so I Hope you can improve\nOn we're going to stick with this thing for a couple of minutes [laughter] so I didn't really start with you this time [noise] when I was um do you speaking of the storms that we had we had those uh five night officers I'm so future storms again predicted to be more intense with sea level rise on the rise so how do we improve prepare and improve coastal resiliency\nWe've been working on that uh I can tell you\nFirsthand I'm myself a senator sphere and representative Crocker we'd been working on um ah the issues that they've been facing up and the blitz point section of Barnes Noble\nThat area's been facing terrible terrible floods I was just up there earlier this week and I was talking with some of the residents\nThank you Tim Whalen you know ... again you just full of great question for their mandates one after the other after the other it's been brilliant um I I think that they're going to take us back to the question that we just address which is waste water\nMore and more I talk to our employers in the first ... district and I speak to them regularly\nThe one thing that holds them back from expanding their business the one thing that hurts recruitment of new employers because again we need to\nGrow out of our seasonal economy and we value our seasonal economy it is\nIt is what it is but we need to expand our economy so we have more year round jobs available because you know where we're\nJust gonna keep running in place long as we're stuck with a seasonal economy the one thing that keeps us from getting those job creators down here in recruiting business to the K is the waste water issue I was speaking just the other day with tiny some ballots from the arm of house who told me that he just been a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to do septic a service repair\nOr at red faced jak one of the restaurants that he owns like you said to me a hundred and fifty thousand dollars that I just dumped into a hole in the ground I'm\nAnd I'm not getting any of it back I spoke with Jerry manning over captain Parker is I'm not too long ago and he was telling me that he spent over two hundred thousand dollars on septic work at it it is\nAnd when other employers start looking at that they're not going to come to the Cape we have to address the waste water issue in addition to that we also have to address the availability of a workforce housing and I'm proud that my office work\nAnd we successfully got for a million dollars from grandson incentives for sixty nine units of a affordable living space or in the arm of comments project in South Yarmuth and um my my friend Steve was mentioning earlier about the ... um I\nI fully support C.

six six nine nine nine for six to six is our number if you have a question\nAnd for six to six or shoot us an email the point at Cape and islands dot org\nAnd can you see when we start with you this time you touched on this affordable housing a perennial issue courting any creative ideas to help tackle this there is no one silver bullet that will solve this problem but what are your thoughts no there is no one single answer it but I've been doing an awful lot of work again it was mentioned earlier the Cape cod young professionals\nRyan castle and Lauren Parker over there\nAnd doing a lot of work with them on trying to expand um within the towns in the first possible district\nExpand the last ... afford accessory dwelling unit um I was just knocking on doors yesterday and Brewster and I spoke for twenty minutes with a gentleman he had built a house and he was very much in support of accessories swelling units\nAnd I said not only it's just a great wave to allow seniors to age in place and be able to afford to age in place also keep young people here on the Cape and young families on the Cape\nBut at the end of the day that strong libertarian side of me says you know what it's your property it you know your home as he castle you can do with it whenever you want\nUm so the sets dwelling unit it's been big but not a big part of this has been I Can't give enough credit for the ... to administer Asian they put an awful lot of money um ah they brought an awful lot of money to the table with a housing bond bill\nAnd I'm secretary Ashley mentioned earlier was on Cape Cod secretary ... um has been absolutely positively fantastic uh it comes down to the Cape and he listens to us as we were talking about earlier with sixty nine units and affordable housing 'em\nThat are being developed at the time it's a common site um that wouldn't have been possible were not for the for a million dollars and again that came from the state between tax incentives in state grants that we got 'em I'll tell you another thing that I'm very proud of his I'm proud of the one million dollar grant that were also able to get through secretary ashes office\nThat's going to provide housing for uh eight adults on the autism spectrum and the town a dentist says well it's the responsibility of state government to support the municipalities to support the non governmental organizations going forward in this to help tackle this crisis\nAnd I'm proud of the work that my office is done in order to achieve that goal thank you Steve and legal that same question thank you uh\nKnow we generally agree on the accessory I'd dwelling piece I was a at the last boosted planning board meeting that was discussing the proposed by law in ah in Brewster on that um I I take a bit of a difference in that\nI I'm I'm not going to say it's your house do what you want with it because we actually had a very good discussion at that meeting in order to be able to balance environmental concerns\nIt's happened in our town a versus the just let anybody do or do anything so I think we're taking a an excellent approach in uh in Brewster I'd like to see that a expanded on the uh the state level to give our cities and towns that uh that type of flexibility also\nUh and uh there's been some work on zoning changes\nUm a on a on ... that would give cities and towns more flexibility to be able to ah to build and provide a affordable housing I think that work needs to ah\nNeeds to continue um I have a very specific a proposal for folks who currently are on Cape Cod and harsh struggling with housing payments I'm here I've put forward a a proposal that\nUm if you make up to a hundred and ten percent of state median income\n'em and you're paying more than thirty percent of that income uh uh towards rent because we know won the uh uh the state a state taxes you can deduct up to three thousand but I'm saying for those folks um that we double the amount that those folks can uh conduct\nI'm On their uh their state taxes and and get some money back or you know working families [noise]\nAll right so a stimulus we start with you this time would you support single payer universal healthcare coverage absolutely [noise]\nUh [laughter] sure ah I absolutely would like to say more about that are also um\nI've heard too many stories from people\nParticularly lately I'm of the struggles they've had\nIn working between their health issue their provider and what their insurers going to\nLet them do a we know there's example after example after example throughout the world where um universal single payer approach is less expensive and more effective\nUh there's no reason why Massachusetts where we first uh implemented you a universal health can't start to move the ball forward I'm On a on that also it just logically make sense that if you having another layer of administration between you and your health care that that's not efficient\nSo we have to start working towards that senator see or had a a a bill that are that he proposed last session that would uh require a study to compare our existing healthcare costs um with what's\nSo I'm In favor of that certainly has a a a start\nThinking ... [noise] yeah I Would not be in favor that mocked me down as I Know um and I will give you a uh some some justification for the position\nThat I have we were talking during the break about my family's Irish roots and I have a lot of family and friends over in Ireland in Ireland has universal healthcare [noise] and I have a dear friend of mine and my friend ... who serves would the guy to Chicago and um the police force over in ... and ...\nLost his vision in of all things he got an amoeba infection in his eye while he was on holidays in Turkey\nWhile ... seeking treatment he went from twenty twenty perfect twenty twenty vision to being legally blind in a matter of hours\nWhat he sought help he sought a medical help to fix the issue all over Europe first he went to Dublin no luck then he went to London\nWhose commitment to double UCA eyes work on the Cape the coast and the islands is shown through their financial contributions\nPlease take the time to let our sponsors know that you've noticed and that you appreciate their ongoing support\n[noise]\nYou're listening to Ninety point one double you see a high end several you ca I H.

know me let me introduce myself but ah to people before we get into talking about the the issues of the day\nOr one of the things I've been saying along the campaign trail is a telling people I said all things being equal I probably shouldn't be here based on a my background and and growing up I was one of four boys with a single mother single mother with a high school degree so she works secretarial jobs and it was a tough\nA forest for a number of years I Lived in the projects in Boston we lived in subsidized housing\nOr I can remember going with my mother to a food programs to get a extra food um for us um you know I Know and understand how much and how important it is to get a a little bit of extra extra help\nUm after that um\nWent to a UMass Amherst a because it was before double option for us to ah ah go to it was a great opportunity to get an education and again seeing how public higher education could help and and help lift people up was ah was very important so I've seen first hand\nHow government programs and government help and family and friends\nCan joined together and ah and improve things are for people I got involved in government as soon as I was at UMass Amherst I've been elected a town meeting member in cameras in Brookline in Brewster I've been on the boost the school committee and affordable housing partnership a ...\nEach year and currently a democratic state committee member I it's my pleasure to ah to join us today and to be able to talk about the issues thank you thank you and the whale\nMindy first off let me tell you a very effective time keepers you have you have my appreciation\nBridges that we have now they were both built a Nineteen thirty three uh we need new bridges with wider lanes that are twelve foot wide um and maybe even a zipper laying in the middle\nBut again I'm the taxpayers shouldn't bear the cost of it uh the corps of engineers should bear the cost of it and maybe we can reach that agreement with the state that the state within assume management of the bridges wants to quote built into our standards thank you Stephen ...\nThanks I yeah I certainly agree on the need for a new bridges and I'm a I agree with that represented wailing in terms of uh\nUh the cost being born by the or the Army Corps and uh open to the idea of us are looking at managing those uh afterwards I'm On a larger scale I also want to make sure that the review process for bridges\nI'm an additional improvements that have been proposed I'm Around these roadways have a comprehensive review process that the public as an opportunity to engage the Army Corps and the state to make sure that ah every plan that uh that is happening um\nIs a explain understood and best for uh for the residents that uh\nUh that are using these bridge I'm On and off um and to help sustain our uh our tourism industry here\nUm the uh the the other part of that is a you know I've put out a proposal to try and\nUh mitigate a little bit of the ... the British traffic or you know we have the Cape fire which is pretty successful uh during the summer at a at coming down\nUm and yeah that's good but at a kind of a limited a limited fashion [noise]\nUm I was working at Northeastern University for a number of years and ran into a\nFormer Governor Dukakis suit teachers there and uh had met him before and he says war I you know and I said well Cape Cod in the first thing out of his mouth is what are they going to get a a train down to the Cape and I think would necessarily going to get a train down there but I Would certainly like to see us do something like\nA at ... park and ride to be able to have some type of shuttle that connects the twenty minutes away up to a to Kingston so people coming and going from the Cape may have another option in terms of gave me the Cape so I think we need to look a mosque with some more comprehensive solutions on transportation\nI think you we are talking with the candidates running for state representative and the first Barnes ... district Timothy willing and Steven liberal let's we'll talk more after a quick break [noise]\nSupportive for seniors helps WBAI deliver quality NPR

listening to the Cape and islands NPR's [noise]\nYou're listening to the point we are continuing our debates with the candidates this morning with the candidates running for state representative and the first principle district Timothy willing and Steven leave with if you have a question for our candidates eight six six nine nine nine for six to six that's eight six six nine nine nine for six to six we ask that you know as the same question to both candidates\nOur email address is the point at Cape and islands dot org and Steven Levy which we start with you this time and this is a question from barb in South Dennis\nHow and if you will lead on addressing climate change it's the most urgent issue we have since there is a small window of opportunity to actually have a substantial\nImpact thanks for the question bar that's fantastic question Bob I appreciate you are you putting that are in um\nI've been endorsed by the Sierra Club Massachusetts and locally by protect our Cape Cod a aquifer who I've actually specifically worked with on a on environmental issues\nUh so I'm very proud of the positions I've taken in the in the works I've done so far uh with them with groups like a Silent Spring PCC uh do some fantastic presentations in terms of a\nA working with the environment here three fifty Cape Cod I'm also a one thing I noticed that I think is a glaring omission for the kicked delegation is that we don't have anybody in the house committee\nWarming so the committee's I Want to be on that is certainly a the the first than going to ask to uh to be on a we're past the point of being able to do baby steps in terms of dealing with environmental issues uh there was a recent study that was put out by the union of Concerned Scientists that just in Massachusetts alone\nThere is approximately four billion dollars in residential properties along the coast that are at risk and the next twenty five years for flooding\nUh so we have a significant and serious problem here I'm\nAn example of a a one specific thing on the in the state house that I'd like to uh do the uh the uh the set in the house a budget a determined that the\nUm utilities would increase use of renewables by two percent a year for ten years and then go back down to one percent the Senate had tried to get that to three percent I Would absolutely support the renewable portfolio standard being moved up to three percent each year as an example of something that we can do\nThinking language Timothy willing [noise] sure I'm I've been proud to be working in this position to try and reduce our carbon footprint and pay attention to climate change because let's face it climate change is real um the people that are denied a climate change Israel is certainly entitled to their opinion [noise]\nUm but I Would offer for evidence when you look at what a Cape Cod suffered during these storms that we had in January and in March during those storms or rather than sit at home I went out to see with my own eyes I drove up\nTo the Mac the multi age eat a agency coordination Center for our parents will county emergency management\nUp in Barnes Noble and then I drove down six say and I went to some of our north facing beaches and I saw the water pouring over at um pains creek beach in Brewster at man's landing beach in Brewster a at a grave speech and Yarmuth port I'm a Middle Way beach up in ...\nAh went up there and I saw with my own eyes the effect of what climate change is doing so\nWhat will I Do and what have I done I was proud when I walked in my first week in the legislature while we're filing bills back in twenty Fifteen\nI spoke with my friend who's disparate or speak approached him a rep had had died from Somerset and she'd approached me a we have a mutual friends I walked in 'em knowing her well and she was the representative that filed the energy diversity belt that energy diversity bill has made possible what we're seeing\nAnd south of Nantucket and she asked me to be a co sponsor on that bill and I worked with her to get to get that bill through and to get it passed since worked with the folks over vineyard when because let's face it we need to find renewable a ways to build renewable energy portfolio\nAnd I think that this is a way to do it um as well as supporting the bakery administration in their efforts to work with hydro a comeback\nTo get more Canadian hydro electricity down here so we can get the electricity we're going to need to support a our citizens and our business I think he's\nThe one of them yeah just a couple of things that there is certainly a a number of residents have other environmental concerns about the hydro electric\nA piece um and yeah it it absolutely Israel in fact our mutual friends the elements um we we know from them that uh you know two storms wiped out Seventy five for you to do that at a at the beach and and took out a kick out there ah ah their business\nUm but I think it's important to have some leadership because we also have\nThe Republican administration in Washington dismantling environmental protections in that significantly affect some we need someone that's going to speak up to those and make sure that we're doing things I'm here and and finally in terms of environmental a focus\nYou represent a whale and if you look at the uh the ratings of mass Audubon and environmentally Massachusetts\nUm the lowest in the delegation so I Hope you can improve\nOn we're going to stick with this thing for a couple of minutes [laughter] so I can let me start with you this time [noise] when I was um do you speaking of the storms that we had we had those uh five night officers I'm so future storms again predicted to be more intense with sea level rise on the rise so how do we improve I prepare and improve coastal resiliency\nBeen working on that uh I can tell you\nFirsthand I'm myself a senator sphere and representative crock and we've been working on um\nAh the issues that they've been facing up in the ... point section of Barnes Noble that area's been facing terrible terrible floods I was just up there earlier this week and I was talking with some of the residents\nThank you Tim Whalen you know ... ... again you just full of great question for their Mandiant one after the other after the other it's been brilliant um I I think that would take us back to the question that we just address which is waste water\nMore and more I talk to our employers in the first ... district and I speak to them regularly the one thing that holds them back from expanding their business the one thing that hurts recruitment of new employers because again we need to\nGrow out of our seasonal economy I mean we value our seasonal economy it is it is what it is but we need to expand our economy so we have more year round jobs available because you know where we're\nJust going to keep running in place long as we're stuck with a seasonal economy but one thing that keeps us from getting those job creators down here in recruiting business to the kid is the waste water issue I was a speaking just the other day with ...\nIt's been a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to do septic a service repair or at red faced ... one of the restaurants that he owns like you said to me a hundred and fifty thousand dollars but I just dumped into a hole in the ground I'm\nAnd I'm not getting any of it back I spoke with Jerry manning over captain Parker is I'm not too long ago and he was telling me that he spent over two hundred thousand dollars on septic work at it in his restaurant that's money that you're not going to get back and when other employers start looking at that they're not going to come to the case we have\nTo address the waste water issue in addition to that we also have to address the availability of a workforce housing and I'm proud that my office work\nAnd we successfully got for a million dollars from grandson incentives for sixty nine units of a affordable living space or in the arm of comments project in South Yarmuth and um my my friend Steve was mentioning earlier about the ... um I\nI fully support C. C. Y. P. and all the efforts that they have going forward um Secretary Ash was just down here on the Cape yesterday and ah I I received a nice email today from Lauren ... see why pi today my office for the advocacy that we put forward to help them get a hundred thousand dollars for their for all initiative thank you\nWe are talking with the candidates running for state representative in the first ... district more after a break\nI many times most of the plane coming up tomorrow our series of debates continues this time with the debate held it found that high school sponsored by the sound that

is our number if you have a question eight six six nine nine nine for six to six or shoot us an email the point at Cape and islands dot org\nAnd Timothy women we start with you this time you touched on this affordable housing a perennial issue courting any creative ideas to help tackle this there is no one silver bullet that will solve this problem but what are your thoughts\nThere is no one single answer it but I've been doing an awful lot of work again that was mentioned earlier the Cape cod young professionals Ryan castle and Lauren Parker over there\nAnd doing a lot of work with them on trying to expand um within the towns in the first possible district\nExpand the last ... afford accessory dwelling unit um I was just knocking on doors yesterday and Brewster and I spoke for twenty minutes with a gentleman he had built a house and he was very much in support of accessories swelling units and I said not only is just a great way to allow seniors to age in place and be able to afford to age in place also\nKeep young people here on the Cape and young families on the Cape but at the end of the day that strong libertarian side of me says you know what it's your property at home as he castle you can do with it whatever you want\nUm so the accessory dwelling unit it's been big but not a big part of this has been I Can't give enough credit for the ... to administrators and they put an\nAwful lot of money um ah they brought an awful lot of money to the table with a housing bond bill and I'm secretary Ashley mentioned earlier was on Cape Cod secretary ... um has been absolutely positively fantastic uh it comes down to the Cape and he listens to us\nAs we were talking about earlier with sixty nine units and affordable housing 'em that are being developed at the arm is a common site\nUm that wouldn't have been possible were not for the for a million dollars and again that came from the state between tax incentive in state grants that we got\n'em I'll tell you another thing that I'm very proud of us I'm proud of the one million dollar grant that we're also able to get through secretary ashes office that's going to provide housing for uh eight\nAdults on the autism spectrum and the town a dentist says well it's the responsibility of state government to support the municipalities to support the non governmental organizations going forward in this to help tackle this crisis and I'm proud of the work that my office is done in order to achieve that goal\nThank you Steve label that same question thank you uh you know we\nI was a ... at the last boosted planning board meeting that was discussing the proposed by law in uh in Brewster on that um I I take a bit of a difference in that\nI I'm I'm not going to say it's your house do what you want with it because we actually had a very good discussion at that meeting in order to be able to balance environmental concerns as to ah as to where things happen in our town\nA versus the just let anybody do or do anything so I think we're taking a an excellent approach in uh in Brewster I'd like to see that a expanded on the uh the state level to give our cities and towns that uh that type of flexibility also\nUh and uh there's been some work on zoning changes\nUm a on a on ... that would give cities and towns more flexibility to be able to uh to build and provide a affordable housing I think that work needs to ah\nNeeds to continue um I have a very specific a proposal for folks who currently are on Cape Cod and ours struggling with housing payments I'm here I put forward a a proposal that\nUm if you make up to a hundred and ten percent of state median income\n'em and you're paying more than thirty percent of that income or a towards rent 'cause we know on the uh uh the state a state taxes you can deduct up to three thousand\nBut I'm saying for those folks um that we double the amount that those folks can uh conduct I'm On their uh their state taxes and and get some money back or you know working families\nAll right so a stimulus we start with you this time would you support single payer universal healthcare coverage absolutely [noise]\nI'm more of a [laughter] sure ah I absolutely would like to say more about that are also um\nI've heard too many stories from people particularly\nLately I'm of the struggles they've had\nIn working between their health issue their provider and what their insurers going to let them do a we know there's example\nAfter example after example throughout the world where um universal single payer approach is less expensive and more effective uh there's no reason why Massachusetts where we first uh implemented you a universal health can't start to move a the ball forward I'm On a on that\nThat if you have another layer of administration between you and your health care that that's not efficient\nSo we have to start work towards that senator see or had a a a a bill that uh that he proposed last session that would require a study to compare our existing healthcare costs um with what single payer or would do so I'm In favor of that certainly has a a start\nThinking ... [noise] yeah I Would not be in favor that mocked me down as I Know um and I will give you a uh some some justification for the position\nThat I have we were talking during the break about my family's Irish roots and I have a lot of family and friends over in Ireland and Ireland has universal healthcare [noise] and I have a dear friend of mine and my friend ... who served with the guy to Chicago and I'm a police force over in ... and ...\nLost his vision in of all things he got an amoeba infection in his eye while he was on holidays in Turkey\nWhile ... seeking treatment he went from twenty twenty perfect twenty twenty vision to being legally blind in a matter of hours\nWhat he sought help he sought a medical help to fix the issue all over Europe first he went to Dublin no luck then he went to London", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Point", "city": "Brewster", "day": "23"}
