listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations\nThis is living lab radio I'm Heather Goldstone on the heels of the un climate report released last weekend hurricane Michael rekindled the conversation about hurricanes and climate change transforming in two days from a tropical storm to the strongest hurricane to hit Florida since Eighteen fifty one\nNow there's no question that such rapid intensification is fed by warmer ocean temperatures\nAnd that the ocean is warmer now and will continue to get warmer as a result of our greenhouse gas emissions but there is some debate about when and how to discuss those connections is it inappropriate to explore the root causes of an extreme weather event in the midst of an emergency\nA new poll of those hit hardest by Hurricane Florence suggest the answer is no forty four percent of North Carolina residents surveyed after Florence hit so they think the time to talk about climate change is as an extreme weather event is unfolding\nIt's not a majority but the number who said we should wait until a week or more after it was in the single digits ed ... is a university professor at George Mason university Center for climate change communication and one of the lead researcher on that poll at welcome to the show\nYour way to strike while the iron is hot a Hurricane Florence hits and by the end of September you're already out there running a poll of North Carolina residents I was was this by phone you have any idea of the circumstances of the people you were talking to in this poll\nIt was not bipolar we cook survey on the Web so we have some people in the email is ... and the note to answer your question we really don't know ... you know to what degree people we're still dealing with with flooding her water in their own system but\nUm we were delighted that so many people were interested in responding to our surveys so shortly after they had experience the trauma\nAnd how many residents did you actually survey\nWas like seven hundred and thirty four so\nMost of those who responded a interestingly is for me as a member of the media thought the media had done a good job covering Florence that's not something we always hear\n'em but the number who shot that climate change played a role in how damaging the storm was ah was much lower the number who thought that climate change was affecting them personally was much lower and we often think of these extreme weather events as\nCreating a boost in a people connecting the dots between climate change and extreme weather and how personal the impacts might be so what do you read into that result\nThing about extreme weather events is that they hurt people but uh they don't necessarily teach people so you get a Florence in your community and the and it's terribly punishing but you don't necessarily have any way of connecting the dots to that experience and what if anything you know about global climate change\nSo if it really is a human function to do that teaching because the the storms itself for the extreme weather events themselves don't do it for you\nUm we know that the Americans the majority of Americans do understand our climate is changing\nUm most of them the climate changes distance from them however they see it as happening somewhere someplace else maybe not even at our country um at some point in the future certainly not now and I'm mostly harming plans banquets in polar bears not people\nSo extreme weather events do actually create an opportunity to teach Americans people in North Carolina in this instance about the connection between something that just happened to them or something that is currently happening to them or to other members of their uh their community\nAnd um and to provide the context as to\nYou know why is this happening and is this happening is is more likely to be happening as a result of a you know this this abstract thing we called global climate change\nWell anytime you're trying to teach or or inform people it's good to understand how where they're starting from and North Carolina I'm\nYou know I think in in not for those of us not living in North Carolina has a bit of a reputation as maybe not being not welcoming to climate science you know we heard stories I'm In the past few years about\nAttempts to pass laws that would restrict how climate change can be talked about are considered in um you know state regulatory in legislative processes give us some more facts\nThese residents of North Carolina actually tell you um they thought and knew about climate change\nWill a majority of them I'm actually are worried about climate change a majority believe that uh you know this is a the the the storm was affected by climate change was made worse by climate change in other words more rain fell as a result\nUm but North Carolina is pretty much like any other state in in the nation\nIn the sense that we've got\nPeople who will diverse opinions and uh you know much of that diversity is regrettably it's it's determined to based on people's partisan status so\nDemocrats tend to see it in one way and Republicans tend to see it in another way\nThe fact that the north Carolina skews a little bit to the red side of the the the aisle um does tend to suggest that most north Carolinians are less likely than ah than the average American to accept the ... the reality of human caused climate change\nBut it did it in even in North Carolina that is not a majority view\nTastes so it's it's really important to understand the um the most north Carolinians in fact do understand the human caused climate change is happening\nI'm Talking with ed ... back of George Mason university at that climate change communication researcher\nAnd let's talk about that issue of climate change communication how best to talk about the connections and this opportunity to to teacher learn through extreme weather about climate change one of the questions\nHas been when is the best time to do that and just a few weeks ago as Hurricane Florence was about to hit 'em we spoke with someone from capital weather gang from the Washington Post's out whether blog and they said yeah well you know\nWe've touched on the climate change connection but that won't really be part of our\nAftermath and redux after the emergency is over and I think that's been a kind of common view um but in fact when you ask people when does the best time to highlight these connections they said during the event I mean ... they didn't think that was an inappropriate time to talk about this at all\nTo thrive and and we have to also differentiate the fact that\nAn event like this is truly a an emergency and a tragedy for the people who are in the middle of it for the rest of it for the rest of awesome that would be you know for the vast majority of Americans were incredibly interested in what is happening to her brothers and sisters in North Carolina at that moment\nSouth Carolina now that Mike is rolling his way of of ah through South Carolina at the moment we're we're interested and more over your colleagues in the media you're interested as well so when the right time to teach people about the context of why a particularly extreme event occurred\nIs absolutely when that event is occurring it might not be the best time to to speak to people in the middle of the events but the majority of us who are interested we aren't in the middle of the event so I Would actually say that the the six out of ten north Carolinians who said that you have the media should be covering this connection\nI'm either during the event or shortly thereafter I I agree with them completely and the the fact that they so shortly after Florence that six out of ten of them said that yeah that's actually relevant information to us\nIn real time or shortly thereafter [noise] to me that was the surprising part of our study we thought that people who have so recently suffered a shock as they did\nWould would be unlikely to feel that way so the fact that they were pretty clear in saying the majority of them were clear in saying yeah we we think this is relevant information and bring bring it on that that's an important fine\nI mean it was interesting looking you know gave people obviously a range from uh the best time to talk about it is as things are unfolding to\nA couple of days a week a month you know even later after the event or not at all and\nThere weren't many people he said you know wait a week wait a month wait a little bit longer they either thought for the most part you should be talking about it as it's going on maybe you know in the couple of days afterward as well while people still have their attention\nOn that story um and otherwise the only you know really solid group of people were those who were just saying we should never discuss these connections at all it was kind of either one extreme or the other in terms of when people thought was the right time to talk about climate change and extreme weather\nAbsolutely so right now in Providence and the Atlantic large ... production team is meeting and Mickey ... aren't covered under the large we all category but the humpback whales and write whales that are experiencing\nAlso unusual mortality event are I'm being discussed and policy decisions are being discussed to see what I'm rulemaking might be most effective moving forward um\nTo evaluate different options about how we can\nMinimize our impact on these animals\nAnd what might those kinds of steps look like\nStill not sure yet I'm discussions have been going on all week so they may be different regulations\nOn fishing activity in certain areas or Satan gear tight or um its use of different areas that we know that whales in Wales co occur with human activities so in the past\nHow about the different types of lines or certain areas being closed for fishing when right wells are known to be present but we're not sure what will come out of these next couple of months in the take reduction team meetings\nWhen you have an unusual mortality event like this um\nI mean in the case of the north Atlantic right whales it appears as you said to be interactions with humans Ghost Ship strikes and and entanglements things that we have a lot of control over whether or not they happen\nBut especially with a situation like the ... where we don't even know what the cause is is this something that you expect to\nEnd sometime in the next few months or in the next year is it something you expect to go on open ended Li do we have any idea\nI don't think we know yet I think um as\nAs we continue to learn more about what the specific causes of deaths are will be able to gas\nOr take a better explanation is when it might be over if it is a disease related there's a chance that that'll Peter out on its own uh but if it is mostly caused by human interaction will need to look at how we can minimize those facts and be proactive and that\nI mean I guess a lot of times and the climate change conversation we hear the phrase a new normal is there a chance that this is just the new normal for large whales along the Atlantic coast\nI certainly hope not I'm I there are certain criteria that can be not to close down in a uh unusual mortality event and we will keep working towards that so whatever we can do to make sure that this this and we'll see what we can do\n...
