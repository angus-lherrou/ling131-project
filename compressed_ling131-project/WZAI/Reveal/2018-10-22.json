Georgia cancels voters who don't turn out in multiple elections and then in some places blacks are being pulled off the rules at a disproportionate rates\nSo you registered to vote in two thousand and eight do you remember that Obama is running do you remember a hand in my mind\nYou know the ... are there and\nSo then uh last July you were taken off the voter lists are so I'd have been on July twenty eighth of twenty Seventeen um but you didn't get any notification that you\nHear the news from this you know\nDid you know there there is a policy that they take us if you don't vote\nYou\nMiss

happened to her to Rome and she she ...\nShe says it just confirms his view that voter suppression is happening\nIt almost gives people the the mindset that this is a privilege not a right and so now

states where you have the same day registration it leads to irrational voting\nBrian Robin ... is a Republican strategist I meet him in the marble halls of Georgia State house\nBrands he's voting as a right and a privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is a right period Brian sings registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree or who knows what the issues are and while the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's that administrative headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate abet a how to how does it distorted the electorate [noise]\nI don't know how you describe it frankly I'm at a loss on on that but if you don't know an October the first so there's a presidential election or a gubernatorial election in uh the first two weeks of November you're not an informed voter\nBrian argues purging people for not voting isn't taking anything from them because they're not voters\nLike if if the presidential election and in fact two presidential elections don't get you out I don't know what it's going to take to get you out and I don't care what color you are what your partisanship is I think that's a fair standard\nBrian looks at the governor's race like this it's all about who shows up at the polls camped wins if the racial breakdown of voters stays about where it's been in recent elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really tough\nYou have to polarized angry tribes going at each of you look at the falling today\n\nThat story from Johnny Kauffman of public radio station W. A. B. E. and Angela ... poodle from a piano report [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] when it comes to voting something else distinguishes Georgia for most other states it's voting machines are easy targets for computer hackers was what you were doing here even\nTechnically hacking no I Would not counted attacking now what was it that it was it was browsing the Web site that's coming up next on reveal\nAnd\n\n\nFrom the center for investigative reporting in P. R. ex this is revealed an outlet up till now we've been talking about all the\nBarriers to prevent people from stepping into a voting booth on election day like getting to the polling station in finding out your name is on the list\nBut even if you get into the booth your vote might not be properly County Georgia is one in five states that rely solely on\nTouch screen voting machines with no paper audit trail cyber experts warned about these machines for years and recently so as President Trump\nOf the things we're learning is it's always good it's\nBackup system of voting it's called paper not\nHighly complex computers paper\nThis a real cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted twelve Russian agents forced to target county Web sites in Georgia a lot of security experts are worried that when it comes to hack in Georgia is one of the most vulnerable states in the country\nBut are the people in charge of election they're actually listen [noise] reveals by a Dunkin' picks up the story [noise]\nYeah yeah so right now I'm In the machine and moving lamb has a voting machine in his living room [noise] this is what one looks like on the inside so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta his specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines she has is the kind of Georgia uses edits polling places the machine it's bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between the Nintendo and the Bible\nLogan boots it up so it was actually touch ... glitter and then it's the can pressing the image is one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that full time at the beginning and use that as a ring time\nThis is a direct recording electronic machine or ... it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cybersecurity tight that's a major red flag\nIn fact dear he's had been criticized by technologist basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines as paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing start using them again like last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security\nRon Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nYou wanted to get her official position on electronic voting machines\nShe also said that even the Logan findings for troubling they're different from a problem with the voting machines themselves\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different secured systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly met Bernhardt is a PHD student at the University of Michigan he studied the arteries and their vulnerability [noise] not says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leaves\nSo really you can inject information or inject that\nDo any part of the street the way it is set up is that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the tree\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly\nGeorgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day you at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable one of them even hacked voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side where can people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic wind for the midterm elections\nJudging Amy Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state [noise]\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's taste in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system\nBy the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none of that hacking she wrote is here to stay in quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they didn't mean as paranoia the research based findings of national cyber security engineers an expert\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with the vulnerable systems the machines that very few people trust\nKennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does the people I talked to said that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight teams\nAnd it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg has ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that we know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question\nLet me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to death [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned\n[noise]\nReveals buy duck you brought us that story [noise]\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp established a commission to look at options for replacing the curve voting system by twenty twenty\nOh in the other four states heading into the midterms they used to touch screen machines with no paper audit trail or New Jersey Delaware South Carolina in Louisiana [noise]\n\nFear of voter fraud is driving a lot of experts to restrict access to voting around the country where the where is that fear coming from that's next on reveal\nFrom the center for investigative reporting P. R. N. [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nMm\n\nFrom the center for investigative reporting in P. R. ... this is revealed I'm outlets today we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud\nPeople are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been saying\nThat many places like California the same person votes many times you've probably heard about that they always like to say oh that's a conspiracy theory not a conspiracy theory fuss millions and millions of people those claims\nHad been totally the book but one of the people who got those theories going was a Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach he's the Kansas secretary of state\nWe'd be off is he's a household name in his home state even used to have a weekly radio show\n[laughter] the worst nightmare as far as you keep them from making\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning Trump appointed him to run his so called election integrity commission it was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything\nBig you will with Casey you are in Kansas City has been covering Kobach for years it begging hey yeah so Kobach is from a small state population wise but he has his big national profile in conservative circles how did that happen\nSo Kobach is a longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people and question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that's dating back to about\nTwenty ten and since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who back to that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty\nLaw Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native his movement since then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud Kobach claims that illegal aliens that's attorney loves to use our voting\nIn great numbers and this fraud could be swinging elections\nBut way we know that that is not true\nThat is right now I could drew a bunch of the little zeroes in percentages at you here but according to the Brennan Center for justice\nIt would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate and how their voter but that doesn't stop Kobach he's a leader in the fight against this\nWell it's a major problem\n[noise]\nYou interview Kobach with them or what was the looking person well\nKnow come what makes a really good politician he's good looking he's charming he's really articulate but as a reporter he is also just maddening\nHe will tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight chew on every ... and said it would be ... ... ... if you're using the term off line as an actor\nAnd it's not off line then you will throw all these studies and statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he's still uses them\nIs arguing with your high school debate coach\nYou know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument\nAnd I think he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degree from Harvard Yale University of Oxford and then he also has this other big help it's a tool called the interstate cross check system\nIt's a massive voter tracking program under Kobach it grew to include more than half of the total voter registrations in the U. S.\nOkay so how does this thing work\nSo about two dozen states are enrolled in this cross check program it's free they share information between states\nKeeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicated voter registrations and most often this happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California did you call the secretary of state in Florida\n[laughter] no I did not that's okay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not illegal to be registered to vote in two states that said it is illegal to vote in the same election into different stage", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Reveal", "city": "Brewster", "day": "22"}
