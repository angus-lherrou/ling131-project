mentioned I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nIf any first shot a third time be convicted of any crime\nYou should be considered as I'm it's just a and B imprisoned at a labor for life\nThrough this whole story I I've been thinking about how race is connected to all of this and and that line unfit for society I mean it it just sounds like something right out of the races handbook right\nYeah I I talked to a historian about that John barred studies the history of incarceration in Louisiana at Tulane University\nNew Orleans public defender Lauren Anderson sees this every day\nIs a client has for example of civil battery charge which semester manner\nBut there was some kind of object he's done that we've been told you know well if they don't do it over here it might go across the street and aggravated battery so they'd be looking at twenty to life on it versus dessert a six month you're saying that they would change the charge so that they could then in front of the multiple bell correct exactly\nAnd there was no record of this none it's behind the scenes part of verbal ... negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys\nAnd remember in these cases the d._a. never officially charges the habitual offender statute his prosecutors just say they will if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just ...\nEven know how many

refused to be interviewed for this story\nWhich is frustrating because he's an elected official but he did offer a statement about princes case here a few parts that stood out to me Mr

then Kennedy said my hope is that Mr Albert will apply himself toward programs by which to better himself\nAnd eradicate his substance abuse issues while in prison\n\nAfter I requested to interview prance he was moved from one jail to another to begin a drug program I asked him if this was the first time in his seven years locked up that he'd been in a program to treat his addiction our
