I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know and tireless what they were trying to do for first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um there's a lot of conversation about Russian interference in the election and two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is\nTax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchased a political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things or if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nOr we saw then targeting a voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there\nDistrict databases are the rules that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were a phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which ah manufacturers e pull books was attacked but I think\nUm [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\n[noise] what was that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case or is it something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there are there's a company the our systems might actually I think they may still [laughter]\nThey may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to attack them I'm ... and again they manufacture pull books and and a deal with registration databases\nOr electronic publics or what you kind of what our use their off in a a tablets or or or or computers that are used to check people in\nUm [noise] and uh uh as I said I last I checked I think they have they they may have denied that they were actually successfully breached but at least in one of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was\nSome dinner and it sounded like them uh that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromise [noise] well\nUm [noise] ah well that's actually quite a controversial question and ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped 'em um and making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um\nPerhaps to influence the the elections ranging from um affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what\nCan be done to hack into have machines systems um the first um distinction we would make is between you know voter registration systems which I'm wary was just talking about um you alluded to at the Twenty one states\nUm they got attacked the voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines\nHum or potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan on paper ballots and\nIf we're thinking about the voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to the DEF CON um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time\nAnd the vulnerabilities are well known\nThat um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine\nAnd do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access\nThat in order to have a actually ineffective attack on them\nUm you would need some sort of inside job um that would require 'em a lot of attention to particular machines and we'll be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing is it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of\nBrute force attack against the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials do\nOur they right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is\nI'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that um the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't\nHave any sort of paper record of the election being there in that position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we're doing\nIt's made but a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could I think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but\nWouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and they weren't mistakes and the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of uh thinking that the machines right now for twenty eight keen are well taken care of\nAnd are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks\nThat we see at DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the state's the moving directions to make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nTrue I I if I could just jump in real ... point um I I\nI I think there to to build on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but um [noise] more importantly there's there there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and an example of that my an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nUm and that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly\nUm that comes up on on websites and gets reported out and uh we we have seen in fact not in the United states or that I Know of but in other countries on election night reporting attacks\nUm and um if if you get it incorrect numbers they're in an environment that we have today the hyper partisan environment where there is\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen\nHundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change in signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts\nThe more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages in and more powerful storms and to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point the agreement to ask countries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius but how much does happen to Greece save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the IPC see this week cash shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years\nIs that to Kelly the Vin she is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much to be with you\nI Want to send out a shout out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel toward a one and a half degree increase in global temperature oh your worries\nAre you worried about climate change impacting where you live give us a call our number eight for for seven to four to five five eight four four seven to forty two five five\nYou can also tweet us ... fry a so Dr living the the goal is to prevent it to degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nThat even a one point five degree increase is gonna bring some pretty big changes [noise]\nYeah that's absolutely right said that and pass it actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and now is because some of the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm welding to tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\nOn and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nIn ... for example\nExcept for example on what they found\nW ... members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nI'm at least once every five years is two and a half times worse\nTwo degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer on when you don't have any ice on top of the Arctic or this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nBut at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further\nBecause you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and while that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people\nBeing impacted a species losses um two times worse for both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming\nThree times worse for insects I'm almost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the Arctic in the Arctic I said these are some really big numbers one of the most um devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we\nWould see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reef with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent ah which is just tremendous\nYou know does it look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the river to orange or to\nSee what the report finds is that both on two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um\nTo make that transition happened on right now a emissions are roughly fifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide\nPer year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net emissions altogether\nThis is a tremendous transformation and the combination rage that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about and it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to me at one point five pathways\nWe're talking about reducing energy demand increasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nUm a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them do we need\nTo know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can you can you answer at least who commission did what they do they use [noise]\nSure so on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists\nAnd had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assess all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius\nAnd see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published on and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea\nUm about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators come make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policy makers so in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report\nAnd uh we have a lot of people want to talk about what I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice\n[noise] yes hello so we're\nAnd I think what ends up confusing but when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it what really hurts us and I will culture\nThe high temperatures that record highs so for example in the Midwest is corn\nOver Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills\nCentral Valley of California when tomatoes when the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this is really critical of the er the highs not just the average temperatures\nAnd fixes by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north America for a screw back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the out to the atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had a little ice age and I wish more the scientists will talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel ...\nOther things like that that will instill Vegas grow more\nPlants and we didn't have them for food feed and feel I buy you are you a farmer [noise]\nNo I'm a researcher actually but I have a small farm and on the developer energy super which make food for food feeding fuel all

assistant professor of biology at California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks welcome to science friday I think it's great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey for my childhood\nAs one of the first animals went into space wow what got you fascinated with study\nThough I'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I wanted to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nAnd I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in\nSo off I went to um Amazonian Brazil for twelve months and I thought it would just be one you know one project one season\nBut the more time I spent there the more I\nBecame fascinated with all kinds of questions about them and I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild [noise] um I kind of know why now after so many years\nThey're very challenging [laughter] um but yeah that's how it all started wow a movie show how many do you study how many of the group a number of you study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor to a sweet groups regularly\nAnd let you do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them some\nSquirm one of the challenges of working with ... monkeys is that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them I'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality uh yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day in the life of a squirrel monkey\n[noise] okay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree and uh they spend a lot of time active uh all day they they're nonstop\nAh they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time foraging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\n... for their practice yeah or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd out with a head up and then they bite off the head\nKind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes\nAnd they seem very happy while they're doing it\n[laughter] and I understand they're not afraid to attack a ...\nWhy haven't they do that\nYeah so I've only seen adults do it but I've actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nest that Hank pretty low and once the adult lost desert the ness\nThe adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that left abandoned in the nest\nWow so they're pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient inpatient [laughter] those of us for not leaving so far right yeah I've done this myself\nWe have a clip I I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of ... of of of of the other one of the spider monkey let's let's hear that clip\n[noise]\nOur score a monkey I said spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah okay tell us when we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls I'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not\nNot a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I Can't recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver um but when there is you know ten of them in a tree it's kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\n... we have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm\n[noise]\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there's an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there it's a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that that's the sound that way\nThis is those a squirrel monkey so we're listening to\nIt might it might be birds actually because we're monkey sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest right um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of square monkeys instead of ...\nAnd how hard was it how much time has it taken you to know the difference to study this sounds to me\nSo it's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey whisper and knows everything about square monkeys and so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nAnd how long have you been doing that for a little longer\nHe started with with uh a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing for about Twenty years\nThe monkey whisper yeah well the caller yes sometimes he does me like it he loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about the human language or evolution of our language from from studying them the squirrel monkey\nSo um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming hypothesis and um the idea here is that you can try to understand the evolution of human language so the idea that humans\nLiving in social groups that we're increasingly large and so manual grooming sort of the the kind we seen bad dunes andme attacks\nBecame less less feasible really and so the idea that humans would have invented an alternative form of grooming vocal grooming so it would be a way to maintain contact and social bonds with their their friends\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow you know every year salmon go on the most important journey of their lives after living years in the wild wild ... much swim back to the coast\nAnd then ... miles of tributaries branches upstream until they finally finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this and well like\nAny good trip yeah you need a map and not just the compost just telling you were north is you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight north ... and more north east east than south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded\n... what did they have long suspected that Pacific salmon can detect\nThe magnetic field lines of beer beer map is they're magnetic\nAnd what about their Olympic willing cousins and when you let fish living quiet landlocked lines you know lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nHere to explain more is Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me\nYou know I just I just said about but sandman living impressive lions right they travel all that way how many miles did their journeys tech\nThat is pretty impressive and their journey can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds\n... and and they usually hedging these are these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct and they don't just have to navigate ups she may have to find the right stream to go how does he do this and that they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in\n[noise] yeah that's the same and have a diverse array of tools that\nThey use in order to navigate and so when they reach streams are they generally would use their sense of smell but in terms of the oceanic Journey Through the wages they use something more broad scale and and the term we think they're using magnetic nap and they get permission\n... now I Know that your research is looking at a different group of salmon the Atlantic salmon what what makes them so interesting to you\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants\nOf individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake\nMaine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish had never had access to the Pacific ocean and I've never\nAnd the instance of our fish outside of the hatchery\nAnd yet you found that they still have these Jew magnetic maps in them that they would have needed that they knocked ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these in one\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use different aspects of the magnetic field especially for math and so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different\nComponents one is the strength of the magnetic field or also known as my dad field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator another aspect\nOf the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth\nAnd so they're steeper toward the polls and shallower at the equator\nAnd both of these components predict or favorably are predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSo super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel so they formed a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do that\nSo there is the mechanisms behind Meg NATO reception are are still unclear but one of the leading hypotheses is that\nA salmon and other species have tiny chains of magna tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic property\nAnd so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells\nAnd the thought is that these chains can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields\nAnd so changes in both the field strengths and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials though these structures are thought to be found in the nose and also the latter alliance all along the sides of the body of a fish\nBut the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nMhm now why why is it important to you why why does it matter that they can still detect these fields well\nIt's a rather interesting question [noise] so we wanted to know whether\nW ... members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nIt's Atlantic salmon also possesses ability it's another group of individuals that does ethnic maps of diverse amount not amounts of these days but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic\nEnvironments one can they even detect the magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how did they actually respond\nMhm and so how did you go about testing research\nSo the eggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were ... and subsequently tested\nAnd so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coil and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire and when you attach copper wires to on an electrical power supply and crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct\nOf that electricity is a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that allows us to alter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\n... so what you're doing I Know from my basic physics you know great schools and if I take a magnetized object to put a next to some mentally will magnum pi the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to assure you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nSo we are presenting them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains of metal type right that right somehow connect with an herself\nRight and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement fish movement by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina\nAnd then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials so what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos\nPhotos and we assess the position of the fishes head relative to magnetic north\nWow\nThat's terrific and and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer course scale of the night ...\n... so what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nSo we have a whole number of experiments that we have talked about over the years but one of the experiments would be to actually look at my neck resolution of this map so having a theory that points moving them closer and closer together and to see how fine or course scaled their responses actually are\nMhm so uh could could you save endangered salmon man by knowing some more about them", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Brewster", "day": "13"}
