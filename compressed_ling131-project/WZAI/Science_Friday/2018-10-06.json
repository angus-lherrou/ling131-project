help from mathematician Eugene you're changing the first ...\nThe early morning wake up call from Stockholm to a handful of researchers whose work has changed their fields joining me now to talk about the prizes and others like Detroit subjects in science is Sarah cap on science reporter at the Washington Post welcome back\nThanks gets beer fabulous let's walk through the Nobel we're planning a to speak with chemistry Nobel from a Nobel is Francis Arnold later this hour but briefly what did you win for\nShow a doctor or not and two other researchers George Smith and Gregory Winter were awarded the chemistry Nobel for their work on directed evolution so this is basically one person called it applying the principles of Darwin in a test to\nTaking advantage of natural selection and using it to um kind of direct bacteria or viruses to produce molecules that can be used for all kinds of peaceful purposes whether it's\nMaking antibodies or biofuels or drugs\nMm I'm a chemistry Pulitzer Prize was split with two other researchers right Stuart Smith and Gregory Winter ... and what to what the day when for\n'em so they both work on a this technique called phage display which harnesses bacteria phages there are viruses that infect bacteria\nUm and it's kind of a ... the similar principle where you're taking advantage of these living systems to produce useful molecules proteins and anti bodies um that have all kinds of biological and medical applications and what about physics [noise]\nSo in physics the prize was awarded to three researchers who work with lasers a pretty cool [laughter] I'm Arthur Ashe skin Gerard morale and John Strickland 'em and they basically not just use lasers but use lasers as tools so African um develop this technique called optical tweezers where he basically\nFigured out that when you point a laser focused beam of light\nAtmosphere ... object to the object is actually drawn towards the center of the beam and you can use that to manipulate things as teeny as particles or as big as bacterial cells\nI've seen the tractor be China yeah right [laughter] it's a real life ... and fortunately it doesn't work on that large is unique accumulate they're pretty focus but um it's fun to think\nAbout [laughter] and ah after winning the dumbest ... explained what amazed her most about the research\nThink quite late generation is just one of these remarkable things one color [laughter] water any clear and sure enough and and it's just remarkable to sit there\n\n\nI'm Ira Flatow and you're listening to science friday we're talking with Dr Francis Arnold recipient of the twenty the Nobel Prize in chemistry I'm ... years a lot of people think you're a scientist but you were a very proud of engineer are you not\nI Am tell us what the differences well I Love to build things I'd like to make new things that didn't exist before of course chemists do that as well they build new molecules\nSo we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new proteins how do you\nBuild that I was watching a to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talk about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\n[laughter] yes it's really amazing it's changed so much in the thirty years that I've been doing this\nSo that today you really can't type out a DNA sequence now whether it's a recipe is a different story and we can talk about that but you can type out a DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nYou you're saying that talk that I I Want to write new DNA what does that mean to you\nActually it's easy to write and you know DNA what's hard is composing it you think about a DNA is the code of life it's the product of ... almost four billion years of evolution\nWe don't know how to compose new DNA we can ride it we can read it we can edited but we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes a of a complex biological function that didn't exist before\nSo if you if you ... what is the problem in the composition why can't you compose\nBecause we don't understand how DNA encodes function remember biology molecular biology is a brand new discipline\nIt's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty three so it's not been understood for but for a very short time and how DNA goes through\nAnd makes biological molecules and codes the the the the structure and function to these biological molecules is a brand new field and we still don't understand those rules\nAre so what you mean then and what what do people mean in ... when you say uh the directed evolution of something\nWhat is that process me well it's just like breathing it's we've been breeding cats dogs race horses lab rats corn for thousands of years without really\nManipulating the DNA directly but now that we can synthesize DNA and put it in a test tube\nI can go direct the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct negotiations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product out of that what's the next step [noise]\nSo you put the DNA into a microbe and they start reading it\nIf it were their own and are they in they then take the DNA and create the proteins that the DNA encodes than I as the breeder of molecules so to speak I have to decide who is better than what I started with\nWhich one of those microbes makes that are protein and that's called good old fashioned analytical chemistry so are you take the DNA out of that and feed it back and I do it all over again\nIt is it's sort of creating life in that cell is a new you're creating a new form of life or you're not [noise]\nWell I think that's probably exaggerating because life was there for me to work with were using the tools of biology to make new things I'm making new proteins they're not alive but they do do some things inside of cells but\nYou do you need the cell to help you make the prompting\nWell actually so you don't have to have the cell there's now very powerful systems where he can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test to with no cells at all\n... and so uh where do you rent truly see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human being\nOf biology the power of biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make their ... agents and and and pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess waste\n... I saw on you talked to said I have fun for us we molecules to have sex Oh yes [laughter] I Do [laughter]\nWell if you think about sex you have to wonder why nature would devise such a a a strange process and have all these half the population that doesn't carry the next generation\nSo there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else's and that benefit is the innovation that comes around\nIf you we combined DNA you get progeny\nRe combined DNA dieting codes something novel\nMhm she would get a phone call or two before we have to go let's go to ... Adrian and Hamdan I imagine [noise]\nHi this is a non and hand that um [noise] I grew up in Southeast Asia where my parents my cousin's everyone around me were just starting out their math or engineering my son who is about two and a half years old\nWhat I'm trying to figure out how to identify his mindset whether it be towards chemistry sports um math so may not be completely irrelevant question but I Would love to hear your\nThoughts on the subject how to identify your kids or younger generations um your skill sets that they can go towards chemistry or science says it\nOh did you know did you know what an early age Dr Arnold that you want to I\nI was lucky my father was the nuclear physicist and he always thought the girls to do math just as well as boys could so he never discourage me and I also had four brothers to compete with\nAnd I like being the winner [laughter] so I had a father who encouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know here there's from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model a mentor or somebody could even be their parents who kept him or kept alive ... encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nSeems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news mhm\nTo to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify any young age was talented in science\nI think all children are talented and if they love it they will ask questions they will do it I think the most important thing is not to discourage someone ...\nHave a tweet from Sydney who says please ask\nWhat she knows about how instinct is encoded in DNA example dogs urge to bury thing\n[laughter] I Wish I knew but it's clear that many important behaviors are at least partially genetically encoded loyalty and dogs are so many ah interesting behaviors\nOr they can be bred but we don't really understand what the genetic details of that are as we sequence more things and under and measure their properties will be using important and powerful tools like machine learning to peace out in to try to pull out what is that genetic\nBasis while you were you in his updated my my last question and that is are there what tools would you like to see I mean I can be well you've got some money now from the Nobel right what kind of tools would you that don't exist would you like to have\nWell I Want to be able to measure important properties rapidly\nSo that I can do this breeding faster I don't have a powerful enough tools to do that but I'm also interested in how do you use a guy and machine learning to interpret the results of evolution to make it even faster than it is now\nI noticed on your Ted Talk you said that one of your great ambitions is to be invited to give the Ig Nobel awards be [laughter] you know we broadcast the eggs every year the day after Thanksgiving and we know Marc Abrahams pretty good so I think we can put any yeah you know might be able to put in a good word for you know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow in a time of contentious use individual political races Ken we have better conversations about the issues that get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately our guest is Dr Eugene you change or mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago or new\nLogical world and um [noise] we want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners phoning in and first one Alex is from Chicago hey along a neighbor\n[noise] Hi there Hi there go ahead so up\nBy previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist um and I had done so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face\nI'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know how as a black male\nYou know you might be doing things that contribute to a white supremacist system that you might\nSo knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes to suicide you systems unknowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to identify as feminists\nUm it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminine system and so I'm being able to see the fact that you know I can still be a male male experiences while existing at him and that's um and identify myself in such a way it really changed my mind\nI'm In I thought about that that's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening\nThat he's you know as part of the problems that we don't see how we others see yes\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is that we often spend to you know trying to defend our end points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed as he is\nAnd one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that it was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences so in a way I think the logical used very\nCleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that to somebody else's analogous experience\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions don't require man he requires empathy empathy is carrying enough to respect another view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support double UCI at Cape and islands dot org\nThe bureaucratic purposes but I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me\nWith logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're mathematician or not\nBut talk about some from the current events or it's turned out to the artist topic and current events and that is voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault that good a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether that should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write that in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process as at places tell me what you mean by that\nThere's a whole other on a whole lot of different\nParts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because most of the people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence and the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for things and things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence there is a paradox because some people say well we have to put in the in ... someone innocence until that until that proved guilty\nAnd the thing is that if you have an accuser\nAnd and accused Boston or let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a product because we can't actually hold the mom I'm the woman both innocent at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and Salafi have studied paradoxes for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes by shifting levels are finding that things are at a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look up ... will that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time it it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at that well\nSo we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we kept\nThat so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so having a false accusation\nUm would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but ... isn't proved to be guilty and so it left off and that's\nReally about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we have somehow prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault over time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo and then ... them is a a question of black and white thinking and this happens a lot wet people get into arguments in extremes on so many of our arguments at the moment ton divisive because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between\nI'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like um you are making everyone into a rapist or watch one that professor lung but said on his book that that we are characterizing just spin the bottle crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale I'm Better off things that are\nAs bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape which comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is and straw puffing arguments where you can take that false equivalence and then you can declare it while you're saying everyone has a rapist\nSome people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind just by accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\n'em to finally um that's the question of knowledge and alternate hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing a little while you have to decide what you'll default position is\nAnd then say you say in the absence of other evidence I'm going to take this default position and I'm going to\nWait until I found enough evidence to change my mind and the thing is that in a court case to trial it's very important because we're going to punish somebody badly for something so before we do that we should be very show that they deserve to be punished whereas in the case of a Supreme Court\nAppointments than what we're doing is we're giving something something very good and important\nAnd so we should be very sure that they deserve that very good and important thing and in that case one might argue that that that\n[noise] there's a lot of rough

talk about ... toads and dung beetles why not they they interact a lot of nature the small worm like Paris I like to hitch a ride on their insect partners as they fly from one young Patti to another\nSounds like a pretty sweet deal for the need for naming toad right\nBut perhaps not so much for the dung beetle\nShooting nematodes actually ride on the Beatles general told where they can be passed on to their offspring or mates\nLike an STD now dung beetles put up with a lot of them done what do they stand to gain from this relationship\nMy next guest says as Vicki and it sounds there might be a very good reason for a living those parasites Lima aboard that decrease back to Christina ... is assistant research scientist in the department of biology\nAt Indiana University in Bloomington welcome to science friday Hi Ira\nSo tell me about these ride sharing arrangements between the dung beetle and the name of Joe that'd be to organisms interact\nGladly um well when the dung beetle is ready to reproduce they a tunnel underneath a done Patty and they create these developmental chambers out and done that we call it breed ball and in each of those ... balls they place a single egg\nAnd from being an egg to an adult beat all of that that developing beat all depends on his developmental chamber for its nutrients that for a shelter and protection\nAnd uh none of toads right along on these beetles they're they're small worms\nAnd um they end up in these developmental chambers along with the developing beetles and um we didn't know before whether that was a good thing or a bad thing um but we did know that um that this association existed and so this is something that we wanted to investigate more\nTo understand the consequences of interaction so\nTell me tell me what did you learn well um [laughter] we look to on all different parts of the um ... and we found them on various parts but we're particularly interested in is really high concentration of ... found on the genitalia um it's a good place for amateurs to hide but also it's a really\nCompelling a venue for getting to the next generation because it's involved and reproduction\nAnd so what we found was not only are are these ... passed between males and females but they're also passed off to the offspring and the offspring that develop alongside these nematodes actually\nThe larger than their counterparts um that don't have these ... and so there's actually a fitness benefit to having this um [noise]\n\n\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow and the past few years the field of exoplanet discovery has really taken off instruments like Kepler and they knew were test had been racking up the planet count but this week astronomers writing in the journal science advances\nBrought to helping to a new level describing the possible discovery not have an exoplanet\nBut at the moon orbiting an exoplanet to be specific\nKepler sixteen dashed twenty five ... be and his some four thousand light years away has to do that well joining me now to talk about the research is Alex ... cheese and and it sets graduate research fellow in the department of astronomy right here in New York at Columbia University welcome to science friday\nThank you very much for having me first what what moon is just we're ready to give us a little thumbnail description sure yes so it's\nA a moon as far as we can tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainties but as far as we can tell it's there are a large moon about the sons of Neptune actually which is sort of strange um orbiting this plant called Kepler sixteen twenty five ... and it's about eight thousand light years away as far as we can do\nSo but so what is the relationship with the size of the moon to decided appliance so the size of the planet is to buy the same size as Jupiter it's a little more massive as far as we can tell a and then the moon is uh like I say about the size of the mass of net\nBut even at a pretty unusual well moving that big well it certainly unexpected right when if\nThe moon's in our solar system ah we've got a lot of them are they're all ... significantly smaller than the earth so uh when we spotted this we said to you know this is what it looks like about the size of Neptune\nThat as sort of a raises new questions for people ... how do you get something that big it's a little premature to say how common are how rare something like this might be because ah this is potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things\nAh but ah you know you could argue that because it is the ...\nUh it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see so large\nYou know because we think of our moon we think of another body hitting earth and knocking out a piece of ... doesn't look like that and this case a yeah as far\nAs I said there's basically three mechanisms that we think we get a moons from an impact or scenario like how we got earth moon ah moons coalescing out of a disk of material swirling around the planet in the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons of Jupiter and Saturn Uranus\nAnd then finally a capture scenario like Neptune largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ... [noise]\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads a little\nBit yeah and we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but about detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nSure yeah so ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful ways so far\nIs using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the store like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip a from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks up some of the light as well in addition to that uh we try to see\nThe gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet\nAnd so that makes the planet wobble around a bit as it as it orbits the star and so\nSometimes I planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late and so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also a something ... are pulling on this planet that uh that uh we're attributing to them\nHey I just I mean that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they yeah well\nSo it's an extraordinary claim and is the famous thing goes Stordahl claim is a one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job trying to rule out other possible explanations for this signal\nWe're going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planted in the system uh that's that's pulling on this planet and making and walk around\nA those are all plausible explanations a but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations and uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such a an incredible claim\nOr maybe Incredibles not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm\nIt was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this that you're right very hard to get so you must have other people might want to know about\nThis very sure yeah yeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet in the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits it with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event or we observe this system for about forty hours altogether\nSo if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope ah from the surface of the earth so you'd have to stitch together multiple datasets for multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that are that they gave us the time\nThey're they're talking about the once the Hubble is is gone and um I I don't know why it should be but that's not for me [laughter] um it can be used up uh the Webb telescope is that right ... a better for you guys were looking an extra point it's going to be hell why\nIf it had been spectacular instrument it's a very very large mirror a and a aware as Hubble orbits the earth\nOr when we perform this observation you know you can imagine people staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out a James jaded just he won't have that problem and like I say the ... going to be really spectacular so\nUh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah uh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed many more people want\nWe're going to have to have a very good case you know there are downsides to another edition of obsolete is the wrong word but they're all everything is always an obsolete by the time he gets built whether it's a highway or something else I think some law well we should have made it twice as big we've had whatever yeah sure yeah you know so there's other\nTelescopes coming down the pike as their people bidding right now to what the we've talked about a W first and then there's a\nA telescope called who've war than ... ... yeah that's a\nUh I I don't know who's working on a bed and it's a ultraviolet and a red and optical that's L. U. V. I. O. R. and I think so uh that they come up with great names for these things are so there's going to be some fantastic instruments stadium Estee will definitely be an an improvement on Hubble\nBut you know Hubble was over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it ...\nIt is I'm All right so if this is a strange jar planted situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planted situation\nThat's a great question and one of the things that I ... I'm always saying to people is you know they always come with the question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems\nWe are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is the things going on here happened in a building in a hundred billion mother places are across the Milky Way or it's this very uncommon chain of events that that led to us here and that of course speaks directly to\nUh the question about the origin of life for example uh so it's particularly since this a moon is raising new questions about how you get something like this it's opening up some new questions about the dynamic will histories of these uh a planetary systems and and it speaks directly to that\nI don't know\nMm\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking with author Deborah Blum about how food safety protections came to be the topic of her new book the poison squad one camera single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century\nEight to five five I'm let's turn back the clock back to that time period Deborah or you have an entire chapter on catcher [laughter] what was so and after that\n... while you're devoted why rented I Know why or why devote the\nTell our listeners an entire chapter I catch [noise]\nSo this is a catch up it's just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have this very twenty first idea scrawny for a century idea of catch up which is you know kind of a sick tomato based kind of a but in the nineteenth again it tended to be a kind of thin\nNasty a sauce with a lot of vegetable ways to end that people would put pumpkin ... people would\nPut tomatoes that they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called Tara dies and then because the whole mess of it tended to kind of be rotten anyway they dumped preserve it as in a like sodium ... which is actually still with us today and\nSo this ... because this kind of battle ground of food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair\nAnd in this case I really love the story because\nIt makes a point that you know not every business is evil and a Henry J lines of ah the Heinz\nFood manufacturing company took it upon himself to get preservatives that are his ...\nHis products the reinvented catch up so the catch up we know today was really created by Heinz and he did it so there was a lot of tomato and I said\nThat kept the bacterial count down and then he really went to war a mean this was a battle between business and advocates and and ... business friendly government and Heinz ... though he was a big believer and profit really\nPushed for safer products and actually sent kids or some of the people who work\nWith them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have\nGot to regulate food safety\nThe things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food there were afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives I Want you to do something and catch up kinda catches all of that plus you know there was major combat over the preservatives and get er and that was pretty fascinating but let's talk\nAbout a Harvey Washington where I was a little bit more than ... ...\nHe actually started where people were volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out food safety ever tell us about that because what one of the ... you have someone was amazing [noise] it's\nJust crazy you I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think if you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control\nBut what happened was he had been working really since we're about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know at completely not able to move this forward politically\nAnd he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animals safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things in the human beings and so that's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment\nIn which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerously and the deal was they would eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and\nAll kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time had to be adding capsules of the compound that he was testing at various doses from very low to very hot\nAnd so during the ... squad experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food he looked at bore acts which is a cleaning product he looked at salad silica said which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these are these tests\nAnd what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems and because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this is front page news all across the country you were food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivated hymns wanted you know create this poison the water gets to the bottom of the food safety\nKnow that's a great question I think he was kinda\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support WC I at Cape and islands dot org\nKids ah with this kind of sense of higher calling and and widely really I mean what was interesting about him was that\nHe took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never really been interested in from the very beginning and then he just starts feeling at a party is feeling the layers of it apart\nAnd the more he realizes how at risk people are the more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying\nWe'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that uh the role of the government [noise] hang on ...\n[laughter] they can take a drink of water [laughter] there you go um [noise] he\nHas this very early sense of the role of the government when we say in the constitution promote the general welfare this is kinda how I said\nHe really means promote the general welfare and your everyday life that part of what we do is we stand\nUp for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an advocate as much as a scientist and that's\nProbably right but he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually did\nThat's the thing that one of the things I Love about this story it's a story of a single person who drives the conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation\nOn our way we think about food safety so did he actually we're in we're in their laws created because of his crusade where the Congress actually put teeth and the FDA and things like that can be\nI Am so after you know he's like battling away stymied by\nEventually in Nineteen oh six to laws passed then one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair as the jungle and the ... the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug active Nineteen oh six passed a somewhat carried by that tunnel tidal wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act and that was an and I we've forgotten\nFirst great consumer protection low ever pass by the federal government and so\nIt was the moment in which we all agree as a society that the government's job is in part to protect the average citizen from harm and to stand up in that way if you asked why he would say okay\nThat was a star but the law was immediately weekend by business interactions which\nIt was to the point that he he ended up extremely frustrated\nI don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished but and eventually that law led to a law in the Nineteen thirties that created the modern FDA so a lot of people still call him the father of the FDA even though he died before it was created\nYou know you were said though that you disagree with some of his of his tactics [noise]\nYou know he was as I say kind of a holy roller yeah and he became very rigid I think some of that was that he was under attack constant attack both in government and out of it for Thirty years and he kind of awesome five to some extent and a perpetual defensive position", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Brewster", "day":
