story you'd like to share with the bat you were a C section or your partner C section why you had it\nGive us a call late for for seven to for eight to five five where you can tweet us at science fry phone eight for for seven to for eight to five five or tweet at scifri\nBut first last week's report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change gave us a sobering look at what a world worn by two degrees Celsius might look like\nThen on the heels of that report Exxon Mobil announced that it was throwing financial support behind a U.S carbon tax it's a big step for one of the world's largest oil companies which last year was sued by its own employees for misleading statements about the environmental and financial impact of fossil fuels\nAnd has a history of denying the climate science settled\nHere with the story as well as other short subjects in science is on there are finding a staff writer for vox mayor welcome back to science friday\nThanks for having me again so Exxon says it's going to back us carbon tax on the surface that sounds like a good thing but what exactly are they proposing\nProposing to back a lobbying effort launched by conservative former secretaries of state George Schultz and James Baker\nThis is a group called the climate leadership council and it proposes starting with a forty dollars per ton price on carbon dioxide emissions and that price would rise over time then they would use that money to go back to people like you and me essentially in the form of a dividend or rebate and the estimate is that what started about two thousand dollars a year for a family of four\nThere is a catch though and Exxon wants ... ... a roll back some other environmental regulations and one big catches that they want immunity from climate change related lawsuit that want damages for these companies\nIt's the same deal that the the gun producers have\nYeah pretty much it's kind of analogous to what they got and it's what I'm other industries have also tried to get\n... ah actually has a complicated relationship with climate change it it's been a head of the industry in acknowledging it's a problem\nThey've had researchers who helped to author the PCC report and yet they are also being sued for misleading people about the impact of fossil fuels years ago and in two thousand they took out ads in newspapers saying that the science was not settled I mean should we be taking this seriously or is it just another\nYou know and make us look good sort of thing\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of C sections happening all over the world listen to this worldwide rate has nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent in the past\nFifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se he's by C section now\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is uptick what are the effects on mothers and babies and what into vengeance can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rapes globally also what's happening here in the U.S\nAnd my question for your listeners is did you or your partner to get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number eight for for seven to for eight to five five you can tweet us at\nScience fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy is an author author on that lasted\nSiri she's also professor of midwife midwifery at the Yale School of nursing thank you for joining us today alec enemy\nThank you uh tell us alliances series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions that must have buried around the world\n[noise] well it does and what we found was that over sixty percent of countries over UC sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery is enormous on thing to do\nPart of it has to do with um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it's it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nBit of a paradox when what we would call 'em too much too soon and too little too late so in the country's than overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough access probably are under using it for the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... about right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as his area and we're way\nOver was talking about over ... there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's a it's an accepted norm of this part of the culture in in Brazil\nMhm are there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the province\nExactly and again that has to do with access\nAnd a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this has area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because [noise] um and as soon as area and is not a low risk\nUm surgery it is it's a major surgery and and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth in preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and that's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states who are increasing maternal mortality rate\nYou mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and\nThey're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when women really needs it\nAnd I think it's important to stay in the outside there are women who and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority\nLittle bit above to what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be vice chair of quality in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr ...\nThank you for having me oh let's let's talk about this um ... there's also this idea of of planned the C sections right the due to do you have to approach this do you ever ... have you seen there's been your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... in the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have the delivery of biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver I'm In our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise in Syrian delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and\n[noise] yeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make the recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nUm it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics so there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\nOn the progress during labor in terms of the cervical digression I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on a labor and delivery unit that might put some pressure on us to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that um patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but the general\nReaction to oh I Would completely agree with her that the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having a badge and birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her\nAnd her physiology two two best achieved imagined a burst\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Hi Lauren welcome to science friday\nIra thank you You're welcome good\nThough I actually had an emergency C section at\nThirty one leaf um and I went deeper thankful for that for that [noise] um but when I got pregnant for a second time I really wasn't given the option of having that occurred after effects and um I kind of had to do all that\nUm education and he said on my ... so I had to look at the website I had to look at rates and what were the very end mighty you took pregnancy and um it really was up to me it was um like my provider\nAll that you want to have the time I was like oh sure I'll have to repeat that but I was that get that that risk and benefits are able to make a truly at it\nThat says um and so I think that um I was able to\nActually land ex senator and heat and then I changed my mind at thirty six and my provider with really ... them with that and I was able to have you back but I feel like there was a lot of them are nice and given to me by my provider I really had to\n\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of C sections and what that means for women's health\nMy guests are Dr Holly Kennedy professor midwifery at the Yale School of nursing the Tony Golan vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line let's see we only uh\nGosh I Can't get there but let me ask you how are you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k.\nOr do what we do here in the U.S\n[noise] well it it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out that W World Health organization also issued\nNew guidelines to help help us look at decreasing says Erin's and and one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have\nA collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that ... was a a so seeded with improved outcomes increasing including decreasing C sections until one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midwifery across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest sea section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent of births are attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent adverse are attended by midwives\nAnd then they met that with outcomes and\nUh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it is an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um when you have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with\nTheir midwife midwifery knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nA tornado when you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital a deal after a decade went from forty twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\nWell first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says area\nAt the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky it's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well and nonetheless obstetricians\nBase decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make\nSurgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test nonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use feel heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using\nScience and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focus on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific modern definitions for progress in labor\nA old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor the newer more modern data really proved to us we want it to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and um and do the other than for the back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor misspoke there is a bit of Israel and would do if you were always from so bone down here in Boston so there's this whole me now to the to the hospital you go to determines more or less if you'll have a C section Ina\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on Syrian delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery race may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work and the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr wherever Toledo that's relevant to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies ... and versus a typical delivery did did you study that in your your your report Holly\n... a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendations\nWomen who were have more money per were wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more per se is area and to really um level the playing field in in ... in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one and in time or perceived to be in time [noise] mhm ...\nYou're you're gonna miss me issue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the u._s. ah where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery then is his area and delivery\nHowever the hospital does and that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients I'm and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here in the U.S a reimbursement is greater but it really goes more toward the hospital side because of the length of stay let's go to Sharon in Somerville mass harsher\nHigh um I've had two C sections on a um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications real Crohn's disease and so I'm I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends think things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if you could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that\nKind of questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know push the baby out that generally and and that was really upsetting to me because\nMy two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me and I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those up the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions\nAnd I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um and different direction slide I'd love to hear the response\nOr a got about a minute or so on who you're only would I Would I Would completely agree with you\nIn this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that you have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... and are fully ... fully discuss I'm Antonia\nWhat about this the charge of sexism their\nPoint well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how a baby is born\nOn the person who gives birth to the baby becomes the parents uh after that happens on its know lesser no more regardless of what the motives delivery ... delivery on certainly makes you just as much as the mother on as having a vegetable delivery\nYou're listening to the

in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\n\nThink about bees and answering spiders tiny as they are they're all vital parts of our ecosystem where there is food or pollinators are predators and they have another thing in common complex social behavior I think about the term hive mind right\nThis idea that all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world but\nHow well does that actually work out\nWhat factors make a colony more or less successful and kind of individual behavior still took the hand of fate for the whole group\nOr the hives and be legion\nMy next guest looked at these questions Alice Waters is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the lives of bumblebees and no pitcher woman is an associate professor at UCLA looking at these social behavior of these ants and even spiders [noise]\n\n... what did you know I if you ask everybody you they'll tell you that honeybees get all the attention right now but you've gravitated to bumble bee why was\nMy did my PHD in a honeybee lab um but I went Robie and work done by movies instead I started a PHD in two thousand sex which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit that we can use to answer all kinds of\nReally cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to only bees bumblebees have a very different like cycle right out of the colonies gets dark\nFirst honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social um there's never a point in their live in a life as a hobby queen where she's living on her own but\nAn annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony and he's queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely\nOn their own and then in the spring I these queens have to crawl out of there over wintering spot and start their own ness so they spending most of their life living on their own and so even though there are social insects and they have queens\nAnd workers and that sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary and sex are part of their life cycle to\nYou and you weren't brought an show us what we do\nI Do yes you'll notice from the get go that it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees\nActually share a common origin of sociology so we think that the ancestor to both of these groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor was social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so\nThey've all these differences and today they look really different way then that's the way that they live\nDr ... meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we turned to confuse the two kinds of bees is having equals lifestyles all the time really well to be to be\nRight well I consider honeybees is a ... and swings my lab actually so these ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focus and the ants and so\nSome of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forging how different individuals and economy contribute to forging ... your ... with ... German harvester from I'm here in California ...\n... slightly larger than what you are a little bit longer there but yeah and ... even the ones you see on the sidewalk\nAnd ... why are you interested in them\nSo these areas and the blacks are the true however ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between ... so a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they forward and how quickly they call their friends to food so another thing I brought here as in ... and flip it over I was on its\nOh so it was like that that sort of cast of\nSo like pouring plaster Paris\nIt's exactly faster flyers from Home Depot\nHow far does not go down as just the whole life I Know that's just the top part about six or eight inches long it looks just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did when ... um which is a type of metal said when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when it hardens it's easier to dig around and it's a little break like the plaster\nAnd so we can see that if it was much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I said he was the these there's a lot of Fox so that determines how they can go\nThrough so much focus on queen bumble bee what about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones said the ... the drones don't do too much for the call any itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's an important point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this woman who was really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen there what something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumblebees do we how do you make a queen\nWell for the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point during really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker\nAnd if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her\nAnd what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sort of trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point\nUh but we think that there are probably also factors in the ... just like there are and honeybees and bumblebees and people just haven't looked for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from Iran and foot start right or were there on the right side yes go ahead please\nUm my um my mom is\nAllergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to 'em\nLike helped her heal her when she gets styles that is a great question I'm allergic to bees too [laughter]\nFor ... and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies\nUm that's a really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the terrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were somebody being me to\nUm those a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I\nThat there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the victim and the B interact interesting great quick course yeah great question\nAre no longer answer also live in big groups with the queen how were they are large different from something like a honeybee\nWell there's a lot of ... and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities in some differences in first of all many of them live underground whereas bees will and\nPut their hives and say the fame three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example the honeybees in some species of ants will relocate from one site to another so honeybees will go and look for a new nest site and can the way the shape of the\nEntrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ants will off there's a species of frog dance that will look for certain privacy is it again have small entrances and our dark places so there's some similarities in some differences\nI think the sizes and one thing there's some species that have a colonies that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands and even up to ... million so at least cutter\n... can be up to a million individuals\nAnd just been talking for Halloween I Know that you also studies social spider word or social spider\nSo upset about more than forty thousand species of spider is only about forty species are so our social um and what happens is they are and live in groups and the reason we think they leave in living these groups is so that they can capture pray that is larger than them and so they offered lead build these\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the civic arch plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\nHow did you sleep last night\nAbout being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard but I Am not the only one I can see from the audience said just six about sleep in the United states among other countries aren't great\nFewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease chronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole ... but\nIt is our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules could there be jeans at work\nMy next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep and how well we recover from last week and he's found one of these genes in a surprising place\nNowhere near the brain welcome back took a team of Paul associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los\nAngeles [noise]\nIs that right you need to get seven hours of sleep a night that's what the usual requirement is yes\nFor um the majority of long term studies that have looked have found that if you get\nSignificantly less was significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night than that doesn't\nWork out well for you in time in a lot of trouble yeah\nBecause I get like six if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that that\nWell how can I add in all honesty I'm of a six hour crowd myself why do we need to sleep and the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what\nWe do know is bad if you don't sleep adequately bad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first are where we can sort of short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just maybe for the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow\nYour memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do those tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects if you continue Bailey on a regular basis not getting enough sleep\nThat impairs your immune system which\nMakes you at higher risk for infectious diseases\nAnd it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease\nStroke and diabetes now mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping and interestingly enough I think our genes are pretty much involved in everything we do ... what does it what about sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours of the\nQuality what what is one of the genes Julie that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about genes is you're not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment so I was like to\nPoint out of the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works\nI'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role in timing sleep I'm there a time of day you prefer to sleep at the time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day or sleep most of the night\nOn what we're trying to understand our\nWhat genes are responsible for the restored if properties of sleep the things about sleep that\nPreserve your memory and your ability to focus and the things about sleep then improve your health the genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on now what fascinated me about reading about your research also\nWas that these genes that help with our control sleep\nOr not in our brains they're not in our heads\nWell they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain they're expressed in the body the gene that I focused on in my most recent studied beam on one is expressed in the majority of tissues in which\nWe have ... so the mall one is what's known as the clock seeing your clocks in every selling your body very real clocks in order for\nSomething to be characterized as a clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it has to be an ... and the timing mechanism like gears talk to my students about gives on the clock most of them don't know what collectors are [laughter]\nSo I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time I have is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time the majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep for a long time we've been very interested in how these\nEarly in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain and most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks and the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain and tell your brain\nHow to sleep more importantly\nHow to recover from sleep loss and when you mean how to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your terms that's out of the heat on if it goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep processes works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more\nIf you get too much sleep will go on to the other direction the clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature in the evening it says to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover\nFrom sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes that are like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from you know so when you say the clock\nIs that the the circadian rhythm we've\nBeen talking about the circadian clock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronized has a clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism in what isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours Russian overhear\nYes I have a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that it's a really cool thing to have an [noise] how might that play with the clock that you're speaking of itself\nSo napping is a is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way\nThey win by yourself in that oh I Do I got one of the great\nThings about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles in the afternoon no one can complain\nCan write at all I mean I Know what I'm doing research [laughter]\nYou're not getting daily stuff is asleep and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap\nAn hour's usually was about recommended but I think from a half hour to an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much so that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism\nUm especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons\nSometimes between one to three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now oh gosh I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't blame them either directly right that's why I don't try to understand but that's just me ... let me go to the questions on this side yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep ah ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the day",
