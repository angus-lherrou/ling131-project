I'm a shanty why she couldn't afford 'em commercial than she pads because he'd seen them in the market\nAnd she said well it's either a Senator Pat old milk and we need milk and from that I'm Maria got because he's a bit of an extraordinary fellow um spent twelve is coming up with a low cost sanitary pads machine that can be money they'll ...\nWomen and there are now four thousand of them old over I'm full of the world but the way he got to understanding he had to do a reverse engineering to understand what was in commercial than if you pass because he thought it was just caught and yeah\nSo he decided that the best way to do that obviously was to wake up his own uterus in the form of\nUm a a a goats plaza filled with a goat blood and I'm Sorry yeah there was a football field to go slogan blood and he had touched it to his clothing and had a little pump\nAnd once around all day and every so often pumped it and so I tried to simulate the experience of Ayman striking woman I'm an he learned a lot [laughter]\nA lot of men would if they did that [laughter] um and also\nBecause he lived in South India where it's hot he uh he was wearing white so which is pretty much everyone is Nightline them out of what sounds you pat advertising has told us over the years\nAnd so you know there was stains and leaks nice to have a lot of time checking behind themselves like women do a lot and um he eventually came understood what was in such pets and\nHas revolutionized sun spots in India quite an amazing fellow\nAmazing so it's a good you know more men should try that out [laughter] make her house the trials and tribulations\n... women go through the skin with football [laughter] I I think there's so many great little um moments in your book on little statistics that just jump out let me go through a few of them you have a staff that every three seconds someone received a blood transfusion\nWow ... ... you know the joke behind that is they ought to find that guy and stop them from there [laughter] but\nIt's such a ... in the states is that she every two seconds is that right yeah and uh I was given the breakdown of the biggest idle idle makes sense\nI how how did this idea of banking blood first come about\nWell what I mean we haven't been this the system that we're all used to which is the mass donation and I'm supply and transfusion of blood it's really not very old a total of about a hundred and Twenty years old\nAnd in the beginning I'm In the U.S in the u._k. they ... they started in pretty similar fashion that people were selling that blood um they had this project that they could sell them on and so they did\nAnd it was even a union of love celebrate New York and other people\nCountry I'm selling that blood so they're with their own kind of blood market um but eventually in the Nineteen thirties uh adoption Chicago called signed up to ... to ... I'm trying to organize things a bit better and he was\nConvinced that the best thing to do 'em ... blood as a commodity really so he thought that what when ten must come out and if you used blood you should supply blood to so he sets up a blood bank\nUm I'm actually that transformed I'm In the Nineteen seventies in in the U. S. um the notion of paying full blood um died out and it's now a whole donated not illegal to sell your blood\nIn the U.S but it's just no it's frowned upon and not done\nOne of the you know I when I was in college a new lots of college students who was showing their blood for for money just you know for some spending care\nWhere you can still do that that you you what you're doing is selling blood plasma and so you're selling the yellow stuff fifty five percent of\nLiquid in your blood and um yeah you can do that the u._s. has got very very generous regulations that house and you can do that can do it twice a week if you want to know other countries on ... plasma during his do it every couple of weeks but um\nYeah you can and says he's fifty dollars a pop selling a plasma us so yeah it's a good income stream for other people\nAnd now you write that that the U.S is seen as the ... pack of plasma [laughter] like where it is a cartel of plasma\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow that can be brass in through your nose short cuts deep into your brain ... notice anything different other than maybe how the rooms smell [noise]\nRecent studies suggest that breathing through your nose can be linked to improve memory and that's a new to hold on view mouth breather fear here\nThe report to the brain controlling emotion and memory is Christine is on oh this is a professor at Northwestern University Feinberg school of medicine doctors on and welcome to science friday\nHi thank you I'm happy to be here\nWe're happy to have you so what is so special about breathing through your nose\nWell a nose breathing is special because it's how we smell and smell is a fascinating and really unique sensory system\nSo evolutionarily smell is our oldest sense it's also arguably the least understood of our sensory systems and there are several key aspects of smell that make it particularly interesting and that make nose breathing really different from mouth breathing so for one thing\nThe smell neurons which live up way up at the very top of our nasal cavities\nThey actually touch the air as it flows in and out of our noses just during natural breathing and this is really unusual because these olfactory neurons are the only part of our central nervous system that makes direct contact with our external world\nAnd the way that this information gets from these neurons inside of our noses\nInto the brain is different from all other sensory systems so all other sensory systems information relays through a structure called the thalamus before it reaches the cortex and higher order brain areas\nBut in the olfactory system information flows straight from the nose into the cortex and higher order of brain areas as well without going through the thalamus um and what's special is that these olfactory structures are located in a part of the brain called the limbic system\nWhich is involved and emotion and fear learning and memory so this gives little faction of sort of privileged access to emotion and memory areas in the brain and and because a nose breathing is smelling\nNasal inhalation provides a sort of entry point by which breathing rhythms can modulate brain activity in these structures\n... or so just the act of breathing in through your nose was you know also since the air is coming in and learn these this pathway on the end point in your brain and save up and your drink things happen\nIt yes actually it does so that the receptors inside of the nasal cavity or not only response\nMonitoring ah the chemicals in our environment but they also are that can er receptors so they can detect the air flowing in and out of the the nose yes um and we found that these natural respiratory rhythms just breathing even in the absence of any smell\nOf drives activity in olfactory areas but interestingly these these respiratory driven brain waves they don't stop there so we found that they also propagate to nearby limbic structures the the ones involved and emotion and memory so what this means is that as we breathe\nActivity across the limbic system is rhythmically increasing and decreasing within hails enact sales I'm In this pattern what we found is that it's only present when you're breathing through your nose so if you breathe through your mouth that rhythmic limbic activity goes away\n... you know a lot of us believe maybe erroneous labor but you can suddenly smell something that you remember from Thirty years ago right is is that a ... a real thing or a ... and I'm\nA well for me it's real but why is that something special to that your sensory Oregon\nOh yeah you know the evidence is not clear that the study is sort of conflicting on that um a couple of studies have found that perhaps olfactory memories memories tend to be earlier I'm not necessarily stronger\nUm but I Would say there's no clear consensus on on whether or not that's true\n... one of ... what about breathing through your mouth and I do anything for you I mean [noise] uh we we as as far as his tasting food we've always been told that you smell the food through your nose and helps your taste buds taste what it what you're actually doing is there a connection there\nRight that is true that is a good point um and that's that's what's called retro nasal olfaction so when when we have food inside of our mouth\nI'm the air can get from our oral cavity into our nasal cavity but it flows and the backwards direction so it's going outward rather than in word um and it definitely impacts flavors and and taste yes\nLet's talk about your study how were you able to study this I understand that you were able to test this with an F. MRI\nOh actually I'm no that's an and that's very\nIs fmri right because in the human brain the olfactory structures are actually located very very deep almost in the center of the brain\nUh making them very hard to reach non invasive Lee so we can't record from these areas from electrodes on the surface of the scalp\nAnd functional neuro imaging uh we cannot really measure\nUm brain oscillation with that technique so to do this study we worked in collaboration with brain surgeons who implant electrodes wires directly into these limbic areas for patients who are undergoing brain surgery for epilepsy\nAnd this provides just a really rare opportunity to record this type of data\nFrom human olfactory and limbic structures\nAnd if it falls faction and memory or related do you see people with memory problems also having issues with smell [noise]\nAh that that's a really good point um a lot of neurodegenerative diseases actually do present with early olfactory declined um and well I think are these findings that we're discussing or may not have direct implications for neurodegenerative disease I think I'm\nThe impact of of breathing on limbic activity certainly suggests potential new avenues and directions of research on on these diseases um for example\nIt you know it'd be interesting to know if these mechanisms may be altered in nerd degenerative disease um and I I also think\nThat our data point to the possibility that neurodegenerative disease could result in all altered nasal breathing patterns I'm breathing is so easy to measure\nAnd this is something that we are looking into and in the lab so do um patience with different neurological disorders do they breathe differently do they have characteristic nasal breathing patterns\nAnd so that's something you're you're going to be following up we're right yes under any neurodegenerative disease in particular\nUh we're we're currently collecting breathing data from patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with Parkinson's disease to see if we can differentiate the two um states just by analyzing the shapes of their breathing wave forums\nOr are we the only thing I'm going to just throw ... really dumb [laughter] are I mean why do we need to breathe through our mouths if we have\nTo read through our mouth yeah you know I I really ... watch this and I spent a lot of time thinking about that actually I I mean I think\nThe answer probably goes far beyond just the sort of immediate thought which is that if your nose is congested you have this alternate breathing route so that you can still get Aaron and still live in one that was ... and um\nBut we're finding that it really drastically changes our brain activity so I think that the full answer to that question really remains to be seen and I think it's a really interesting point I Know that um well most mammals that that I can think of do\nPant and parenting is is typically something that involves mouth breathing so dogs pant not only when they're hot but I think also when they're stressed uh cats as well and I think that's um something interesting about that\nYou just learn how short life is and how fragile it is and do appreciate everything that you have around you because they thought they were going home and now they're here with me it teaches me a lot don't sweat the little things and just to pull your loved one's a little bit closer\nYou are listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations [noise]\n\nYou're listening to W. ca I your local news and information for the cable because many island Ninety point one WBAI and W.

I felt that um and just also like looking at the portrayal of masculinity and kind of the way that the whole movie came together around that I thought was a really ... and a lot of ways ... what did you think\nOn a personal level I really enjoyed it for me it's the first person aspect versus just sort of watching it from the outside you could really put yourself in the movie and you know most of us will never get to fly in space so getting to actually experience it in a way I was really a fun way to have it movie made\nMhm us up for throughout the film we see Neal Armstrong as a dispassionate mhm reserved contained and that was part of his engineering mine said here's an here's a clip\nPlanning on taking some voters or the new buzz sure would follow wouldn't want to give his wife bragging rights [noise]\nNeal when you take anything\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands die to work\nIn a way I'm I'm I like the movie quite a bit it's a it's a flood movie but it's really great movie\nI really think this is a a movie that captures the other side of the right stuff so to speak to engineering technical backgrounds and the kind of commitment these guys needed to have beyond just be fighter drunks and\nAnd that kind of internal narrative internal uh I'm kind of story in this in this movie about what it took to be an astronaut\nI think we do is communicated really effective and was he as reserved as you went as you knew him well I didn't really I don't think any of that well but from what I understand he was very reserved but he was not I think as perhaps dour as portrayed in the movie\nOr you had a sense of humor he was a funny guy but I Do think he had a lot of struggles in his life and as his biographer Jim Hansen has talked about uh [noise]\nUm you know there were some serious problems struggles in his family life and also with his colleagues in Aspen enough so you know I think it's a bit of both you was I think he was he was a bit um perhaps reticent but um but I think he was also a capable of just being kind of chilling out [laughter]\nYou know you didn't get that impression too much in the movie not so much in the movie but I think the movie was focused on those aspects of his career in life that required concentration and diligence\nYeah and there's your urine and you're an engineer did you feel like there was a fair portrayal of any engineer\nI engineers have a whole variety of personality so I think he saw a few different personalities that movie and if you look across a lot of movies you see that there's an engineer there is a very serious one they're the ones that are super outgoing so it's certainly a fair trial because pretty much every personality type exists in engineering\nAnd one thing that struck me about this film was how jarring and difficult all the scenes of space flight where there you had the Neal is cramped the launches were teeth rattling and it was just disorienting any time we saw people flying a ... a new to me is that realistic to you\nI think there was a lot of realistic aspects that you know people if you have this fun floating feeling that especially in the Gemini capsule the mercury there wasn't a lot of room that you were really crammed in there at the cockpit right in your face the control panel so I think that with a very accurate portrayal all the switch in cages are just right there so that\nAnd then of course the rocket ride up till can be a very bumpy so that was certainly true\nLet's go to the phones Andrew in Sarasota, Florida welcome to science friday Andrew\nI think I got disconnected there for a moment um yeah I was saying it just since you happened to mention the program we hear a lot about mercury and we hear a lot about\nA but Apollo but I feel like the Gemini program is under served the first time man stepped out into the void and Americans ... Fox I think that's a story worth telling\nHey thanks for that call you know I have a lot of people don't realize you know in in that scene in the movie where he couldn't couldn't troll the orbiting the rotation and he had the right stuff to pull out of that that's why he got the first seat you know to go landing on them oh\nYeah I think that's definitely one of the factors that kind of um [noise] made it much more visible and they asked for an office there were I mean there are other candidates for the job\nBut for sure the Gemini eight experience was a a really key point I was a really dangerous missions and I was just looking at all life magazines from that month and it was widely reported that the time as a kind of really a kind of an amazing exciting moment in the space race\nA kind of successful failure in that sense but a a a fantastic a moment captured really nicely in the movie\nAs the one person in the room who remembers that real in real time I can say that it was very very exciting I'm ... the big emotional punch\nOf the story was and Neal's grief over the death of his daughter when she was just two years old and then the last so the fellow astronaut lead up to Apollo you know weapons Apollo one whatever how do you think these humans just lost his shaped history as has played out\nA well I you know I mean these things were a if as I think is also communicate in the movie the fighter pilots test pilots were very familiar with losses because they had been at um air force bases and they're many of their colleagues were um you know not making it back home from test flights so\nIn in many ways they were used to it but nobody's really used to last us like that and especially losing a child is something that nobody can really knowing this happened to them\nMhm\n\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking about Neal Armstrong as portrayed in the new movie first man from the personal hardships the astronaut over claimed to be\nTo have that story led to all the missions and since I'm a bit ... July night of Nineteen sixty nine\nAre my guests are Miriam Kramer science editor at the national review them around the human exploration mission analysis lead at NASA's Johnson Space center in Houston I was ... a professor history professor studying space exploration Fordham his most recent book is be under\nThe chronicle of these deep space exploration our number is eight for for seven to for eight to five five we have lots of tweets that came in um let's see what we get sued just a few of them tweet from Glen who says no one knows how much Russia pull up put the first spacecraft into orbit\nOr the first human we did this knowledge come from it was really get us into the space race I asked you at the beginning of the hour to tell us what kind of film you would like to see that hasn't been make it I think that's who's ... is an effort at explaining a film he would like to see much go to the phones for another suggestion\nLet's go to Alan in Cleveland Hi Alan welcome to science\nFriday I Love your show glad to be on the go ahead go ahead Alan yes go ahead oh I Would love\nFor some sort of biopic or something to be done about ... Carroll Janice and um you know there are very few African Americans and space exploration very few women and he was the first African American woman\nTo go into space exploration and not only that she just seems like a like a really cool person hang out with I mean she's done dancing and acting\nWith on Star Trek and she graduated high school at sixteen and\nUm you know and she was that very inspired by the civil rights and the thing I just feel like he's just all around to fill a multifaceted fascinating person to do a movie about and I'd love to\nSee the rest of the something about her you're\nNodding very much in agreement oh yeah I may Jonathan has is very cool I've I've met her a few times and it's just always a a treat to talk to her about it when you tell us a little bit about our history and um I I think pretty much what what the caller said yeah this is what I Know over ... ah she's just like like a really\nInteresting life filled with a lot of different things from science to the arts did you\nUh on age I was saying that yeah there are certainly a lot of a background um she flew wanting to shuttle flights early wants for women and and I think there'd be a really interesting story to tell her\nI said yeah absolutely I think there would be amazing stories or um you know or like this amazing then there's a treat from a tweet from emphasis how about the early women astronaut to didn't fly or perhaps\nDid for something like an interesting time over there are all these behind the scenes story right\nYeah there are I mean I think um [noise] it that's the mystery that Thirteen right uh so I I they're I Believe was a ... some kind of Netflix theories about about that and also some kind of documentary series that was regarded as\nYeah um and all the people who were in that control room and all the other places and you know\nAll kinds of all kinds of stories um interesting of\nHey this this was a movie um about heroes of astronaut certainly fifty years ago and it will be fifty years since the moon landing next summer which I'm having trouble getting my head around [laughter] and we also have Apollo Thirteen we have the right stuff wires Hollywood's still talking about things\nThat happened fifty years ago when so much has happened since when do you think [noise]\nYeah I mean that's a good question I think part of it is that\nYou know Apollo landing on the moon that was that was the big stuff like that was the big stuff that human exploration has has done in the last\nFifty years I mean that the shuttle is exciting and incredible but it wasn't as exciting and incredible as like actually going to the moon [laughter] um so I I think that it's it's a deep wells that people keep coming back to you because of that\nUh and that that like I think that there are plenty of stories to be told more in the here and now I mean I I think the robots and should get\nTheir do when I when we were talking about this I said they're all those robots we don't hear any stories about the trials and tribulations getting those rovers yeah and they're mad at other places\nYeah any you know what we also hear about any stories of any other countries in this space for ... there are so many other asks if there are so many countries up there\nRight now I mean there is a story to be told that the tweet about the Russians I think there'll be a\nAn epic story to tell about their chief designer and uh they're they're [noise] Boulder prevails and difficulties and\nThe space dog like a ... there's many ways to make her into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like um gravity and the marsh and those are sort of maybe imagining that kind of an alternate alternative to these sort of looking backward movies I think\nMaybe there is something to be said about the interest in space in general but I like to believe we're not just looking back worlds with imagining the future\nYour what are they talking about a NASA\nAh so what what are big project is actually trying to get back to the mood so that's a bigger Ryan that's the last programs and all of exploration systems ballot meant so you know really I think once we can start flying those flights are there will be a whole nother a crop of a story to be told\nAnd one of the things I'd like to see I don't think the general public really understands engineering and how all of these things take to develop so on a personal level I think it'd be great if if someone could figure out how to tell what it takes to actually get\nTo the flight ...\nBanned in Mesa, Arizona welcome to science friday\n... thank thank you my name's Ben and uh yeah I Would I Would think it'd be interesting to uh make a film about what the challenger accident from an engineering standpoint um they the engineers actually tried to stop the launching a\nAnd unfortunately that did not happen um and it and then in the affected them in ways that many people did though of course it affects shield the crew but oh\nI think that many of the of the engineers have a story to tell us well\nThat's a good point yeah absolutely I mean that's a ... that that will be an amazing story but um I I think there is a plan to make a movie about the challenger mission um but focused on the school teacher Christa McAuliffe but I imagine these\nThe decisions made or the day and the ... the day before the lawn which were critical will be depicted in some fashion in the movie we were all engineering decisions and uh\nI'm I'm and I'm sure it will be you know I'm crucial to understanding the accident Mm [laughter]\nUh you you mentioned the rhyme mission that wants to get back to the moon is is it going to be easier because of the lessons we learned from Paul\nIn order to know are getting to the known as just as hard today as it was in the Nineteen sixties\nI mean we know a little bit more we have an experience space of one draw from a but actually going to the moon mission is going to be justice risky it's just it's hard to do\nUm the amount of ah ... when Neal said he wished for more ... I Wish for more prop everyday as well um so it's not any easier getting to the moon and it is risky I'm the second time around\nI remember after the ... the Apollo missions were cancelled there were three rockets leftover we only went to San demus supposed to be twenty I remember going through Houston and seeing them lying on their side one lying inside as a home for nesting birds and everyone thought there was anything as sad as seeing a Saturn five\nWas the most ... it's in a building now and it's been restored I I I Know that has been when we just turn that's put back in the family building and send them back then in my own I mean\nBut if they if the avionics are quite out of date and control it anymore [laughter]\nWhen what's the schedule for that and do we have enough money and is it going to be going\nOut so we're working to uh twenty twenty flight for the first launch of the last uh and really the second lots of uh Ryan we launched them twenty four came for the first flight of her eye on 'em and that'll be an unproven flight we are going around the moon or to a different retrograde orbits little even go way past the moon about Seventy thousand kilometers on the far side\nAnd that will be a long mission that's really a shakedown all of the vehicle systems on SOS enda Ryan before we put crew on the next flight we were in progress we have enough money um and it's just a challenge getting their\nBack to the future if\nWe do that or I Want to thank all of you are for for taking time to be with us and it's it's gonna be the fiftieth anniversary next year it's really amazing and we'll all be looking forward to seeing them airing Kramer science editor mashable", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Brewster", "day": "27"}
