races can rehab bitter conversations about the issues that get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic logic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides\nTo green so passionately our guest is Dr Eugene Chang mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago her newest book is the art of logic in Indian logical world and uh [noise]\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners phoning in and first one Alex is from Chicago hey along a neighbor\n[noise] Hi there Hi there go ahead so up\nBy previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nAs a black male you know you might be doing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist system that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes to massage you fix systems unknowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to identify as feminists\nUm it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminist system and so I'm being able to see the fact that I can still be a male male experiences while existing at him and that's um and identify myself in such a way really changed my mind\nI'm In I thought about that that's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening\nHe's you know as part of the problem is that we don't see how we others see yes\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is that we often spend to you know trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed as he is\nAnd one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logical of used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analogous experience I have a choice\nSims do require map it requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect and their their view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think that logic does not require math that logic is in a way pauses math\nAnd these things have porous boundaries I mean we've constructed a lot of us official boundaries between subjects that bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me with logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician\nIn order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician or not\nWe'll talk about some from a current event so it would turn out to the artist topic in current events and then as voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault that good so judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether this should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process is at places tell me what you mean by that\nThat's a whole other our whole lot of different\nParts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because lots of people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence and the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison ... and things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence there is a paradox because some people say well we have to ... ... someone innocent until that\nUntil that proved guilty and the thing is that if you have an accuser\nAnd an accused personnel let's just say that you as a woman and the accused the person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the man on the woman both innocent at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and Salafi have studied paradoxes for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes by shifting levels or finding that things are at a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of preview\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support WC I at Cape and islands dot org\nWorld and so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen does happen I'm happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we kept\nThat so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so having a false accusation\nUm would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but ... isn't proved to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or\nThe the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we have somehow prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWith prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault over time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo and then ... them is a a question of black and white thinking\nAnd this happens a lot wet people get into arguments in extremes on so many of our arguments at the moment ton divisive because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between I'm so there is a an argument's around saying\nSomething like um you are making everyone into a rapist or watch one that professor land but said on his book that that we are ... just spin the bottle crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale I'm Better off things that are\nAs bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape which\nIssue of false equivalence says and ... arguments where you can take that false equivalence and then you can declare it while you're saying everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying\nOr your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind just by accusing him a sexual assault which again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\n'em ... finally um that's the question of knowledge and ... hypotheses which comes up and scientific testing law where you have to decide what you'll default position is and then say you say in the absence of other evidence I'm going to take this default position and I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind\nAnd the thing is that in\nA court case and the trial it's very important because we're going to punish somebody badly for something so before we do that we should be very show that they deserve to be punished whereas in the case of a Supreme Court\nAppointments than what we're doing is we're giving something something very good and important and so we should be very sure that they deserve that very good an important thing and in that case one might argue that that that situation could be negated by one bad thing happening whereas in the case of a trial\n[noise] boom\nYou're listening

and the Newark test had been racking up the planet count\nBut this week astronomers writing in the journal science advances brought the whole thing to a new level describing the possible discovery not have an exoplanet\nBut at the moon orbiting an exoplanet to be specific\nKepler sixteen dashed twenty five dash be and his some four thousand light years away how did he do that well joining me now to talk about the research is Alex T cheese and and it sets graduate research fellow and the department of astronomy right here in New York at Columbia University\nWelcome to science friday thank you very much for having me first what what moon is this where it give us a little thumbnail description\nSure yeah so it's a a moon as far as we can tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainty but as far as we can tell it's there\nAre a large moon about the sons of Neptune actually which is sort of strange um orbiting this plant called Kepler sixteen twenty five be and it's about eight thousand light years away as far as we can do\nSo but so what is the relationship of the size of the moon to the size of the points\nSo the size of the planet is ah about the same size as Jupiter it's a little more massive as far as we can tell a and then the moon is uh like I say about the size of the mass of net\nBut even at a pretty unusual well known that big well it certainly unexpected right where if\nThe moon's in our solar system ah we've got a lot of them are they're all ... significantly smaller than the earth so uh when we spotted this we said to you know this is what it looks like about the size of Neptune that as sort of a raises new questions for people how how do you get something that big it's a little premature to say how common are how\nThis is potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things ah but ah you know you could argue that because it is the largest you know because it is so large a it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see is so large\nYou know because we think of our ... and we think of another body hitting earth and knocking out a piece of writing doesn't look like that and this case uh yeah\nIt's fine you know there's there's basically three mechanisms that we think we get the moon's from an impact their scenario like how we got earth's moon ah moons coalescing out of a disk of material swirling around the planet in the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons of Jupiter and Saturn Uranus\nAnd then finally a capture scenario like Neptune largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ...\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads a little\nBit yeah and we like it when they scratch their [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but that detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nSure yes I Will ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far is using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view\nIt blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the star like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks out some of the light as well in addition to that uh we try to see\nThe gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet\nAnd so that makes the planet wobble around a bit as it as it orbits the star and so sometimes that planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late and so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also\nA something ... folks are pulling on this planet that uh that uh we're attributing to them\nHey says that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they yeah well\nSo it's an extraordinary claim him as the famous thing goes Stordahl claim is a one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo long yeah uh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly one of the time so we're going to have to have a very good case you know their exams that I'm ...\nI'm an obsolete is the wrong word but they're all everything is always an obsolete by the time he gets built whether it's a highway or something else that makes some law well we should have made it twice as big what you're saying whatever am sure yeah you know so there's other\nTelescopes coming down the pike ... their people bidding right now to well the we've talked about a W first and then there's a\nA telescope called who've war than ... ... yeah that's a that's\nA I I don't know who's working on it that it's it's a ultraviolet and read an optical that's L. U. V. I. O. R. and I think so uh that they come up with great names for these things are so there's going to be some fantastic instrument stadium Estee will definitely be an an improvement on Hubble\nBut you know Hubble was over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it ...\nIt is All right so if this is a strange jar planet situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planted situation\nThat's a great question one of the things that I I'm always saying to people is you know they always come into question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems\nWe are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is that things going on here happened in a billion hundred billion mother places are across the Milky Way or it's this very uncommon chain of events that that led to us here and that of course speaks directly to\nUh the question about the origin of life for example uh so it's particularly since this a moon is raising new questions about how you get something like this it's opening up some new questions about the dynamic will histories of these uh a planetary systems and and the speaks directly to that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe topic of her new book ... squad one camera single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century our number eight four four Seventy four eight to five five I'm let's turn back the clock back\nTo that time period ... uh you have an entire chapter on catcher\n[laughter] what was so and then ... ... while you're devoted why read it I Know why why devote the tell our listeners and empire after I'd catch [noise]\nSo this is a catch up it's just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have this very twenty first idea for twenty first century idea of catch up which is kind of a sick tomato based ... but\nIn the nineteenth again it tended to be a kind of thin nasty a sauce with a lot of vegetable ways and that people would ... pumpkin ... people would\nPut tomatoes but they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called tower dies and then because the whole mess of it tended to kind of be rotten anyway they dumped preservatives and like sodium bizarre way\n... which that she's still with ... today and so this book ... because this kinda battle ground or food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair and in this case I really love the story because\nIt makes the point that you know not every business is evil and uh Henry J. lines of ah the Heinz\nFood manufacturing company took it upon himself to get preservatives that are his ... his products ... reinvented catch them so the catch up we know today was really created by Heinz\nAnd he did it so there was a lot of tomato and ... said that kept the bacterial count down and then he went to war a mean this was a battle between business and advocates and and ... business friendly government\nAnd all kinds of though he was a big believer in profit really pushed for say for products and actually sent his ah some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety\nThe things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food there were afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives I Want you to do something and catch up kinda catches all of that\nOut over the preservatives and get er and that was pretty fascinating\nBut let's talk about a Harvey Washington where I was a little bit more than ... the focus of your book in the ... squad um he actually started where people were volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out yes food safety ever tell us about that what the white ones in the ... yeah it was amazing\nIt's just crazy and you I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think as you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control\nBut what happened was he had been working really since we're about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know\nAt completely not able to move this forward politically\nAnd he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animal safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things and to human beings and so that's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment\nIn which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerous Lee and the deal was\nThey would eat three free meals a day\nSeven days a week ... and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and all kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time had to be adding capsules of the compound that he was testing at various doses from very low to very hot\nAnd so during the poison quote squat experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food he looked at bore acts which is a cleaning product he looked at ... which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but\nThey almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems and because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this is front page news all across the country you were food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life\nYou know create this poisonous quieter get from the bottom of the food safety\nYou know that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller ...\nHe and his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also night ten or a preacher\nOr the conductor on the underground railroad during the civil war\nAnd he had imbued his kids are with this kind of said some higher calling and and ... really I mean what was interesting about him was that\nHe took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never really been interested in from the very beginning and then he just starts feeling at a party spilling the layers of it apart\nAnd the more he realizes how at risk people are\nThe more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying we'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick\nAnd so he has the sense that\nUh the role of the government [noise]\nHang on travel golf\n[laughter] that could take a drink of water that aren't [laughter] there you go um [noise] he\nHas this very early sense of the role of the government when we say in the constitution promote the general welfare this is kinda how I said\nHe really means promote the general welfare and your everyday life that part of what we do is we stand up for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an advocate as much as a scientist and that's probably right\nBut he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually did that's the thing that one of the things I Love about the story it's a story of a single person\nWho drives the conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation on our way we think about food safety\nSo did he actually we're in we're in their laws created because of his crusade where did Congress actually put teeth and the FDA and things like that can be\nAngry I Am so after you know he's like battling always stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws passed then one was the meat inspection act and that was a\nDirect result of Upton Sinclair as the jungle and the ... the horrors and then about a week later the food and drug ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": "2018",
