world listen to this to worldwide rate\nHas nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent in the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section now\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is uptick what are the effects on mothers in babies\nAnd what into ... can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about the section rates globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner to get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number a four four seven to for eight to five five\nYou can tweet us at science fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy is an author author on that a Lancet series he's also professor of midwife midwifery at the Yale School of nursing\nThank you for joining us today alec enemy\nThanking a tell us the Lancet series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions that must have buried around the world\n[noise] well it does and and what we found was that over sixty percent of countries overuse C sections and twenty five percent under used to the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um ... socio cultural acceptance of surgery as a normative on thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with on women not being able to get a ... bird after they've had their first this area and so it's it's it's it's complicated\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the country's than overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough access probably are under using at the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about right about right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as this area and we're way over\nLast talking about over ... there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women are going to a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\n[noise] [noise] well I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted norm of this part of the culture in in Brazil\nMhm are there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the problems [noise]\nExactly and again that has to do with access and a wealth education\nUm interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this as area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because [noise] um ... is his area and is not a low risk\nUm surgery it is it's a major surgery and and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and that's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states who are increasing maternal mortality rate\nYou mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and why\nThey're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes\nAnd I think it's important to to stay at at the outside there are women who in babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nI Want to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be vice chair of quality in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr ...\nThank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um ... there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the due to do you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen has been your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... and the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have a delivery biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver I'm In our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions or a patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise and sit there and delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and\nYeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make the recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nUm it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics so there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health of fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\nOn the progress during labor in terms of the cervical diversion I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on a labor and delivery unit that might put some pressure on us to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery but it\nSusan I'm as not to ... to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that I'm teaching some families do see I um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes\nA highly what's your reaction to that\nI Would completely agree with her that the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having invention of birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her\nAnd her physiology two two best achieved imagined a birth\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Lauren welcome to science friday [noise]\nIra thank you You're welcome good

World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help\nHelp us look at decreasing says Erin's and and one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on we free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was a a associated with improved outcomes increase the including\nDecreasing C sections and so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states that study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midwifery across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest sea section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent of births are attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives and then they met that with outcomes and\nUh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives so that's not causation it is an association type steady\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um we knew how to model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their mid why the midwife knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nUh Tony going you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went for forty twenty nine percent in a in a decade what [noise]\nWe had a woman I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says area and I'm first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make\nSurgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people you see a heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific modern definitions for progress in labor\nA old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than newer more modern data really prove to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and um and do the out of them for ... back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor misspoke here at the Beth Israel and I would do if you were always from cell phone down here in Boston and so there's there's so many method that to the hospital you go to determines moralistic you'll have a C section Ina\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on Syrian delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\n... to the thrill of it to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies may gone beyond versus a typical delivery did did you study that you're\nW ... members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming assisting member visit Cape and islands dot org\nOr where wealthier we'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more per se is area and to really um level the playing field in in any in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one in in time or perceived to be in time [noise] mhm\n... you're you're ... may issue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the U.S a where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery then is his area and delivery\nHowever the hospital does and that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients on and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here and the U.S [noise] uh the reimbursement is greater but it really goes more toward the hospitals side because of the length of stay let's go to Sharon in Somerville mass harsher\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications from Crohn's disease and so I'm I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I tell people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends think things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just asked if he could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that end of his questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't\nYou know push the baby out that generally and and that was really upsetting to me because\nMy two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me and I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those at the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions\nAnd I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um\nLove to hear the response or I got about a minute or Tony are only would I Would I Would completely\nAgree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed

which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it was sequenced we suddenly had this tool kit that we can use to answer all kinds of\nReally cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to honeybees bumblebees have a very different like psycho right out of the colonies gets started\nFirst honeybees there\nAlways social uh there's never a point in their lives in the life of a honeybee queen where she's living on her own\nBut bumblebees are different um they have an annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony and he's queens will leave the nest on their own and\nThey'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own and then in the spring I these queens half to crawl out of there over wintering spot and start their own ness so they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though their social insects and they have queens and workers\nAnd this sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle to\nYou and you weren't brought a new show us with ...\nI did yes you'll notice from the get go that it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees\nThey actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that the ancestor to both of these groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor with social but since that time you know a lot can happen and a hundred million years and so\nThey've all these differences and today they look really different the way the ... the way that they live\nTheir ... meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we turned to confuse the two kinds of bees is having equals lifestyles all the time really well to be to be\nRight well I consider honeybees is a ... and ... my lab actually studies ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focused and the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals and economy contribute to forging ... home\nYou're brought ... with ... German\nHarvest France from I'm here in California which was supposed to be on the sidewalk ... slightly larger than what you are a little bit longer there but yeah and of course she than the ones you can see on the sidewalk and ... why are you interested in the\nCities area and the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between ... so a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they worried and how quickly they call their friends to food so another thing\nThe ... and flip it over I was on its\nHead those who would just like that that's a cast of a an an Smith yes use their like pouring plaster Paris it's exactly faster flowers from Home Depot how far does not go down as just the whole length I\nKnow that's just the top part\nAbout six eight inches long it looks just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did when ... um which is that type of metal that when you heat it up like water and sewage slows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to the around and break the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then moments where I said he was the these there's a lot of ... that determines how the they can go\nTo our house there's so much focus on queen bumble bee wonder about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones so the the drones don't do too much for the colony itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's important to point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this or whether it was really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen there was something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumblebees do we how do you make a queen\nWell for the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sort of trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point\nUh but we think that there are probably also factors in regard to just like there are and honeybees and bumblebees and people just have to look for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from the audience what start right or were there on the right side yes go ahead please\nUm my um my mom\nIs allergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the knees and use it\nHer when she gets styles that is a great question I'm allergic to bees to back that offers\nYou work with and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies\nUm that's really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the terrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were stung by being me too\nI'm does a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the venom and there'd be interact\nInteresting ... requests yeah great question are no longer answer also live in big groups were the queen Howard there was different from something like a honeybee\nWell there's a lot of ... and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities and differences in first of all many of them live underground raise bees will and\nPut their hives inside of fame three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example the honeybees in some species of ants will relocate from one site to another so honeybees will go and look for a new nest site in ... the way the shape of the\nEntrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ants will off there's a species of ... that will look for certain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places or there's some similarities in some differences\nI think the sizes and one thing there is some species that have been calling these that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands in even up to ... million so the leaf cutter\nCalling you can have two million individuals\nAnd just been talking for Halloween I Know that you also studies social spider borders social spiders\nSo upset about more than forty thousand species of spider is only about forty species are so our social um and what happens is they are living groups and the reason we think they leave in live in these groups is so that they can capture prey that's larger than them and so they offered lead build these\nAnd from members of our founders circle taking a leadership role in supporting WC AI including Joe and run to chronic our thanks to you into all of our members for the

now chooses to go without insurance like I don't have it back\nIt's absolutely terrifying I'm Mary Louise Kelly healthcare in Arizona's mid term this afternoon on all things considered from an area coming\nAt four o'clock on W. ca I\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the civic arts plaza in Thousand Oaks California\n\nDid you sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard\nBut I Am not the only one I can see from the audience said his takes about sleep in the United states among other countries aren't great fewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole ... but it is our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules could there be jeans at work\nMy next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep in how well we recover from last week and he's found one of these genes in a surprising place\nNowhere near the brain welcome back there came a Paul associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles\n[noise]\n\nRight you need to get seven hours of sleep a night that's what the usual requirement is\nYes for um the majority of long term studies that are looked have found that if you get significantly less will significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night than that doesn't work out well for you in\nTime in a lot of trouble yeah because I get sick if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that that\nWell how can I add in all honesty I'm going to fix our crowd myself why do we need to sleep and the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what\nWe do know is bad if you don't sleep adequately bad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first are where we can sort of short term\nSo many of you may stay up to my it after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just made me up with the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow your memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do those tend to ...\nMore longer term effects if you continue Bailey on a regular basis not getting enough sleep\nThan their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at a higher risk for infectious diseases\nAnd it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke and diabetes now mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping ... interestingly enough I think our genes are pretty much involved in everything we do uh what what does it what about sleep\nWhat our genes control would it be the hour that than the number of hours of the quality what when one of the genes\nDoing that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about genes is you're not just talking about\nHow genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment so I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works\nI'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role in timing sleep\nOn the time of day you prefer to sleep time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day or sleep most of the night on what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restore the properties of sleep the things about sleep that\nPreserve your memory and your ability to focus and the things about sleep and improve your health the genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused\nOn now what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep or not in our brains they're not in our heads\nWell they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain they're expressed in the body\nThe gene that I focused on in my most recent study beam on one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which we have um had a lasso ... one is what's known as the clock gene you have clocks in every cell in your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as the clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it\nIt has to be in and dodging the timing mechanism like gears talk to my students about deals on the ... most of them don't know the clock is our [laughter]\nSo I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time I have is an output mechanism that allows you to tell\nThe body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep\nOn for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we've looked primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain and most of the things that Dr your sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks in the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain and tell your brain how to sleep more importantly\nHow to recover from sleep loss\nAnd when do you mean have to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your terms that's how the hit on if it goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep process these works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more if you get too much sleep will go and the other direction\nThe clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature in the evening it says to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes\nThat are as like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from now so when you say the clock is that the\nThe circadian rhythm we've been talking about the circadian clock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and it would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours a shouldn't overhear\nYes I had a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an ... [noise] how might that play with the a clock that you're speaking of itself\nSo napping as it is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they win by yourself than an hour and I do have one of the great things about\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org and\nMost of us to have children or have jobs I live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap\nAn hour's usually was about recommended but I think from a half hour to an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much and that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by\nClock mechanism um especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons\nSometimes between one to three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now oh gosh I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't blame them either directly right that's why I Try I understand but that just moved to where it let me go to the questions on this side yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep ah ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the day because yes [laughter]", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "19"}
