this year's winners of Julia Child a war and when we last left or her when they were telling us about the first years of their seminal LA restaurant city cafe\nFor the French food was actually in the parking lot because they didn't have enough [noise] and then how they got is we've figured as knife fight for Susan would take a trip that would change both they're [noise] they're going back to tape up security [noise]\nAbout two years neither of us had had a break more than one day a week for ages and Susan I'm decided that she can take a trip and go to India and uh I'll never forget it the night before she left we were having a little kind of\nLike a fake fight or a race thing we were racing to see who could bona leg of lamb clicker and that's how it's worked out like yeah I think I Want she didn't win because I like through my arm up in the air as in a gesture and she had her knife in the air and I cut the tendon in my finger\nSo I had to go to the hospital and get a cast and she was like oh maybe I Can't go and I said no no you got to go you got to go\nAnd so then there was me Jose Luis and we're talking every thing for those two weeks while she was gone but what happened is when she came home she was gone how to put about you know four or five Indian dishes on the menu we did ... ...\nCory and did a shut needy and right and\nIt was really like immediately we just incorporated into the menu so it was all these rustic French things and a bunch of Indian\nThing to do that and and I had been so inspired over there by\nAll the flavor profiles and just that it was such an interesting 'cause he's all vegetarian with it was the place where I I was staying on an Asher more a friend of mine lab so I spent the whole time in the kitchen with\nHis cooks and all the women were you know not allowed in the main little kitchen that basically we're just three holes in a cement block that you know you put a fire underneath that by\nAll the women were out on the porch grinding spices making all the different bread than it was so inspiring that it just was something I felt like we have to put these things on the menu and then\nAbout a year later Mary Sue took her first trip she didn't cut me right before she laughing [laughter]\nShe took her first trip than to Thailand\nAnd had a very similar experience\nYeah my uncle was there and he I landed up so I could work in the kitchen of the hotel where he was and they had a big very very authentic type of fate and the woman who cooked it was actually the cook for the king and queen of Thailand for ten years before that\nAnd she didn't speak any English and I didn't speak any time but you know we got along immediately and we cook together all day every day for three weeks and then same thing I came home and we were\nYou know time Ellen salad and Chinese sausage salad entire red curry duck and I'm scallops and oh my gosh we have pictures that are just amazing\nAnd so then you know that our menu them became had cats to lay and then duck red curry and then potato budget with mint cilantro chutney and then you know put those are and so it was a very\nMixed like that on one day the rigatoni that we bought from a person who made fresh pasta and delivered it came and it was like three or four inches long instead of the normal inch and a half\nAnd we were like what happened I said oh we had a problem with the cutter and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd then I you know we were we this is houses and and I kind of work together we're in the kitchen going oh remember those chicken breasts we we've got to use them today no matter what we can't let them go another day okay well let's just\nLet's make a sausage out of that chicken breast with a lot of ... stuff it into the rigatoni and then I don't know what do you think of let's just try with cream and parmesan anyway that Reagan Tony became like a signature dish that everybody ordered and so we had to tell the ...\nAnd literally it became one of those favorite dishes and some of the inspiration comes that way of trying to like get rid of things that we think we need to get rid of\nAnd other ... other inspiration comes from people that work for us it someone whose mother made something when they were growing up in a tiny town in Mexico like our measurement bananas\nOr you see something in the market I mean when we first decided to turn city cafe into a little tiny Mexican restaurant called border grill we went to Mexico for three weeks we drove around and a little tiny VW Bug and we\nYou know asked a trillion questions of everybody we could do find and but if we'd go to the market and do something we'd never seen before we would buy it and then we would take it and ask people what it is how do you use it with this chili that I remember we discovered ... chilies and we'd nobody nobody knew what a Chipotle he was more or less a chain of restaurants but it was Nineteen eighty five\nYeah yeah I mean we didn't you know that that first trip to Mexico we stay well our little kitchenette city cafe was myself and Mary Sue ended in a dishwasher\nBut then eventually we hired like a ... student who came in you know probably wanted like Eighteen dollars now is that no no no we'll hire you for like five dollars an hour or whatever ... whatever minimum wage yeah [laughter]\nAnd I said okay so he came to work for his name was ... and we loved him and we ended up going to Mexico City and staying with his parents\nIn their home and his mom took us every day for a few days to the market this is our first chip and we'd like bought everything that we didn't know what it was and come home and cook with her all day so it was how we started to learn about\nMexican ingredients and and we fell in love with this cuisine and then we did this driving around where we just like\nAte everything we wrote our first menu in the Volkswagen bug when we came back we opened up and when we opened up with this you know Mexican menu\nAnd literally we had to take our notebook out like with the pa new Joe's or with the ... as we couldn't remember what they even were you know called and so we were constantly looking at are now but but that was sort of the beginning of border grill that was the beginning\nYou know I keep thinking about the timeframe or this is in the early to mid eighties this was not stuff that was happening and shut the restaurants and you know people starting today have such a different frame of reference from a and I think ... probably grew up with you know\nYou're with their family and their favorite Mexican place so they went to an office all the stuff was built into so many American politics are growing up though right you know when we opened\nCity so the bigger version when we open city restaurant and it was and food that was influence from cities\nAll around the world ... we put a ton dory of and in and we got that ... or even from a owner of a Indian a hotel he was an Indian man we went downtown in a pickup truck and picked up this on fire tend to hurry up and so it's just\nRock clay that's been dry and it's like held together with elephant hair\nAnd well we brought it back in the back of a pickup truck hoping we wouldn't hit too big a bump so that it would crack\nAnd then we learned all about how to fire it and then we spent one day like fourteen hours where you have to bring it up to like\nTwelve hundred degrees we wrap their bodies so we could stick our arm in there because you had to keep rushing the sides with a brown sugar and mustard while in order to glaze it\nAnd we played Indian music and incense\nAnd then finally you know the night before are opening party and Ruth Rachel was there that night and walls we may we that night like at three in the morning we finally made our first batch of non uh-huh and you\nCan't even looked like a dirty ... kind of out of the oven [laughter] well interestingly\nYou talk about how different it is these days for young cooks I mean we had never gone through an opening right we didn't know what that meant you know and opening it was just completely seat of the pants\nAnd we were dead out of money we had to open because we needed some cash we couldn't even buy groceries so we had been in the kitchen with our health department or the okay for about maybe forty eight hours when we\nThat was a ... in student senator twenty Eighteen winners Julia Child [noise]\nComing up they had gone through their stuff ahead of time and had pulled out of boxes and tags and piles of things and you know to a

their career so their stuff actually goes into the museum's collection for the Immortal Life forever [noise]\nPaula Johnson is a curator at the museum and she joins us to talk about how she gets the good stuff he Paul a great to have high Francis\nIf you have a very cool part of your job and that is you get to go to all the winners of the Julia Child award and bring back something from them to display in the museum so I Want to know what\nWhat's that like I mean what's it like standing in front of someone who's going through your stuff and you know they're thinking\nOh man I'm going to be in the Smithsonian\n[laughter] yeah it is a cool part of my job I Will admit that\nIt has been different for each of the winter to tell you the truth [noise] um [noise] you know for ... and it was something that we talked about and then it led from one thing to another um if they list it was also very different and I was able to speak with him and his staff and\nI had of time and by the time they came back with a very wonderful list I pretty much knew that there were certain things that uh stood out [noise]\nUm ... donated a collection of menus and as you probably know he is an artist and these ... works of art and show both of course the menu items but also he has ... as well as photographs and documents and a few kitchen tools [noise]\nFrom Rick bail us uh we were able to collect his original field notes from his research in Mexico in the Nineteen seventies\nThey are just fantastic because he was a an anthropologist and keeping incredible notes as he traveled around different regions of Mexico\nAnd the field notes are handwritten and then midway through they are typed\nAnd he realized that he really wanted to type as notes halfway through the trip so he bought a little typewriter and he donated the typewriter as well cool I'm from Danny Myer we collected around his concept of enlightened hospitality that really shaped and and drove his groundbreaking restaurants in in New York\nSo we have again another document this notebook of his conversations with people that he was asking for guidance dividing Union Square\nIt's quite a diverse collection as you can see we're really looking at again the biographies of people and their particular stories [noise]\nUm this year I'm it's wonderful to have been able to go to Los Angeles and to speak with\nMary Sue militant and Susan vinegar about their you know their stuff but we don't really start with the stuff we always start with the story of who they are and um how they got to where they are\nHow they got into the restaurant business and what those early years were like what the struggles may have been what were the challenges and how did they land on you know this very successful formula that they have\nSo for me it really starts with the story of learning about who the people are what the big themes might be in their in their histories\nAnd then to show up and talk to them about what that might look like what is the\nKind of the the kernel of of their their own history [noise]\nUm so I was delighted to be able to go to Los Angeles at the end of July and to meet them in ...\nW UCI sustaining members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nAnd they had a pretty good sense of what we were after and had come up with some great material so what is it what is it the donor or do you mean from what you see it [laughter] okay that's where we watching\n'em we are in the middle of collecting this material I'm too big boxes I ride a few weeks ago and in one box was Mary Sue ... knife bag um that she her hacked\nFor competing on top chef masters when she did and twenty eleven and you know this is an object that we don't have anything quite like it in the collections yet and they're at all was um you know all beautifully arranged\nTheir six nights for the bachelor was chopsticks scissors Lester is all this stuff is very very cool and what about Susan Susan today\nYes well the two of them of also donated some of the dishes from their early restaurant a city cafe in Los Angeles and\nThese are just so special they're they're beautiful very colorful and they are um shapes that reflect the cuisine that they were really featuring in city cafe and uh so we have um a nice iced eight or ten pieces [noise]\nUm and to come to the museum we will have a chef's coat um you know Mary Sue ensues and we're very into color very early on and so we have a pink chefs coat I'm with border grill embroidered on the cough I'm which again shows how they're very\nCognizant of the fact when they are doing something on television that they can also show that border grill part of the camera angle on which is is wonderful [noise] um and then we've got you know the archives are always you know very very interesting to go through I mean there's paper and then there's paper and\nFor us there were these little notebook that didn't look like much but of course when you pick them up and you look at them and you realize oh my gosh this is their first trip to Mexico you know trying to really research some of the corner he roots of dishes that they were interested in for their restaurants [noise]\nSelf little no books like that neither one from India and for Thailand sort of cool and\nYou can sort of imagine as a researcher looking through this and\nSort of seeing the thought process of somebody who is curious about food traditions in other parts of the world and cooks and and people in other parts of the world and to then think about bringing that back for their restaurant in Los Angeles yeah\nIt's so cool to cause I imagine you know [laughter] so I think Twenty years in the future no Thirty years and the you know the people were going to win and then you're going to be like hey can you send me the text text me\nAt all [laughter] and you're in a row of tortilla but\nLet me out there when you're also doing though is you're going through essentially somewhat like as you said someone's life story through the objects that they have held and written in isn't an emotional process for them\nIt is kind of um and in fact you will see people bring this stuff out and then it's there and then when we come and we start handling it gently of course but handling it and and talking to them about it\nYou know that the stories are triggered and when they start telling the story the meaning is made a parent of what this object represents to them and their and their lives and what they care about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "city": "Brewster", "day": "20"}
