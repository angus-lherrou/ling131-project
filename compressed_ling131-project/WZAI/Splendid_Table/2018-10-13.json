examined me [noise] so I Want to talk to you about the subtitle of your book actually it's iconic American desserts so what makes a desert iconic American\nReally wanted the book to be a collection of desserts that the majority of us could say played an important role in our childhood so for me growing up in Kentucky sweet potato pie was a tremendous tremendously important desert that we always had around the holidays and that you know people just made in general\nAnd I realized pretty quickly that you know outside of the house not a lot of people are eating sleeping at a pie\nAnd and so that's not iconic it's a very American desert but it's not iconic 'cause there's plenty of Americans who you know born and raised here this is their country this is the culture that they love and they've never had that so I didn't want to be a collection of\nRegional desert so desserts that are important to some people but not others I wanted to be this celebration of all the desserts that connect us together costs\nHow did you decide what books qualified\nMaybe it's kind of like that um classic\nLesley great to have you here thinking or having the ... so I'm\nDying to hear the story about this pilgrimage in India but first I Want you to tell me a little bit about Caroline and that that area of India\n... is a it's a ...\nPost very near the tip of India and its tropical it's humid uh their beach towns and at this time of year it's very very hot and and tell me about this ... what are these women doing [noise]\nIt's a pilgrimage where millions of women\nTraveled to one city to cook a dish together\nAnd that simplifying on it a little bit um but it really is it's about devotion to one got us and they're traveling to the home of this got us and her temple and in city called ... and\nThe trains are filled with women starting a few days ahead of time who are all going to this place the fares are actually suspended for women who are going so they have a free ride\n'em and the women are taking with them a single bag usually they have a bad that is filled with all of the ingredients that they need to cook what's called ...\nAnd the entire ceremony revolves around arriving to the temple arriving to the city and everyone's setting up\nAnd what they're setting up our a makeshift hearth of three bricks\nA clay pot and some usually coconut bark for firewood and they set up all over the city so they're into how many women are you talking it's been about a million or two million I'm ... wow yes it's hard to hold on your mind thinking about what one or two million women look like and this year the temple actually reported that it was close to four\nMillion wow big year okay so they are all going to a single temple that's devoted to a goddess yeah that's the\nWay that they refer to her is actually called my mom\nUm she sometimes conflated with another got us and there's there's such mythology around all of this if this is what's so interesting about this\nThe Scottish she's an incarnation of a female deity usually known as ... collie and um she's worshipped locally by these women and she's seen as sort of a a giving figure but also a very intense strong and some times furious figure\n... so set the scene for me so you were there and there's millions of women are setting up makeshift hearth with three bricks right mhm and they're going to cook simultaneously mhm which is an amazing thought um and tell me about what they're cooking [noise] so\nThe morning that this happens um women wake up very early ah they wake up to prepare themselves they they wash their hair they wash the rice um they dress often and new clothing\nOutfit just for the ceremony um and then they all gather around the hearts that they've made the city actually provides the ... for the ... um and sometimes the pots\nAnd they they wait until\nThe signal from the temple comes and the signal is that um the priest and the temple lights a fire and that fire gets passed on from woman to women and then they're also volunteers running around and helping to light heart so all at once at the same exact moments all around the city there speakers set out\nWomen light a fire\nAnd they all start cooking\nSo was actually really incredible about this is the smell\nYou're you're walking around the city all of the smoke is all over the place and everything smells like burn rice and fire and coconut bark\nAnd these women it's Ninety seven degrees there sweating their smoke in their eyes and they're all praying they're all looking at their pots looking at the sky all in the same active devotion at the same exact moment [noise]\n[noise] yeah and they're really cooking so tell us when it's a rice porridge yes so they basically they start off they have a a clay pot over an open fire 'em they add water they wait for the water to boil\nAnd then they have this specific kind of race it's called Carolyn nicer red rice it's got a partial has left on so it has a right to you and they scatter rice into the pot usually in three handfuls\nAnd then the they wait for the for the pot to boil and part of the ceremony is with the pop must boil over to satisfy the got it so when you look around all of these pots are bubbling over this sort of steamy was beginning to be a rice porridge\nAnd they eat it then they do so they they spend time cooking it so that the rice gets soft like any rice dish would and then at the end um they add all of these seasonings and sweet flavors and it\nDepends on where the women are from some you know some women say that you have to ... because he is a a purifying a sort of symbol\nUm many women at gender there's always coconut there's always cardamom there's always\nA what's called ... which is an honor find plum sugar and uh at the end they they cover their pots once it's cooked they cover it with a banana leave\nAnd they wait for a priest to come around this can take hours instead of in the interim time they eat lunch they sit around and they rub each other's shoulders are they a nap and then when the priest comes they all get\nAnd they take off the banana leaf and the priest comes in scattered holy water over their their pot and then they're ... and this moment it's so beautiful because it's the thing that I've been waiting for a year at this as a sort of symbol feeding themselves feeding the gods getting their families\nAnd they all take us ... they taste each other's tongues dollar they feed each other and then they put the banana he's back over top they packed the pots away and they leave\n[noise] mostly it's such a

day 'cause it's a credibly beautiful but uh what should we talk about\nWell here's the uh we live\nIn a very hot place\nOr do we get a real like a nor'easter like eighty five degrees and that's what we put a sweater or it it's it's very hot and humid all the time so stuffed spoils really quickly we refrigerate everything and you know even refrigerate things like red wine and sometimes even salt not\nNot so much salt H preservation but just to get to try and and so we really are very careful with a store things and one day\nCain that friend that just came from Italy and he brought us a huge piece of prosciutto\nA huge chunk like three pounds something like it's like six inches by five inches by about four inches high a huge piece of push it was just my wife and I\nWe we love it when in fact we call it amongst all wrong and and uh we we do enjoy it but we didn't know what to do with this enormous chunk [noise]\nAnd so in in the midst of the party of my wife says why should we cut the what we should just put it in the freezer for now ... put it in the freezer and it's been there\nAnd ah anyway we have no idea what to do once we get frost it because we cannot possibly three pounds or ... before which boil and I totally committed\nTo your to your suggestions because this morning knowing it would be speaking to my ... pulled it out of the free ... is currently defrosting refrigerator\n[laughter] oh wow so you're okay there's no turning back yeah there isn't it [laughter]\nYou've got you've got the guardian not on the frozen preview though I see um this is an\nInteresting problem I Am honored than you would trust me with it I Hope I don't feel you have to say I've never actually had to deal too much with a giant fruit and block appreciated\nBefore that's a that's me neither one of ... in some ways a a blessing\nProblem now have to tell you given the fact that it was frozen in a home freezer I don't know how well it's going to do for us meaning\nIf my ... my questions to\nIf you flash freeze meats and things of that nature in a in an industrial freezer that didn't work because it freezes it so quickly that the ice crystals um stay pretty small but just like flash reason and they're they're they're\nIn the home freezer because it takes a while the ice crystals start to grow and they and they started to poke through the cell walls and so you may find that elite some juice and you may find that the texture when you when you bring it out is not going to be quite as um for more you know sort of to some as it was before\nOr maybe not as delicate that said\nIf it's not totally be frosted what I might think about doing\nIs if you have a a deli or if you haven't done we slice yourself if you know a deli nearby men do you consider running over there and having them slice it thin while it's still a partially frozen so ... license then\nYou know packages or however many slices you ... you\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nOriginally a fresh per se um but so I think about cooking with it\nThat's what I was going to ask dessert cooking solution because I thought the same thing would probably wants to Fawcett even if it was stuff that wouldn't be quite the same\nYeah I mean I Would think to use it in in in ways where maybe your wrapping it around something maybe your wrapping it around those piece of chicken you wrapping it around and the and then you can sort of ... it becomes a layer of flavor [noise]\nUm [noise] you can cut it into chunks\nAnd use it to do some vegetables it'd be beautiful with\nGreen beans it'd be beautiful with greens I'm treating it like a salty cured ham if you're if you're not in a position to be able to enjoy it and it's sort of like silky thin sliced a state\nYou know I assumed since sliced phase of it slices over it wouldn't be something\n[laughter]\nI Wonder even why even thought maybe it was singing the slow cooker and sort of raising the\nYou know I have never done that but I is that thing right where like freedoms another word for nothing left to lose\n[laughter] so hey try it and I'm\nSure someone in Italy with like you know rolling their grave when they heard someone done this to a procedure but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious 'cause all the flavor is still there for sure\nThe texture may not have all the flavor at all the beautiful cure flavor is going to be there so if you do that in a slow cooker\nI'm sure the liquid that comes out would be incredibly rich delicious\nUm it'll be quite salty so of course you you want to think about that one eating it you may want to you know cut up into pieces and use it to flavor a larger dish I'm set of cooking the whole thing but Henri ... you know in the in the American south they had these um cured hands that they do exactly that with\nIts cured it's air dried and then when they prepare it traditionally you didn't slice it indeed it than you took the whole ham and you would boil the whole ham and much of the salt would come out you might save some of that\nLiquid I'm used to I mean not like it would be incredibly beautiful you could freeze that and use that as a stock or a a flavor base for other stocks and then eat the meat\nYou know I think I liked the idea of cutting it\nIt you know it's a flavor an answer for vegetable dishes maybe sauces and things like that I I I kinda liked that idea in Argentina which is where I was born we have a dish called ... and one of the things it's like a big giant stew\nAnd one of the things you should do is put a big piece of pork belly you know not like not like sliced bacon square into which at them as a flavoring and as a kid I Would always fish for the entire pod looking for that thing to eat it\n[laughter] so it's kinda like that idea of mine on different names you're cutting it in half\nAnd using some of it for chunks for adding to the vegetables stews and stuff like that and then the other half slow cooking and see what happens\nYeah yeah yeah or if you cut it nice enough nice and small you can start that in a pan um you know render its fat maybe you can add a little more olive oil or or or other facts of the pan when they get a little bit nice and brown scramble some ... and that would be\nSo delicious yeah I don't you know I Would like to use the push you do with something that's maybe one or two other ingredients you know just really kind of feature that flavor 'cause I mean it's a beautiful flavor whenever you do with it thanks so much for listening all the way from black you but", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day":
