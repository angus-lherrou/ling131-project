people who live with her [noise] and loose with a chef\nWe're talking about the life of chef and writer in the ... and there's a terrific book called end the Lewis at the table with an American rich\nIt's a collection of stories and essays by all kinds of people knew her were were inspired by her work study her and truthfully it was kind of inspiration for our approach for the show using different voices and showing a sliver of what she meant to\nServe Franklin as a writer and educator was the person behind them\nHe so I think so much for coming into its a pleasure Frances so I Am really interested in how you got interested\nIn the work of a new Lewis I think we're both in the same boat that we never knew her personally we never met her a trait but are both fascinated inspired by her so tell me how you got to be that way\n[noise] I was introduced to her through gourmet magazine in two thousand eight when editors publish entire issue devoted to the American south and they built that issue around an essay that have been published posthumously written by the Senate Louis called what a southern and in this essay I\nMiss Lewis positioned the culture of the American south and the culture the African American south in particular alongside\nThe kind of work a day ... kitchens and also alongside music\nAnd literature and painting and other forms of art ... and for me it was this incredibly striking moment as someone who is interested in food in and really desperately wanted to get involved in work the food\nWas a really key moment in sort of seeing what it was like to try to put food alongside these other bastions of culture and to try to make sense of that and I never heard of that and Louis before that I loved cookbooks I Love cooking on but I I had no idea who she was I didn't know much about the American south I didn't come from there I grew up in New York\nAnd I sort of quickly realized I needed to know who she was\nSo I ordered some for books and I read them and sell in love with her and it was many years later that I was working with an illness is editor Judith Jones who's the editor that also published\nJulia Child in modern ... oh my gosh the list goes on caught in Rhode Island and yes that Iron Man Frank fan of all ages but I'm ... and really sort of the canon of American cookbook author is or English writing I should say ... and she published and the Lewis is most famous book the taste of country cooking in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd in interviewing Judith Jones enough work it became apparent to me that her book that you did with mess Lewis was a real hinge points for her but she turned away from working primarily with authors who are writing about Internet\nWas writing very explicitly about American cuisine and culture and very particular region within America\nAnd it for me it was a sort of stand up that starts to attention and pay attention moments in in Judith Jones as career\nOf what it meant and you think about the kind of mid seventies what was going on politically in this country and the women's movement civil rights Vietnam War it's come to an end I mean this really tremendous moment of conflict and confusion I think around our identity yeah what it meant to publish a book\nFrom the perspective of an African American woman about the American south of rural America and south and then through the perspective of home cook\nAnd then it just I think for many people who've come across that it was this really\nBeautiful piece of writing it was extremely political in its sensibility ... and sort of unfortunately direct a it was making a statement that it was not going to a gym down your throat and and you need it to kind of be ready to receive it in her on your own time and I think for a lot of people that come late many many decades after its original publication\nWhat do you mean by receive it and that when you say that came late\n[noise] well you know it's really interesting you can read the taste of country cooking and love it as a ... and sort of leave it at that the recipes are wonderful the pros is lyrical and beautiful at rights of of living on a farm in a farming community\nIn a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons the work of foraging of working in the fields of putting food up in the kitchen of eating alongside one another but if you read more closely if you look at the way the menus are organized as sort of holidays that are being celebrated like revival or emancipation day\n... this is a work of African American history in the American south of of really giving dignity to that culture as its own entity in a lot of ways that's separate from white American culture\nMhm [noise] so I\nI wrote a story about to lose a number of years ago and in my research ... called you up in and spoke with you and you inspired me to think of a lot of things that I'd been bigger before mhm\nIncluding but I think this idea of the face of the country cooking as being more with political work when you said it's beautifully written and it's very easy as a as a friend of mine put it to think of ms Lewis as or just a sweet old lady yes a sweet old lady writing about her time growing up in the country\nBut I was struck by how she position the life of black people rural black people in the early Nineteen hundreds\n... her her grandparents who are the people who founded the community she grew up in where in slave mhm they were freed slaves at once that's right\nThat story you'd imagine a story that was one of hardship and you know just trying to scrape by and and she writes about it like the most beautiful society the most beautiful community it was a life of beauty literally children are singing in the book yeah and\nI thought that was so powerful and so remarkable to say\nHey whatever stereotypes you have of us ... if you're not including the fact that we created this beautiful cuisine you started out the wrong that's right and that's a profoundly political thing it's\nA massive corrective and I'm just so much of what had been written in what continues to be written that the lights on the American south and black culture with in that large regional culture large series of regional cultures\nThat was one of just hardship and poverty and that even though these meeting communities that were financially pour their life was rich\nAnd and that included bounty you know if this had nothing else they always had food on their table and lots of it yeah and and and things that we think that's sort of still is luxury foods meets cream butter um foraged mushrooms as far as I mean this is stuff that people pay top dollar for now and this was\nYou know this was everyday food by virtue of the life they had created for themselves\nYeah like ... they're literally making souffle it in their kitchen literally yeah yeah that's right and there's also this fear ... to it too I think is so again maybe subtle and maybe I'm reading stuff into it that isn't that wasn't intended to be there but there's a scene I remember a small tropical hog killing\nAnd she describes the tradition of you know when you started the hogs in the fall and how they put up all the different parts and\nThere's this really incredible image of and they take the bladders out and they blow the butter up like balloons and tie them and those are the Christmas ornaments when they're dried like you know several months later it was like can you imagine like being that close to the guts like literally mhm and but also I remember reading it and the way she describes the hogs\nAfter they've been slaughtered ...\nIt almost sounds I mean the way she described in the hanging quietly like statues it's like that song strange fruit it's it's almost like a Lynch scene and then I found later that when she was young there was a black man in a nearby community to hers\nWho was lynched\nAfter he had talked to a white woman and asked her to help them with their ... yeah and I have no idea if that's what she intended to be\nNow you have this many years hence understanding history or hopefully understanding history as we do and it's all ... [noise] um the reality of it I I Can't help but notice and had those things in her mind certainly I'm honored she wrote them in that scene but\nYeah I think that's what I Am a leading to the sense that she was so unfair lynching and her ... you know that that there was incredible ... and what she present to do with\nWhether it was beautiful or difficult are often both at the same time\nUm and that she was going to say it sort of quietly and many people in New hurting her as being a fairly quiet woman she often didn't say more than needed to be sad sometimes she said nothing at all if she was going to open her mouth or put pen to paper it was going to be with clarity it was going to be concise and she wasn't going to dart away from her intrudes\nOn and then she was just going to sort of place it there and leave it there and and you can receive it you know for the beautiful find or you can read it for the difficult side or if you're ready you can try to find both paradox and that and I think ...\nYeah incredible incredible life thank you so much to her\nAnd my pleasure Francis\nSarah Franklin the editor of at the Louis type a table with an American average\nTeacher's food writing at NYU and she's also working on a book on Judith Jones is Lewis is legendary editor\nMm Mm Mm Mm\nMm\n[noise] one of the Lewis is deepest friendships was with another show\nScott they bonded over a commitment to southern food they wrote a cookbook together and for the last years of her life lived together\nSo after talking to lots of people about ms loses reached the world we also wanted to know what am I like to be sitting next to her in the kitchen [noise]\nHi Scott Free to talk with you a great to talk with you Frances services so fun to get to speak with you because we've been talking about ms Lewis and all these different angles and always different directions but I can talk with you about\nElse a moon of America's Test kitchen with the rest of the inspired by ms Lewis chicken and pastry Francis lamb and this is the splendid table from ATM American public media\nSometimes if I'm a little down or I'm a little bit sad about some realize what are you doing what are you doing sulking here pick up your guitar for God's sake and next thing you know two hours later I'm flourishing Arlen Ross from when I yeah I hate being bored with my own playing you know I got to play something new all the time\nI'll just say well I'm used to this how about trying a little you know\n... ...\nBy some different voices\n\nMake it a different regression\nMm\nYou're listening to WC a a local public radio for the Cape coast and islands\nI'm Frances lamb and you're listening to the splendid table the chauffeur curious cooks and eaters\nIs on the table was supported by ... online test prep for the ACT that's designed to improve scores students can get video lessons practiced questions and experts support online prep smart go far and enjoy the ride and the goose dot com slash ACT\n[noise]\nYou know Lewis was called the ... southern cooking so many times the words are literally etched into her gravestone\nSo no one disputes that on her but it didn't make us think [noise] you know she grew up with such a particular version of southern cuisine in central Virginia and we wanted to know more about that region so called on the corner historian Jessica Harris to fill us and [noise]\nPay Jessica it's also the\nLove we seem to be back brands [laughter]\nSo I Want to start actually um by referencing a story which you probably know but\nThere's a story where William Faulkner walked into the restaurant where an uh Lewis was the chef at the time in New York City caffeine that goes on and he ate her chocolate souffle\nAnd then asked her if she had learned to cook in Paris\nAnd actually and the sister roof told me no she learned to make a souffle from our mother so speaking of sudden his mother right here's this woman who was the daughter of an enslaved man who is making these exquisitely French souffle home\nSo really let me think like can you tell us about the black food of central Virginia back then 'cause that's not I think what a lot of people would have expected\n[noise] well I think there were a variety of things to remember I don't necessarily know what Mr Ed most parents might have done\nBut never forget that African Americans who were in service cooked and they cooked not only African American meals but they cook things that were eaten by the families were home they were in or two of them they were in service\nA much wider killing our repertoire\nAnd so did that Brett of cooking really mark this region are going to get in a way I mean my mother's people are from Virginia\nI'm not the same part of Virginia I don't believe it's been said and I never really look that up I probably should\nBut one of the things that I Know about my grandmother is\nShe just cooked a wide range of things I mean she was a ... term you know she could roast anything brilliantly beautifully not what people think of normally she made preserves um when I looked at some of them is ed ... early cookbooks\nThere were things that sounded like my grandmother's food but\nIt also comes out of Virginia's culinary history or with Jefferson being this\nBig Franco file and [noise]\nIs that what you mean well I mean I think that's certainly a part of it but if you think of you know the what are they called them in Virginia the F F will be the first family's a Virginia\nYou know if you think of all of those folks of that kind of an mutilation of European of that desire to be Patricia in of all of those kinds of things that were in effect\nIt really would be in effect on both sides of the racial divide Mm cue narrowly anyhow\nSo what are some of the differences in the southern foods that send to grow up with and what we I think more stereotypical you think of as being southern food\nWell I think they overlap I think the food didn't miss it and I grew up with because she lived in an agricultural seasonally inflict the universe was very local very local\nWe talk about the kind of cooking that she did which was very for one of a better term sophisticated mhm but I mean sophisticated in its simplicity the sophistication of ms and the food is that it's simple\nAnd simply beautifully done\nIt is about the manner in which it has cooked it is about the ingredients in his about all of that mhm now that inflict in various different ways throughout the south\nI'll never forget speaking with Leah Chase in New Orleans and Mrs chase simply said you know ... are picky about what they put in their pot [laughter] they are\nWhat goes into the various dishes African Americans have not always had\nThe ability to be as shaky or picky about what goes into the pots\nAnd sometimes then that makes for a different kind of cooking to the degree that you have a choice to the degree that you have the ability to the degree that you have\nVariations or things that you can grow raise all of that right the best of the best is what used or\nWhen those things go wrong when those things aren't quite as universal as one might hope\nThen you get other kinds of food then you get other kinds of cooking then you get that stuff that I call hardscrabble mhm you know my mother was Virginia My father was a country Georgia\nThat always played at the dinner table my dad was shuttling man the collard greens the hog law of all of those things my mother was the you know roast pork with ... and you know stuff like that so you get\nThe verge of right but it's always the best of what you can surf slowly\nThank you so much for talking with us today Jessica it's always a pleasure thank you for having me [noise]\nThat was Jessica the Harris author of many books latest hold my soul looks back\nAnd fun fact about her the national museum of African American history and culture actually called out her to define the different regions of flack cooking for there is a restaurant\nTony ... Martin is a hero of mine and full disclosure she's an author I work with but before I knew her I knew that she was working on a massive project a book called the ...\nIt's a history of African American cooking told through\nHer research through two hundred years of black and\nThey paint this picture of a cuisine that way more diverse and technical and sophisticated than the stereotypes of black fur [noise] so I knew that she must have a story about him is Louis we asked and he joined us today he Tony great to have it here [noise]\nHey Frank thanks for having me how how did you meet as\nYou know ours was a chance meeting many many years ago when I was a young journalist at the LA Times\nWhen you contribute to WC a yacht you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support doubled UCI at Cape and islands dot org\nTo introduce myself to her and find out what\nIt was that made her so special and it didn't take long for me to figure\nThat out one of us to you about her\n[noise] well you know I have to say that my initial reaction was clearly one of her physical stature I'm sort of like going on that first blind date right you have\nAttraction and you you don't know anything about the person um but she was so incredibly beautiful and statue west and so poised intelligent and clear headed and not to say that other African American women aren't that it's just that\nThat's the impression that she leaves\nIt's amazing because so many who described her as being regal and a half years later her middle name was in fact Regina right but it's like she was fated to that wow I don't know if I knew that a while\nWell you know we get stuck some times in in making physical observations but I have to say that given the work that I've been doing and how it started in my desire to find an alternative view of African American women in the food world", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "07"}
