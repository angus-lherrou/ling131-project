top\nThere's almost set a shies idea of having quote a good palate right it's as if what makes you a good eater is\nYou know the ability to detect the three grains of human in a recipe or that the tomato sauce is a subtle ... of ginger skin and sure yeah a sensitivity like that is all good but what I think having a good palate is really about\nIs just being able to talk about what you're tasting\nAnd you can put into words what you're tasting and I remember our producers would always say to us look you're tasting the food for the viewers so you have to tell us what it's like\nAnd I think you'd do tastes differently if you're thinking about how to describe it you look for a story to tell what's the first thing that grabs your attention\nThe thing about how the flavor changes if it mellowed out or if it keeps getting intense and then you start to think about other ways to describe the flavor maybe you think about it like music you talk about its rhythm more depth earth high notes and the more you do it\nThe more you come up with different metaphors and comparisons and ways of describing flavors and textures and the more you start to appreciate\nWhat it is you're tasting\nBecause now you've really spent the time and effort to really take notice of it so you know I'm not a restaurant critic but I play one on TV and I can tell you that you too can eat like a

I guarantee you the hosts goes survey says the board flips acid lights up and you take home fabulous prizes and that's because chefs are always talking about how the splash acidic vinegar is what elevates a dish\nAnd Michael Harlan ... should know he spent his whole career out chefs first as a cook himself and then as a photographer and writer and he's made himself an expert on vinegar as\nHe's traveled the world for them he infuses them and yes he makes them in his apartment or contributor shot a fever talks with Michael about bringing this restaurant secret weapon home\nHi Michael thanks so much for talking with us I don't think travelling to see how it tell us how your obsession with the world of vinegar came to that\nI think the same way most people make vinegar the first time a accidentally leaving a bottle of red wine out and open on the table but it kind of snowball into a couple of other alcohol and had a leftover quarter keg that I poured into a barrel\nAnd it turned into the best ... I've ever had in my life so definitely a happy accident it it is and now it's absurd obsession\n[laughter] now your book reveals vinegar to be so much more of our son the kitchen that we might realize so can you tell us about some of the main functions and cooking and baking\nVinegar as a flavor carrier is not just this overt thing that kind of punches you in the chest and makes you cough it it is a vehicle for a lot of other flavors to kind of co mingling coalesce so you know when you make a big red either two two one two or three to one ratio oil the vinegar um you're actually\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nIt is a really interesting part of cooking because as overt as we think it is is that is actually about the balance and harmony and a lot of other cuisines\nAnd of course in baking vinegar it's used in so many old fashioned baking recipes to react with a ... and says well\nOh absolutely that science experiment of baking soda and vinegar you know shooting up like a volcano or certainly is kind of like what Irish soda bread is a you know using that as a photo lab and\nWhat are the things I found so fascinating in your book is that you chose to organize part of the book by different cuisines across the globe give us an example vinegars that are unique to certain places and how they're ...\nI'm going to go chronologically like the book first I got to go to France and Italy Austrian Japan and back all through North America and in France or you know there's a lot of butter a lot of cream um and it's delicious because of those things\nBut those sauces have vinegar in them have some kind of a city to balance all that out\nYou find vinegar and Bernays you find vinegar in Holland days most of the master sauces but it's not necessarily the thing that we first think of as the primary ingredient and moving Italy I just got back from a trip or in the mail you remind me a region where ... is king\nAnd ... another thing is probably the most ubiquitous vinegar around the world now\nBut the amount that's made for traditional a which is the original boss amok vinegar\nWhich really wasn't exported to the states if not world until like the Nineteen seventies a such a small amount is me that a lot of people haven't even experienced it\nSo seeing that vinegar in contacts and seeing that his barely used as an application where you heat it up you know on top of a little age parmesan or strawberries or maybe the accent a stuffed pasta um\nThen in Austria I think quite possibly the greatest vinegar maker in the world lives in Vienna and he is singular in that he makes ... a tomato saffron red pepper a trucking Baron ... and\nAnd makes you things that are so linear and pure that I've never tasted a vinegar so expressive of its you know inherent self\nAnd then you have things like ... and an Asian cuisines\nThis was another thing that I had only really experienced you know ... ... ...\nMarkets but when you taste a real race vinegar it's kind of like taking a shot of ... or ... for the first time a\nThere is so much expression [laughter] there's so much tear war to it and raise vinegar can be the same way\nThere isn't just acidity there there is flavor are dependent on what kind of rice they use and how much is polished down on top of that you know the traditional Raisman or coma zoo as probably the standard the gold standard of rice vinegars in Japan but then there's the suit this red vinegar\nMade from the age ... and it literally turns almost black and ... wouldn't boxes before it's pressed um then there's ... from the south west of the key issue provinces black vinegar that's used more as a drinking vinegar than it is as something in common area practices\nHappening there are so many different flavors of vinegar and we know about things like say you know ... when you're sleeping in art and vinegar but what some of the elements maybe some of the more scientific elements that give vinegars there distinct flavors\nWell then there is nothing more than four to six percent a CD acid and solution and that solution is\nWater so kind of like wine there all these\nVolatile Esther as these aromas that are carried within that solution\nSo that's what you're tasting and that's what you're smelling so when you're making an infusion you're calculating whatever that aroma is in that solution in pairs with a CD gas it and you know kind of goes through that olfactory motion of tasting smelling but vinegar or a is often the sensation before it's a flavor\nSo you said on your palette you you have that you know feeling of brightness of lightning it makes you celebrate a little bit and that's when it hits that's when the flavors get picked up so like I had been saying before it is a carrier but the thing that it initially does is open up your ... experience those flavors\nThat's right our tasting and testing team has dove into all of us regulators that are currently out there and there are a ton of options for the home cook\nAnd they actually pick a winner which is called the jewel circulate her and it's small and it's sleek and it is incredibly accurate it's really wonderful and about how much is the jewel so the jewel is around two

thank you what we're supposed to talk about\nAbout a year ago I went to my friend ... challenge that beautiful liquor Fraser and I was so jealous I couldn't stop talking about it my friend got me well I think a little ...\nYou got me the Fraser and that they make something with them\nA problem with I don't know what to make what am I experimented a little bit I made chicken legs look right there I made some guys like oh God that's really all I Know how did you and I would love to be able to use the lord shall off you know if I guess\nOr so you got as a gift a big cast iron and an animal casts arm praise or about what size\n[noise] um I Would say probably watching ... pretty large\nOh big you know we got a big oh yeah oh cool and then\nYou have some cats aren't cook cuts which was like the basically the little mini brings it was right and how big are those are the semi shape so and I can\nOkay so what's those I have to say they're really cute like they're really adorable um I think baked eggs are shuttered eggs or you know something like that really kind of they're just so pretty in there and honestly I don't own a type of pot because I'm a I have\nTo be honest at home I cook a little bit more Neanderthal English so I um [laughter] so I don't use them a whole lot\nBut I think yeah something like that like a single serving of maybe like a if you want to do like a spoon bread and they are or like you know do on the side I'm at a really nice dinner or do for like a breakfast or ... if you're doing a beautiful little baked eggs with a little bit of cream and there may be a slice of two of country ham and just sort of\nLow heat in the oven to sort of gently bake\nThey're just so beautiful that way and you take off the top and it's just such a pretty presentation ... um but you're twelve or fourteen inch breeze or not they were talking because that is a really fun ... requirement to have [noise] I think for that\nI Want to talk to you about in general what I think that kind of hot tubs really well so what I think his beautiful about like a big cast iron an animal brains are you saying a cast iron so holds heat really well\nAnd I think people want to usually think about that in terms of like oh that means you can crack the heat up and and like get like amazing like hardcore searing action and there would you certainly can but for me I think what's exciting about that is that it can actually hold heat really evenly when you're cooking at a less intense temperature\nAnd so what that means to me is if your searing say you know short ribs you want to do some brave short ribs or if you want\nOr you want to do something like um like a pork shoulder you know like a nice sort of like heartier cut of meat\nI think what's great is you can get that thing hot but only like medium heat or medium high heat instead of having like wrap it up to all the way high you know what I mean\nAnd you know get your oil in there and get your proteins like pat dry with paper towel season them lamb and they're gently and what's really nice about that as you can get such a\nMore intense or like a deeper seer is maybe a better way to describe it and the pan holds that heat so well\nAnd it you can take Fifteen minutes you know to get a good see her on all four sides of a short you know like really take your time with it and you get this really beautiful crust the you know it doesn't burn it because you're not having a over such a crazy flame\nBut I'm just really get that Syrian nice in deep into the ... does that make sense\nYeah and that's something I didn't really get that that piece of equipment that I associate it with stealing or breathing are no longer not smart see things more like ... ...\nYeah and what's really awesome then though is once you get that really nice dark seer\nThem what you do is you also get you know all those great sticky brown bits on the bottom that haven't burnt so then you continue to use that to a Braves like you said this do and that's when you add your liquid you can add you know beer or wine or stock or you know whatever using and it just builds so much flavor and then you put it in there and put the lid on put an oven\nAnd I just think it's great for that kind of cooking it looks beautiful when you pull out of the oven and you can take the lid off and just sort of a write in the pot 'cause it's just going to be such a cool rustic beautiful dish what a gift\nIt's also a good one of those yes it's like [laughter] it's like oh I gave you this thing and now you're cook food I get to eat out of it too [laughter] oh yeah it was it was perfect for both of us the\nTruth will enjoy it I'm so glad to hear that you got the gift that you want to\nThank you thank you I'm excited to eat it All right let's now go was movie you're making it yeah absolutely thanks for the call thank you\nSo we have a question from an anonymous call her\nA hopefully it's not because they're ashamed of their question but ah so this gentleman bought contraption to make zucchini noodles and he wants to learn how to cook was ... noodles like noodles they turned out machine when he does them any really prefer them to be more ... um I don't know exactly how this gentleman's cooking his zucchini noodles but I think\nMy first reaction is to say probably what you want to do\nIs cooked some in\nHe because what happens is when you have like you know it's still ... they're going to look like beautiful linguine or whatever but it's still some teeny and zucchini a cooks really fast\nAnd get soft really fast and if you have a big pile of it in a pan then what's gonna happen is you know this stuff on the surface little hands cooking and getting soft and the stuff in the middle is quite cooked yet so would I Would suggest is divided into small batches maybe just a handful at a time and get your pan ripping hot\nPut in some nice oil maybe ... whatever you want to do whatever the recipe is and just give them a quick tossing them hand just until they softened up on the outside take 'em out start over and just do that until you get all you can you cook [noise]\nAll right so a little while ago we asked you all for your
