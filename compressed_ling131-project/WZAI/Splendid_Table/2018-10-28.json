a year ago I went to my friend ... challenged beautiful likely that writer and I was so jealous I couldn't stop talking about it my friend got me well I think a little ... the joke and then my birthday this\nYear he got me the phrase or an upset because they make something with them\nA problem with I don't know what to make with them um I experimented a little bit I made chicken like look right there I made some bake I like oh God that's really all I Know how to do and I would love to be able to use them more and show off you know if I guess\nAre so you got as a gift a big cast iron and enamel casts arm praise or about what size\n[noise] um I Would say probably eat our toilet fourteen inches pretty large\nOh big like a a big oh yeah oh cool and then you have some\nCats aren't cookouts which was like the basically the little mini brings it was right and how big are those as a semi shape so and I can\nOkay so what's those I have to say they're really cute like they're really adorable um I think baked eggs are shuttered eggs or you know something like that really kind of they're just so pretty in there and honestly I don't own a type of pot because I'm\nA I have to be honest at home I cook a little bit more Neanderthal English so I um [laughter]\nSo I don't use them a whole lot but I think yeah something like that like a single serving of maybe like a if you want to do like a spoon bread and they are or what you do on the side\nI'm at a really nice dinner or do for like a breakfast or ... if you're doing a beautiful little baked eggs with a little bit of cream and there may be a slice of two of country ham and just sort of low heat in the oven to sort of gently bake\nThey're just so beautiful that way and you take off the top and it's just such a pretty presentation ... um but you're twelve or fourteen inch breeze or not they were talking because that is a really fun to be the requirement to have [noise]\nI think for that I Want to talk to you about in general I think that kind of pot does really well so what I think is beautiful about like a big cast iron enamel brazen what you're saying [noise]\nEighth cast iron so it holds heat really well\nAnd I think people want to usually think about that in terms of like oh that means you can crank the heat up and and like get like amazing like hardcore searing action and there would you certainly can\nIs that it can actually hold heat really evenly when you're cooking at a less intense temperature\nAnd so what that means to me is if your searing say you know short ribs you want to do some brain short ribs or if you want ... chicken and your was your the skin or you want to do something like um like a pork shoulder you know like a nice sort of like hardier cut of meat\nI think what's great is you can get that thing hot but only like medium heat or medium high heat instead of having like ripping up the all the way high you know what I mean\nAnd you know get the oil and there and get your proteins like pat dry with paper towel seasonal um lamb and they're gently and what's really nice about that as you can get such a\nMore intense or like a deeper seer is maybe a better way to describe it and the pan holds that heat so well\nAnd it you can take Fifteen minutes you know to get a good see her on all four sides of a short you know like really take your time with it and you get this really beautiful crust the you know it doesn't burn it because you're not having an over such a crazy flame\nBut it'll just really get that Sierra nice in deep into the ... does that make sense\nYeah and that's something I didn't think about that piece of equipment that I associate it with stealing or raping are no longer not smart see things more like ... ...\nYeah and what's really awesome then though is once you get that really nice dark seer\nThem what you do is you also get you know those great sticky brown bits on the bottom that haven't burnt so then you continue to use that to brave like you're saying this do and that's when you add your liquid you can add you know beer or wine or stock or you know whatever using and it just builds so much flavor and then you put it in there and put the lid on put an oven\nAnd I just think it's great for that kind of cooking it looks beautiful when you pull out of the oven and you can take the lid off and just server right in the pot because it's just going to be such a cool rustic beautiful dish what a gift\nIt's almost like it's one of those yes it's like [laughter] it's like oh I gave you this thing and now you're cook food I get to eat out of it\nToo [laughter] oh yeah it was it was perfect for both domestic\nSurfing will enjoy it I'm so glad to hear that you got the gift that you want to\nThank you thank you I'm excited to eat it All right let's now go let's go you're making it yeah absolutely thanks for the call thank you\nSo we have a question from an anonymous call her a hopefully it's not because they're ashamed of their question but ah so this gentleman bought a contraption to make zucchini noodle\nIt'll like noodles they turned out machine when he does them any really prefer them to be more ... than say um I don't know exactly how this gentleman's cooking his zucchini noodles but I think my first gut reaction is to say probably what you want to do is\nCooked some in smaller batches than what you're doing over higher he because what happens is when you have like you know it's still ... they're going to look like beautiful linguine or whatever but it's still some teeny and zucchini he cooks really fast\nAnd get soft really fast and if you have a big pile of it in a pan then what's gonna happen is you know the stuff on the surface of the hands of cooking and getting soft on the stuff in the middle isn't quite cooked yet so would I Would suggest is divided into small batches maybe just a handful at a time and get your pan ripping hot\nPut in some nice oil maybe ... what if you want to do whatever the recipe is and just give them a quick tossing them hand just until they softened up on the outside take 'em out start over and just do that until you get all you can you talk [noise]\nAll right so a little while ago we asked you all for your secret ingredients let us know what are the things that you use of you and we might have never thought to use and we have Erica on
