welcome to studio three sixty\nThank you so this play is about the great actress of the second half and the nineteenth century in the early twentieth century a server and heart played by the remarkable incandescent Jennings here\nAnd the central stories about her insistence at the height of her career Eighteen Ninety seven\nYes that she wanted to play hamlet yes as a middle aged woman on the stage and everybody is skeptical of that idea\nOr end she wants to play rewritten to strip out the poetry and let me I Am certainly there's a lot of the bottom I Am and make it more like talk yeah and uh and focus more on I guess the action\nYes she was somebody who is really known to be as sort of electrifying active presence on stage\nAnd she wanted to play hamlet that way and she felt like the classical stance or the poetry stood in a way of action which in fact it does I Do so we're just spent\nA year working on this argument but I wasn't sure are watching the play that you bought her arguments because as she says it it gets last like what how dare you want to adapt Shakespeare in that way I sort of stand with Sarah and a lot of\nHer arguments just quite a brilliant woman and a lot of the things that you argue is not like I did sort of lift from her own writings um so you have written a according to my research uh twenty five ... players I've actually written thirty eight thirty I yeah I but it it's sterling Carol ...\nAn ounce of my time Shakespeare were thirty seven I catch up um but that's one of the year\nBasically for your you know ... plus dozens dozens of episodes for like twenty T.

I spent an hour in her talking to him about that very subject the terror of finishing can't\nI I went back to graduate school and got a PHD in Victorian literature and the theater and now I'm really glad I did I you know I'm Glad to know the things I Know I'm Glad to have spent the time I spent studying\nThe editor studying Dickens you know I mean that was back before melodrama was used almost only ... as it is yeah it you know was the tone it was a very popular form of entertainment everybody went I became fascinated by the fact that it was a\nA culture of theatre goers you know that the theaters were huge and that also that it was a place that all classes came together to watch these plans and how was then a melodrama different from grumble the score was called melodrama because everything was musically scored almost all the way through\nAnd it was highly um expressionist African gesture all a there was a kind of depletion of psychology and language which is what people know when they look back or if they find these tax they think\nYou know it doesn't have a natural language anticipated movies was trying to be a movie or and they were they were it was silent movies are silent movie existed and also I think you can actually draw the line straight from victory melodrama into silent movie and into German Expressionism and\nThere's a kind of ethics sized do a lot of the stories that I I find really\nPowerful and it's very stories centric yes and and your work to restore or do you do feel like oh I ... I feel like and ship with this because I care about story and you know well there's a lot of theater\nThat's very stories centric you know you've heard anything about ... you know I think there's a

sometimes I mean I go to see it and I think well okay\nUm I certainly am a big fan of back at you know the music colony and a deep heart\nAre are things that I respond to a so it's not like I Need a big story to be satisfied in the theater um but uh I Do believe that the action rises out of character and story rises out of action and that those are profound truth\nI'm In that great plays a written on those truth ah and I don't apologize for I'll go to my deathbed um insisting but\nThere are people who actually criticize your work for being too accessible well I find that mystifying do I
