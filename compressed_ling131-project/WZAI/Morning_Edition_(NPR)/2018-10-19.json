campaigning bin Laden\n[noise] um the original plan was to have um\nMore than two thousand and five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament candidates of all all flavors uh and philosophies\nAh there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of concern and worry\nPartly because of threats by the Taliban which has now come true well and partly the widespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be massive fraud so you've seen a lot of positive uh campaigning a lot of new fresh faces a lot of enthusiasm but also a great deal of\nOf worry a an an an anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting in Kandahar Province really large important problems the voting will be delayed for a week but there's no question what is possibly going to be any different a week\n[noise] right and we don't know that obviously this is a a measure of taken on an emergency basis um just to to sort of calm things down and I'm kind of hard to very large province which is just lost\nIts police chief its intelligence chase and the governor has been gravely wounded um there's a huge security vacuum people are very nervous and worried so I think this is obviously a measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously decision will be made later on I I Would think and hope that that elections can be held there because it's a favorite

devastated and in shock and calling back into the covers I knew I didn't have the luxury of doing that because I had hundreds of Latino students at my school that we're going to be terrified but what what was going on they were worried that their parents were going to be deported\nAnd some of their parents were she told me only making her students more nervous\nAnd it definitely has an effect on

Inskeep in Nineteen sixty five when President Lyndon Johnson went to Congress to propose the voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered and the vegetables are not prohibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration\nAnd in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is going to jail All right here's our first listener question\nThis is ... heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five however laws changed since the Supreme Court granted black citizens the right to vote and wait for the ... barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration and\nAs the century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late Nineteen the early ... centuries a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was aimed immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nWhat about the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens' well of course\nBlack men were given the right to vote and the fifteenth amendment in Eighteen Seventy but at the Jim Crow laws and the south effectively\nStripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of rights of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineteenth amendment in Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registration frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nOr we have a couple of questions about current controversies my name is Rachel ... men from Shaker Heights Ohio why is the candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a candidate but I assume\nThis is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp\nWho is the current secretary of state and this and thinking about refusing himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies the lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place was the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy pigment chart and\nAnd I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me and I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWell they're complaining about it just has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law which does require currently residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and pointing icy irony that the nation to original residents are being questioned about their residency\nAnd very
