EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed\nFor President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel it's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressmen from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection\nWhich President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world trade sources and the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lump sum shelf ... filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world's best whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six countries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd oh it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're probably are global sales had been out\nPacing your domestic sales wow and just to just to be clear on that fact that you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the ... but yes they I I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a nasty and the EU agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nAh we don't like any options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase tears were taxes no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people you've converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back\nWhich means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so the lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nRepublicans a lot to death um when you have conversations with people do you run into people who are having conflicted ceilings\nAh [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue yet\nYou made an issue like an election yeah it has to come up I mean Congress and bar has been very helpful to us in the past few months he said the meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how did the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows will probably means Kentucky or he will note for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes ah\nIn in he he told us he understood exactly did this with the sushi could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks ... federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States I'm like you know highly David sandwich announce it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in American if he wants to sell you better make jet\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been ... yeah I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinker so that we converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and from a price standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose them for generations spirit\nGregory of Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage damage from hurricane Michael ... Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable rather than non functional phones made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster is\nJust a ... mile\n... works and the fried division of tower held a Florida homeowner's insurance company over the weekend he caught a cell phone signal near Panama City there were still places it wasn't safe for his team to travel\nFor the situation like that and look at it\nIt wasn't just buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas of lost a generation of timber poultry farms are hit pretty hard and caught industry is just devastated\nChris Chandler isn't adjuster with alpha insurance and Alabama he's been working in Houston county\n... debate it last week and a sixty seven hundred mile per hour winds just blows it away but last April source of income so lovely\nEarly estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says the insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so it's good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now the communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler in Alabama says the damages upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers and like everything ... obviously that's not going to happen when\nYou're when you're you're talking to people that house was destroyed all their belongings showed pictures no amount of money is going to get an image backs of your of your patients that are passed away so that your child first birthday\nWhile some things are lost forever he says communities are already working together to start to rebuild Neil Diamond asking NPR News\nThis is NPR News\nAcross the country prison discipline comes down harder on women you can get written up for not closing your doors you've written up for jumping on the phone without permission and those low level infractions can have severe consequences like more time\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be a perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a simple majority gives you almost absolute power to again sets the agenda and get bills across for\nThat will greatly affect the willingness for some who had been at it for a long time and I was ... and whether maybe they should retire or not\nCancer things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nThink there will be miserable and voted there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be over because what if the Democrats take by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the\nSpurts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere will be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty eight or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrower majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nThink forty two on this Monday morning thanks for joining us for MORNING EDITION coming up on the marketplace morning report housing market is showing
