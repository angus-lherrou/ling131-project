Kavanaugh's uh her story is that a cabinet exposed himself to her at a party when they were both in college\nDemocrats as opposed to Republicans Democrats wanted a more in depth look at those allegations in for the FBI to kind of follow any leads are witnesses that might spin off of those so\nDemocrats have also increasingly talked about Kavanaugh's drinking um since that could have

about his reporting earlier this week can you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of there is a crisis and you meet this network of mothers\nYeah that's right I mean it was a it was quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was that um they are very very big you know there were very tight group loss of solidarity very to time and women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us there was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about ... ... as well which is kind of common to

three hundred and twenty children most of us children\nProbably died very soon off the bus or a few of them are ... chest infections through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand um there are children who are actually doing pretty well I I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most as\nThey they were very mixed group of children
