treated as\nThe least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as\nEffective in the courtroom for my clients unless my client stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase bail amounts and in many cases makes private communication
