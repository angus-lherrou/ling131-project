I'm Noel King more than me is a charity that aims to educate and protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nFollowers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nLiberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on the streets selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water street when you're free to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its undercut the mile or had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story that will really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets I think that the individually but taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is ... why did she start this organization\nGetting my there's a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of gift community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand of six on on evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued their relationship with the country and she started the project the first registered in two thousand and eight\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kicked him ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that well she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was a man named Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\n[noise] I never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of disorganization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point also being part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide\nYou know the so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked when he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in their equipment the girl said he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my other and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was doing [noise]\nWell that's something that we ask ... and something that we've reported their responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my allowed an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview but that same year in twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something on the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV rain [noise]\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formulate revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nHim or potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says you know where are your schools\nClearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we have from the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community the sense of\nA lot of people that are feeling that something's gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on and the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're living as well up more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since his story was published Katie my lawyer has temporarily stepped down as CEO of more than me this is NPR News\n[noise] Florida has some of the toughest building cars in the country but certain areas are exempt from rules to protect them against storms like hurricane Michael\nThe garage doors shaking hands like somebody's trying to get in and the inside your was shaking I knew the ... at that point because everything was\nOne case was a seven year old

within a few days Evan complained of severe pain in his back and legs he became extremely lethargic and went downhill quickly\nHe lost total control and both his arms and legs you know one minute you have the healthy head and the next minute your kid is totally paralyzed it it it was beyond horrifying to us\nIt's not clear what caused Evan sickness and the CDC's Nancy ... says unfortunately the cause of this condition is still unknown\nI'm frustrated that despite all of our effort we haven't been able to identify the cause of this mystery illness we don't know maybe at higher risk for developing them or the reasons\nHe says given the rise in cases the CDC is escalating its response and consulting with a variety of experts to fold the mystery they do know that some kids who get it have also had viruses such as enter a virus\nAnother possible risk factor is West Nile virus which so far there's no common pathogen that links all the cases\nDespite extensive laboratory testing we have not determined what pathogen or immune response\nOr the arm or leg weakness paralysis and most of these patients\nGiven that the symptoms are similar to polio a disease that have been almost completely eradicate it nothing you pointed out that this is not polio\nRight now we know that polio virus is not the cause of these ads on cases CDC has tested every specimen from math and patients none of the best in us have tested positive for polio virus\nThe CDC says despite the increase in cases a FM is a very rare condition affecting fewer than one and a million children but she says it's good to be aware of the signs and symptoms that Ninety percent of those affected our children there are some cases in adults\nWe recommend seeking medical care right away if you or your child developed sudden weakness of the arms and legs\nAnd those are the CDC can't give any specific information about what's causing a FM\nNothing ... says it's good to take general precautions\nParents can help protect their children from serious diseases that following prevention steps like washing their hands thing up to date on recommended immunizations and using insect repellent to prevent mosquito bites\nIn the case of Susan coin son Evan he's healthy again he was treated with steroids Andy was an occupational and physical therapy for Eighteen months\nAt a fully recovered she has regained all

the recipients of this year's peace prize both sided her courage\nShe refused to accept the social code that requires women to remain silent out of the shades of their views is to which they had to be subjected to\nFour years ago as ... street fighters enslaved thousands of women and girls in Iraq many were repeatedly raped and sexually abused in other words\nNot him rod was one of those women she was only Twenty one years old at the time and from a tiny but ancient religious minority groups they use ET\nYesterday people into their money and\nThey just on a simple life they they can they can leave we any group in Iraq in even habit and they are they're very ... these people in the state yeah they just want\nTo live in in peace and fixing\nTo feel safe I talked to an audience brought in NPR's Washington studios earlier this week it was her first full interview since she won the Nobel Peace prize with the help of an interpreter she spoke mostly in ... which is her native language about what she now hopes to achieve\nUm diminishing vision we had set it over and over that it's important for us the justice is done\nOut of the six thousand UCD women who were abducted by ISIS we hope to see at least one ISIS number who did this to one me as a woman to be punished for the crimes they committed against gives me the women and we hope to see them in court in public\nI think it is easy to see winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of combination or end of a person's career you've you've done what you said how to do\nIn your case at twenty four years old that is clearly not true you clearly feel like you have a lot less to do what is next for you after winning the prize\nI'm twenty five to twenty five ... and ...\nAfter I delivered our method and we have as a community delivered our message that we would like to see the reconstruction of our homeland infringe are take place and to provide security for ... said that they can go back and we would like to see this never happen again not get any other community or any other\nAre you angry about what happened to us in the ... a ...\nI can just simply say I'm angry because of that word only will not describe how much we have suffered but what I can say is that we are right we have the right to speak about this we have the right to deliver a message\nIf anger doesn't quite capture it what is the word what do you feel every day\nOr what chemicals to showed him ah you know like I said what makes us feel good at least is that we are delivering a peaceful massive die we are not delivering a message to hurt anyone when I meet with students and the president's for anyone\nI speak about what happened to us and I deliver my message with a clear conscience that I advocate for people\nDuring our half hour interview not humor odd seemed at times pretty shattered but also strong she says that strength comes from her UCD identity she calls the rape of using the women and the murder of UCD men including many people in her own family a genocide\nShe wants these atrocities to be classified as war crimes but even after winning the Nobel Peace prize she's not sure if that's going to happen and she sometimes finds herself frustrated\n... sometimes I feel that my message has not been clearly heard that that is not my fault because I feel like too much is going on in terms of women being victims and it's not the first time and certainly it's not the last time\nAnd perhaps every year a woman someplace in the world or groups of woman or thousands will be victims of sexual violence or terrorist groups and so I feel like this is not new to people and it's not going to be the last time and people have become numb to this kind of news\nI'm your mother your mother was killed by the Islamic state and I wonder when you think about her now\nWhat do you think she would think about everything that you've done what do you think she would think about you having won a Nobel Peace prize being the

for being ... and for being older women I feel like they will be\nProud proud that\nYou are twenty five years old you've just gotten engaged congratulations in your life is not what you thought it was going to be just a couple of years ago what kind of life do you want for yourself now\nLook ahead upside mutton huh yes we have got engaged but it's still difficult for me to deal with all of that so

into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what set more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its undercut the mile or had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts bubble make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually by taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie ... why did she start this organization\nKitty mother's a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of yeah community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on on evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued their relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kicked him ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that well she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia or demanding Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also being part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nWas heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the courts\nA group of power according to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and and when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my life had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nNow my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right [noise]\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who have contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nHim or potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in the court those who actually were willing to bring a case they were retested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had from the charities leadership that there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated but I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points\nIt's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nIn Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community you have the sense of\nA lot of people have a feeling that something had gone wrong in this and this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has not stuff flew investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we are also process for credit thing these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since his story was published Katie my lawyer has temporarily stepped down as CEO

variety of experts to solve the mystery they do know that some kids who get it have also had viruses such as enter a virus\nAnother possible risk factor is West Nile virus which so far there's no common pathogen that links all the cases\nDespite extensive laboratory testing we have not determined what pathogen or immune response caused the arm or leg weakness and paralysis and most of these
