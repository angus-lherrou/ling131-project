Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to\nBasically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right that enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do\nBut Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach and so she realized that thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world well you know by\nUsing evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any in\nNo enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies are in development that

all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nMcCarthy's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans a threat and the huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert account a flash they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear\nAnd MacArthur didn't want to believe this because he wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he sweat this information under the rug\nWhat was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name as general Oliver Smith realize that\nClimate he was very fresh and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen on the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure\nNone of these troops were prepared for fighting in these kinds of conditions\nYou given incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots\nOn you know this is Hector kept Retta to receive the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night he may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nThe Marines in parts of the battle we're out numbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never killed a man before he'd never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded\nTwenty thousand factories are chosen reservoir slog than thought through weighs sixty miles to the evacuation portable no [noise] no but I think that they held off two hundred thousand [noise]\nThe first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops retook North Korea and the country's remain divided today the

to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're going to have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevail do over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she rejoined her family and and made it to the south lead\nBy ... survived the war and emigrated to the United states

President Trump and everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand and Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a war could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting

that's coming up and up Fifteen minutes stay with us\nBreaking news comprehensive pro but listen carefully to how it's being scribes\nOver with sexual assault allegation Supreme Court nominee Brett

Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the cabin our case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social\nTV has turned his sons or any potential witness for victim is um let's say tainted\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing that's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing\nRebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nAbout trauma informed interviewing as saying just because they might have difficulty answering the question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that their line it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in that case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation into case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... told through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this ... but\nThat kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin Kaste NPR News\n[noise]\n\n\nUp on

you take the beaches away because of all the sharks that are now inadvertently terrorizing human beings you've just taken away the two things that as a kid\nThe border from a shark attack has put the question of the seal population front and center as the increase in sales is connected to the increase in white sharks who hunt them but Andrea Bogle mommy and investigator at who we and the chair of the northeast Atlantic cod consortium says the population is still rebounding and I think\nPart of the issue is we it and then all of us aren't quite sure what to do with this wildlife in our back yard and how to interact with them and we we don't know um it's a really new phenomenon here\nShe adds that Massachusetts is not the only place in the country to deal with a large seal population on
