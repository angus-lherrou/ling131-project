Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury\nTears in a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what\nHappened to her ... has been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThat moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at\nSome of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the inter ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats\nTogether and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week\nAnd of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers\nAnd then meet you [noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger being laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example\nWhat historically was so threatening about women's anchor well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out our condemned it in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment I think\nIt's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long when in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class\nWho in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq I think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience or the reality\nOf the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks over the past ... years\nAlthough we have to say there are plenty of women who support Calvin all women who are indeed angry because they believe that this is a character assassination by the left so is women's anger only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future\nRebecca Traister is the author of the book good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger is out today\n[noise]\n\nThis is NPR News coming up on MORNING edition of the world Trade Organization says it's running out of judges to hear appeals of trade dispute if the rules of\nThe game

regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in arrest and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney rifling says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact of police stop search detain\nArrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people and that the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse or there's various factors that they use risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of the nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect

unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way have a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now there isn't such a huge wage differential\nThis is a big departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support for the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom in wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact

three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that down says it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules
