from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow a human rights abuses at uh in in another country um to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm you see what he's been saying about the north Korean Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier are presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist and Turkish soil or I mean

'em in a consulate abroad in not in American allies caused flip the broad by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured it what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and on the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur visa V.

take advantage of a pretty good relationship um you see what he's been saying about the north Korean Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be held to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting with President pollutant in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore\nUm look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed\n'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies conflict brought by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured it what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's\nHe's acting beyond the pale is significant it on the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur\nBe that'd be Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially because Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together\nIs the government known for intimidating their citizens who live abroad that the surprising in some way\nUm it again it's it's gotten worse certainly um but he's been threatened before\nUm you know he was forced out of his job um he was defending a lot of his friends who are opponents of the Saudi regime\nOr he has a lot of friends in the United states in high places but there's no question that he was considered to be a real problem for the Saudis the Saudis over reacted to the Canadians on the Canadian government took umbrage at a Saudi behavior\nYou will remember of course a just a year ago all of those Saudi princes that were detained\nIn the Ritz Carlton there were some reports of torture when that occurred it and stop the U.S Saudi relationship from being extremely strong and again I just point you to North Korea I mean Trump expressed his love for Kim Jong il and was by far the most criminal behavior

traditions involved\nThis time else but hey an alley Brelo talk about putting up the harvest and have this passion nurtures relationships and different ways to honor the bounty first you'll hear from ... alley\nMy grandmother was a cannon\nThem one of my grandmother decided she was done cooking a few years before her death at Ninety seven she gave me her recipe book and walked me through each one to make sure I Would remember that traditions here's my grandmother by\nAlthough ... came down from my father's family the plumber family green tomato pickle the only way I can describe the green tomatoes pickles was that if you had a beautiful slideshow roast beef\nOr a good piece of steak all you needed the side it was some of that green tomato pickle\nMy grandmother taught me to make green tomato pickles in the fall this time of year just as the seasons are starting to change and an early summer making strawberry jam with my parents brings me home to Maine every year\nA few months ago a good friend moved two hours away but we've already seen each other four or five times because our relationship was built on food and every month or so we're getting together to put up peaches or can salsa or go blueberry picking or ... a big batch of kimchi\nI think a lot of putting up the harvest is about those relationships family and friends\nFor instance I'd love to learn how to can I've read about it but it's not something I'm doing because I really feel like I Need to learn it from someone else on the other hand it's also nice to know the farmers I have a couple of friends\nWho raised chickens meat birds and the other week I ended up with fifty pounds of fresh carcasses bones for short money because they weren't going to use them\nSo I got to make stock all day lots and lots of stock for my freezer\nI Love taking it day to do something like make stock or Kim chi are jammed my mom strawberry jam takes an entire day to find a day at the right time during strawberries season and we all have to dedicate ourselves to stopping and making jam on that day\nSo many people's lives ours included are fragmented and for me it's both challenging an incredibly important for both my pantry and my relationships to find this uninterrupted time for food processing\nIt's almost an instinct to put up food when I feel especially compelling this time of year when the seasons change for me I Love the process like making all that stock it's good work it's satisfying in a comfort to me to have a freezer full and ready to cook with [noise]\nI also like to put up the harvest in unexpected ways in places like syrups and oils vinegar and liquors binds using those things with berries tomatoes chilies are herbs lemon grass or ... cooking with a bright blueberry vinegar in the

means or how much in terms of quantity you have to make I discovered it can be just a little bit like a quarter of this a pound of that and there's so many ingredients to choose from like that dry
