good morning the billionaire George Soros says one of several public figures who've been mailed what are believed to be pipe bombs this week\nSoros as a hedge fund investor and philanthropists who donated to causes many of them progressive around the world and we should note that the open society foundation which he founded in Nineteen Ninety three has been a financial supporter of NPR\nDirt SARS has a lot of enemies in politics he's been a target of conspiracy theories from the right Sebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents\nAnd other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nWell the whole phenomenon of the pipe bomb or business surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that somebody was to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wanted to attack that I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is\nThe single most important norm politician\nI'm spearheading a progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen thirty to well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary a set of his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation in this country and he survived by separating from his family and I think that ... explains a lot about the focus of his finance or in his politics and they live\nAnd he left hungry at Seventeen\nTo go to London and from that he went into finance you moved to New York he opened\nOne of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful stock market trader so that by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties and nineties\nAnd tell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\n[noise] well I'm In the nineties a specialty was a currency peg than looked unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England couldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark\nAnd when the person's right or the pound collapse or us made enough food for sure\nAnd chaos when did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIf the gun in his native Hungary and then in other Eastern European countries where his ... he had a clear\nPolitical puppets which was to build for lives and so he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties on words but the switch came in two thousand three when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War there once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on demographic get out the vote courses\nThat was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick if you are being attacked in the major and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the media was slurring me because it's sort of stars and his allies have put them up to it\nWhy does George Soros and particularly become seen as a shadowy figure hiding and talked to is it just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as Saturday you can't expand it rationally birth actually is so that's called the open society Institute He's very open about it he published a figure as a about where that donations do so I think it's hard to escape\nThe suspicion that the critics who say he shot every I'm a ... on a long tradition of anti Semitism\nWhere Jewish finances are portrayed as the shattered me figure to manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's\nA fairly good indication of that tradition\n[noise] well what do people in his native hungry think of Soros\n[noise] he was a hero or early on in the transition away from communism things have tonnes more recently because of the anti migration populist nationalism that has taken over the country\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of several books in a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations thank you so much to\nPresident
