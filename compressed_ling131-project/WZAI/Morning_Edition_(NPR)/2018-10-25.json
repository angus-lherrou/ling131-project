mostly down overnight after a bad day on Wall street\nA hundred points today Japan's Nikkei index fell more than four percent the hang saying index and Hong Kong flipped by a full percentage point\nBut the Shanghai stock exchange was stable and this is unusual because China's stock market has fallen by thirty percent since January and its currency has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years\nNPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nGood morning Noel I saw a thirty percent talk for ten of stock market sounds pretty darned bad what's going on\nWell China's economy has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble and through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from\nAn economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U. S. much of the country's retirement plans\nAre invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edits weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well what's interesting here Noel is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing years ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that\nThe u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast China is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation that's the last thing China needs right now\nSo if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like this the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a compost I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy in my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands die to work\nOut the trade war with the U.

credits distance the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon carbon markets in the past\nAudit double counting nobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting and to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNot a company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is\nBig promise disrupt everything eat those is that it's just there's a quick and easy solution that things that sticks climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nThe call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause as watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the party that problem

market\nIn a typical C essay or community supported agriculture program a member gets a lump sum of money upfront to a farmer and then in return get the ... bag or box of selected food usually once a week\nIt's a decent system that supports local farms and it's changed a lot of people by their food though sometimes you come across the sea is a farmer like rusty Gordon\nFor almost Thirty years rusty has seen it all including what works and doesn't work and he's come up with some different strategies that are very much his own\nYou know I worked for what will farm for over Twenty years\nAnd I ran the the operation and see essay and stuff but it was a kind of a Richard system there wasn't room for error and you couldn't take extra she'd be take somebody else's stuff\nYou had to come your one day a week and you know in some time you couldn't show up or you forget or something and so it was a there is a tough system for sure you know it was good because people really wanted to support agriculture and be part of a system like a C essay\nBut even when I was doing it back then I knew that it just wasn't the best system I didn't think it was the best system just because so much waste as too much ... ... people not happy with what they were getting\nRusty point about waste struck a chord with me it's the main reason why it dropped out of the essays in the past there was either too much food for my household or it wasn't what I really wanted and I didn't plan well enough\nWhen rusty started ghost island farm in West his very six years ago with his partner Sarah Crittenden they recon figured that typical see as a model\nI think our format the way we do things is great and it's it's a little bit unique in the way that I'm a member countries exactly what they want so they're not bound to take anything and I think the key to this whole thing is that the zero waste that we have we don't have any waste\nAnd when a member I Want something you know it's because they want it's not because they have to take it or they feel obligated or you know they might try they might not I think people take what they want and so you know they'll come back soon because we're not flooding them with a bag of stuff\nIn full disclosure I've been a member of ghost islands yesterday for a few years now and one of the things that I like is that rusty doesn't use any chemicals and he sprays only with water\nYeah I Would never use GMO uh treated seats for sure\nEvery season rusty had his favorite vegetables that no one else that he knows of is growing on the island\nUm the ... the broccoli Lisa we grow that ... has always been really popular and um we grow a lot of that in the fall and that's coming along and that's one of the one of the hot items for sure\nHow do you cook it [noise] um you cook it like you cook any leafy green or any broccoli or and you you know it's um basically it's a unlike broccoli Rob which is in the turn of family there's the true broccoli broccoli reef and so it's a little hardier very thick very green so you stir fry it can have it any way like like any of the greens\nThere were other reasons besides food waste that may be reluctant to join another TSA especially goes dialing farm I think it was his hers yeah rusty drives a hearse in fact he's got two of them\nI Know it was definitely a big problem I got that I got my first tour is uh maybe I think over ten years\nUsing it you know on the farm and caring for for people to see because I knew that that would have a lot of people have a problem with that but the truth is my pickup trucks kept breaking down in this this gold hers are lasted maybe I don't know ten or doesn't pick up trucks over a few years start always find myself using it because I had to\nPoint of view I use
