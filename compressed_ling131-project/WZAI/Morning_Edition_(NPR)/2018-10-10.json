Nashville, Tennessee he says his medical saga began a decade ago\nIn two thousand eight I went in because I was flying in is with the un ab fab euro and uh he\nBeat mob but and so I wanted for knees to help me so I better\nBut after that routine knee surgery Langford developed a lung infection which sent him to the intensive care unit he had developed sepsis a life threatening condition sometimes called blood poisoning\nAnd all he remembers from his delirious weeks in the hospital was a near death experience asked song drinker I asked a somehow\nOn the other side of a river\nIt looks like there was a lodge a larger profit who's miracles included resurrection of the dead his mother leader says at one point hospital staff were so sure he would die overnight they didn't even bother to pass on his medical chart to the day shift\nAnd the thing that's amazing is his top looking to ice and he is like being aware of what we were saying and yet then not knowing and not remembering any of that I Would say it ... we were at the rehab are bad for weeks\nNow a decade later Richard Langford says he's still struggling to work its way out of a ticket that's physical emotional and cognitive

efforts to understand and treat patients like him this is a huge problem Dr ... an intensive care specialist heads that effort he says post ICU syndrome effects thirty to fifty percent of all patients who are in the ICU due to a medical emergency even younger people\nI mean you have somebody coming into the ICU with a previously ... very well working brain and they leave critical care not being able to have a good conversation they can't balance a checkbook they can't\nFind the names of people at a party and they get very embarrassed so they are socially secluded in themselves are patients tell us what a misery this form of dementia is\nIt permanent it's permanent in some we've been following people for over ten years now from the brain ICU study which we did hear Vanderbilt and many of them a decade out still have elements of the dementia\nOverall he estimates that a third improve a third stay the same and a third end up on a slow decline for many the mental damages akin to a traumatic brain injury re Alzheimer or even sometimes are farmers itself\nThese problems are linked to the degree of leery um people experience well in the icy you usually says\nEvery day you're delirious you have about thirty five percent increased risk of this dimension so if you do the math on that three days of delivery him you got a almost a sure thing that you're going to have some elements of the dementia\nHe can't say exactly why delivery of leads to dementia but elite has develop strategies to sharply reduce delivery him in his ICU we have a separate story about that later

for such a plan for years but Greg bird will send them to climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIt's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurgers and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nMyrtle ... says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulates\nAnd says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker this third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to consumers\nBurgers and says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in

and climate change I think it's a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist in political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but Weber says where the president in the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating or Republicans today to embrace any new tax is difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult\nGreg Myrtle sudden acknowledges the challenges and says the carbon tax has
