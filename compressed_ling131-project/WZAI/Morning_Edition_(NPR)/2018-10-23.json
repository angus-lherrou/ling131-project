Steve Inskeep much at stake this fall's Americans vote for Congress but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they were lectures for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nI get elections districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty what is the problem that you're trying to address\nBut we're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got\nIn the ... election and the redistricting that occurred the year after to draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level\nAnd so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the the people let's\nBe blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat one that is slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their bench\nNot only don't criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think we have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table and twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em

one\nWhat kind of money as your guest\n[noise] we've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing um the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting land so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor the state's secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter so in North Carolina we're supporting an IED or else who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so\nHard for Rebecca ... who won a Wisconsin Supreme courts he\nArgued campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nOh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says uh they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally a ... and I think ensure a a fair process\nOne of the attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech

broad debate about how properly to be forced follows that something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate\nWell

will have great influence and drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress and other legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced the Republicans dominated the process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty\nIs the problem that you're trying to address but we'll try\nDrink and racial gerrymandering oh we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election and the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the the people\nLet's be blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat one that is slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their batch [noise]\nNo I don't think I'll criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand eighty\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table and twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty eight team the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen who will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty Eighteen\nWill be at the table in in

raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting lens so governors

look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says as they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally\nA

try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate well\nI certainly think votes through
