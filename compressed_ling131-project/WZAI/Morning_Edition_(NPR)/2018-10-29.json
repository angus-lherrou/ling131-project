month NPR and\nKaiser Health news took a close look at a medical bill that you sent us and today we're going to hear about an unexpectedly expensive bill for a skin allergy test from ... in San Francisco reporter April Dembosky story [noise]\nWhen Janet Winston goes to the doctor she feels up on gas impacts a sandwich and to the services of laughed and that's what I Need to make the three hundred mile fry\nWinston is an English professor in rural eureka California when she needs to see a specialist you often drives six hours one way to Stanford healthcare just south of San Francisco\nI had this rash that wouldn't go away [noise] she got that rash last winter ever horseback riding and it lasted four months it was itchy\nAnd like read the like poison oak\nShe made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the skin cream she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to lip bomb near ...\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test\nBends or pain color phony um\nThey tested her for a hundred in Nineteen Seventy usually found and beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol they put ... into a tiny plastic capsule then they drew a grid and when since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it\nWinston left and then came back two days later\nAnd they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read I back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they test it she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back I didn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scaffold stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nA statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough\nImagine buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know if it had a four cylinder six cylinder it's orange and does it have the top of the wind blew to stereo system or does it have the more comfortable seats we want to know or paying for it and here we don't have any of that\nWhen students insurer Anthem Blue cross agreed to a negotiated rate of fourteen thousand dollars the company says it tries to strike a balance between affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the math just doesn't add up ... says the customary charge for this test is thirty five dollars and that includes twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patients being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she did that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'll be worth it for a lobby the fitting a five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test out\nOf sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is\nThe bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high prices become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things I can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area\nI mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally\nFor references Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health coverage comes from home instead to senior

differently in Georgia a judge has to approve a name change to change the gender marker on your driver's license you needed doctors letter saying you've had gender reassignment surgery the problem is that there are different kinds of transgender surgeries and some trans people don't get any surgery\nFor George a quality which advocates for the L GB teach community she says the Georgia process

home in Rio de Janeiro the continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he'll take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi so so many things after about when it comes to this\nIs an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can redrawing here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy\nBecause they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil or almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and the union for the restoration of national pride and I think that it helps explain why both now defeated the workers' party candidate financial and Daschle so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insists the survival of dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects to judge\nTo remind him and and people that people really do about the constitution what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's essentially shoe but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent and on corrupt for example his Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in Rio\nHe's rainy on that thing to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he really but\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that this is a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high ...\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a than a quarter of senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nThink everybody is worried about it most of the people are\nThe minority okay so both concern and excitement over

anybody that sent the phrase ongoing him is that what you're proposing huh well I run into summer and here's the thing he answered the bad speech or hate speech however you wanted to find that\nIs more speech and always will be\nWhen this online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light that the man accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats and the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour but says gab follows strict rules including no threats she says he created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nWinter thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone who killed Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Donald Trump\nExpressing have for white people towards Christian towards minorities who made a now support Donald Trump or they allow hate to be viewed a certain group of certain people\nSo where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nThink the line is we're free speech become uh\nVice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says ... is prioritizing free speech above all
