his family dodge taxes [noise]\nTwo years ago reporters Suzanne Craig a Canadian was mailed Mr Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax returns\nShe told us he had possibly avoided paying federal taxes for Eighteen years but now the times is reporting that Mr Trump participated in outright fraud we reached Suzanne Craig in New York City\nSuzanne you put out a tweet ... ... what do you have to last night as you waited for this story to be printed in today's paper what did you do\nAfter a after we were finished at work I went out to a depressed New York times press plant in Queens and I watch the uh the story that we wrote roll off the process\nSo we last time we spoke a couple of years ago you received a bomb paper ... in which you had a part of Donald Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax return and from that you were able to extrapolate a lot of information but since then\nYou have found other streams of documents just describe what you've not been in the past two years what you have an earth since then\nSure we continue to look at 'em Donald Trump's taxes off of the story that we wrote in two thousand and sixteen where we got three pages of his tax returns right before election day\nUm and we've just continue to push on his finances part of that we've examined tens of thousands of public documents and we also got access to thousands and thousands of confidential documents Fred Trump's real estate empire\nYou tend to questions to Donald Trump his lawyer Charles Harder responded that should that time stage or implied that President Trump participated in fried or tax evasion or any of the crime it will expose you to buy ability and damages for defamation so I Know the language is careful here and is in the article how would you characterize\nThe charges you're putting out here concerning Donald Trump is family and the families empire well we found in terms\nFound several instances based on the documents that we looked out where a Donald Trump participated in fraudulent talk ski\nIt's getting into some examples and they you know you just say for instance can we talk about what happened when ah they do it was huge numbers of loans that Donald Trump received from his father had grown to into the millions of dollars how did he covered for those\nDonald Trump to sort of long claimed as part of of this this\nNarrative that he's credit for himself that he's sort of but pretty much up from golfing businessmen who made it to the president he's like a self made billionaire and and we found not only did\nWe we uncovered in the documents not only at least sixty one million dollars in loans that uh that Trump extend it to Donald Trump and the case as many of them were repaid we also found that Donald Trump received over ... lifetime more than ... and beyond also has an inheritance more than four hundred million dollars from his father\nTemping is his father and there's one instance you give that he said Trump at one point and spent fifty million dollars to buy a steak in a ... palace how how did he then and then sold it back to his son can you describe that\nSure I think spent Fifteen million would be a generous description of it he Donald Trump owed um\nHis father Fifteen million dollars in that that that um instead of being a you know written off was in fact he used it to invest in the Trump polish so he turned the debt into an investment in Trump polish and then it was written down to almost nothing\nYou mentioned companies the old county building supply maintenance can you tell us what that was\nSure that was one of the most intriguing a fraud that we found it was probably the most kind of ones with the bright lights around it spread Trump who's getting older and she was eighties he he'd only not only you know huge number of buildings and the New York area worth hundreds of millions of dollars\nBut he was also sitting on a huge amount of cash and Donald Trump ... siblings realized that at some point he was going to die and not money was going to be subject to a fifty five percent and heritage talks to what the Trump ... kids that it's it's pretty incredible for years for Trump would\nKnow for his buildings he would buy everything from bridges and so and then one day a company called ... county was created suddenly all county started doing all the buying for fried Trump's empire\nThey would pay three hundred dollars for new fridge is but then they would create a separate receipt and they would mark it up anywhere from twenty to fifty percent and send it up to Fred\nAnd the difference on not was ...\nFor all by Donald Trump and his siblings it ... it allowed them to drain huge amounts millions of dollars in cash from their fathers empire so that it would not be subject to the death talks\nDoes finally the kind of an overarching a theme of this this investigation is that that Donald Trump is presented is understood to have been a self made man isn't but why does it matter what is that in what way does it fit into\nYour a story about pride as to how Donald Trump benefited profited from that mythology\nWell he's he's benefitted greatly over the years from now if this law that has been repeated over and over and over and I guess just the myth making of him that's been wrong and it's a spectacular caught\nIt was interesting as we were going through the reporting early on in the Nineteen seventies right out you know when he graduates he goes to work for his father he doesn't interview you know with the New York times and he goes around and he he talks about this job that's his and and this building that says\nAnd he's driving around in a car and he's you know showing this reporter all this stuff and it was incredible every\nEvery building he showed the reporter was his father's even though he claimed it was his own as his life went on he then started to diminish his father's achievements you know he would say only about a million dollar loan\nMy father was a great building but it was in Brooklyn and queens and then when it came time in two thousand and four or five years after ... Trump staff\nTo sell the empire the biggest single pay day in his life in two thousand and four was done very quietly\nAnd just finally what was that final payday\nThat year was ... just under two hundred million dollars he got roughly a hundred and Seventy seven million\nThe empire itself salt for roughly eight hundred million and and we found through other records that it should have been valued at roughly a billion so you've been on that day the man who wrote the art of the deal you know I think got less than a lot less than you probably should have for that sale\nExtraordinary Suzanne thank you very much is making this okay great thank you\nBye Suzanne Craig's ...
