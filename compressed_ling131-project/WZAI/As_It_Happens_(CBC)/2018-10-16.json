I Know that that's it well I'm hanging on land and Cape Breton that's pretty big because someone that so I'm prince Edward island went that something that people often saying\nOh no no like gets editorial caught off for me I blame the CBC I blame a crutch mark crutches normalized dish or but um oh yeah it's it's a it's a slight the column up in the ER\nAnd he was quite sour about it and I really did owe them on an apology and I get you or hurt ...\nWhy did you decide to issue this apology to the ministers who a letter to the editor\nAll politicians read the letters to the editor and our might send them all Ari I might put something on Facebook now the only way I got a real true apology wrecked by a ... a lottery to they're always read those\n... minutes to ... he reads the

beef or current again and federal minister of agriculture I Would like to formally apologize to you for calling you in last friday at the hall in pools corner have you\nI'm sure all on and on Sunday the small place and it's just a matter of time and you all the running of the people you're ...\n... ... ... ... you think that he did acknowledge the apology did he accept your apology\nOh I've never heard from Lawrence I Would imagine long falls on a problem in the front or almost rather altered\nYeah he did a front man for further on those terrible agriculture deal I've gotten off from Logan related\nI bet you did go on and is that it didn't it didn't stop there you said that ah you said he should tender his resignation and come home to ... and then you said please don't be remembered as the jerk that destroyed the dairy industry so now you tell them you're going to be a jerk if he doesn't resign\nWell all all of them I don't want to be remembered as a joke I didn't actually followed a joke\nBut so if he doesn't do what you say you should do which is ... resigned and come home that he is a jerk\nOutlaw what's all the eighth or like\nThis one other thing about uh your relationship with as it happens you you uh\nDo just write letters to the editor you sent a selfie with your cows we we got that just a last month and a you're adding to our fiftieth anniversary of being on the air we asked people to send us where they listen to the show and you wrote on your\nTweet never miss as it happens it's been on in the milking parlor all my life meet my boy Oliver and twenty cows all becoming informed\nWere given I understand that joined to contains maybe three hundred five hundred milligrams of dried cannabis so considerably less than what they would have why not do the real does why not give them what they might have had they been at a party or or just do does having joined on their own\nWhat we wanted to do is use a ... and a system of ah\nUsing vaporize or is that would be safe and that we could control well in terms of the bills that we were giving to our participant because in in a joint you can have different doses so we wanted to control that part of the study as much as possible\nAnd I know the CIA funded study and they did some polling where they found that one in five young Canadians believed that they\nAre as good or even better when they drive when they're under the influence uh what do you make of that\n[noise] it's interesting because in in our study what we did ask them at different times ... also how they felt about their driving safety and the majority of our participants um didn't feel that they would be safe drivers and even after five hours\nThe they have some self awareness ability and that's interesting when we're thinking about maybe going through with uh some self awareness campaigns\nNo the other war no but also they were they're aware that there is a test and says are probably being more reflective ... on their life state\nYeah it might be the case you're right uh that they may be more reflective because they're in a study about driving and and and the use of Kennedy's\nSo again I'm thinking forward in terms of public awareness campaigns and if we can if they can be targeted to sensitized uh the public and the young drivers I think that's an interesting way one interesting way to go\nGiven your research given what you found out what what would what would you advise and the way of trying to teach young people about marijuana and driving\nI think that the ... messages that if you are under the influence of candidates if you smoke or inhale you shouldn't be driving and you should wait a long enough period of time\nBefore a dry resuming you're driving in our case even after five hours a their capacity were still impaired so\nUh you need to uh wait the significant amount of time before taking the wheel again\nYou were looking at Eighteen to twenty four year old and then you know you were interested in knowing how senior citizens who might be interested in marijuana for medicinal reasons as well as recreational I mean that are you looking to do some more studies like this\nI there are many needed but there are other groups that we didn't look at in our study so as you were mentioning a older I'm drivers who are using a candidates for medicinal reason\nA daily users of Kennedy's um these are all different groups and I don't know that we can extrapolate our result to these other groups where the impact or the influence of Kennedy's Manhattan different defect\nAlright well very very interesting information during this historical week so we are in the midst of the rest of the other no thank you it's a it was a pleasure thank you\n[noise] that was professor Isabel ... from the school of physical and occupational therapy at McGill University we reached her in Montreal\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\nDominic let alone is struggling to sell something that once seemed like a no brainer Mr that long is Justin Trudeau is minister of inter governmental affairs he took on the job this summer as what was once widespread support for liberals carbon pricing plan\nBegan to implode and the Trudeau government has put the plan at the center of its commitment to combating climate change but Ontario Manitoba ... and the odds are all now oppose we reached inter governmental affairs minister Dominique live now in Ottawa\nMinister that you had a broad provincial support for your carbon pricing plan was ambitious than they were on side now you have ... wouldn't be premieres lining up to fight to even to take you to court what went wrong\n[noise] but so Carol from our perspective um we have been consistent with Canadians uh and with our international and global partners to Canada must take urgent action to face the real challenges of climate change we campaigned on that and twenty Fifteen\nAs you noted are referred to in twenty sixteen the provinces a ball signed a framework agreement which spoke about a number of measures\nAnd some provincial elections have created circumstances where different governments are now saying that they want to take a different approach we've also said publicly that our provincial election doesn't actually constitute or climate change plan\nAnd we have told Canadians are and we've told internationally international community that Canada was going to take robust as serious action so we're\nContinuing towards the commitment we made around for example putting a price on pollution making polluters pay\nTo go back to what you just said because you said that they're they're taking a different tack you have ... years as a preview of Ontario or they want to be premier of Alberta who quite possibly will be the premier who are not just opposing you taking a different tack they are campaigning\nThey are putting out rallies come and fight the carbon tax they're raising funds for their campaigns on the back and saying we're going to tear up this carbon tax idea so it's not just a little bit of pushback you have a full scale wind coming toward you\nSo again if some conservative leaders are conservative ... want to run campaigns on particular issues they can explain to their citizens and be accountable for those campaign decisions I don't\nOr purport to understand or or speak for the campaign strategy of different conservative leaders across the country but if conservative leaders and in this case Andrew sheer federally does not have any semblance or any coherent\nPlans to meet the challenges of climate change\nWe're telling Canadians we do and and\nProvincial premier skin organized rallies if they want and say what they want it those partisan rallies what we're focused on a is bringing forward a very clear and robust plan to tackle the serious challenge of climate change which Canadians see in their daily lives is very real\nWe saw heroin New Brunswick with a historic floods last spring the wildfires in British Columbia the tornados that hit auto up\nAnd get you know a few weeks ago so Canadians notice Israel and they expect their government to take\nCoherent and concerted action\nThan we have said that we will we are prepared to do that and then when the case of provinces decide not to be partners we have a federal plan including a price on pollution\nWhich will come into effect on January first and we will then be in a position to give that money back to Canadians in those jurisdictions where we applied a federal plan because provincial leaders have decided not to take their obligation seriously\nI guess I'm asking is that if some of these ... are actually campaigning on fighting the carbon tax or calling it the job killing taxes\nYou know and they're being successful doing that isn't entirely their fault that people are buying into it that or is it the fact that possibly you're a liberal government the federal government has failed to make it clear to Canadians why you think it's necessary\nSo again that the job killing taxes that was a phrase Mr Harper used to use all the time in the house of commons I remember that when we were sitting in the corner\nIn third place he used to accuse the liberals are having all these job killing tax secret plans and Canadians took us from from third place to first place with a majority government and implementing a price on pollution\nAnd that deals with the real challenge of climate change is that commitment we made the Canadians and it's something that our government\nIs very serious about uh about putting in place and as I say I think we need to be careful if there were Thirteen premier of provinces and territories across the country\nJust because one or two or three ... find a megaphone and go to a rally we shouldn't cross infect other jurisdictions that are working constructively and positively with us on a on these issues\nBut it's not just a few news is that you've got for clean is against you you've got Ontario there's got to on prince Edward island plus now Manitoba I buy in Palestine just a month ago just into that was celebrating him as the conservatives who gets it", "year": "2018",
