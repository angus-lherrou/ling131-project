division and yesterday he and his colleagues presented some video at a conference in Hobart, Tasmania\nThey had captured the video using cameras that they've sunk to the bottom of the southern ocean and what they found there was something so peculiar but even the marine scientists did not know what to name it turns out it is called the headless chicken monster\nWe reached ... wells for in Hobart\nMr Welsh for that had chicken monster sounds terrifying what does it actually looks like\nIt's actually caught a graceful and you see cucumber that lives in the city and it can swim unlike some other sea cucumbers it kind of looks like a pink balloons with wings\nAnd how did you figure out what it was\nSo we were caught suppose we'd sit the camera on the sea floor in the southern ocean using one of the stream fishing vessels that goes down ... again ... when we ... we really had no idea what it was the first case where the jellyfish that um we did a little bit more research that's when we would yeah\nBut it's similar when he's a ... fan in the Gulf of Mexico and so on that basis we uh where I was looking for them but it was a lift ticket ...\nNow the monster ... is a is a lovely shade purple and it's almost by last I guess it glides along the ocean floor how can something so I'm assuming Lee beautiful end up with a name like the headless chicken monster\nUm well we didn't come up with the nine and our colleagues at the national oceans and atmosphere administer Ayesha other ones of course it they'd bring them the civil you know when my parents are both will stay in Mexico\nIt kind of looks a little bit like a chicken before you put it in the oven it's going to get that shot but some of the only ... that's got wings so I think that's why I like her so that that way\nAnd it has these these really delicate almost frilly tentacles that didn't that supported as it dances across lips are on the floor and what is it actually doing as it as it moves along the ocean floor yeah sorry\nSo it ... off the sequel\nThat's unusual for so you could come as a you know the most typical sea cucumber\nOr that you come across in your ... like a sausage the laws on the floor but the Hitler speaking most couldn't swim and its wings from pets the types of food and then when it rains almost equal it has the tentacles in a ring around at Stanford eases Greece to sit through the Senate and pick up articles of food\nAnd you didn't expect to find it in that part of the world\nThat are on most of the records that we know all of the ... secretly town from the tropics fill the sub tropics whereas this one was found in the southern ocean nearly three thousand kilometers southwest of the strategy in New and all of the cold hurt at all and so we were caught surprised to find a vet thought sale\nAny theories on why it's there\nIt's possible the winds but um that area of the ice is is applies we haven't done a lot of research\nReally only guess about a descriptive as soon as the same terms with the ... so they might be multiple he goes to get most of them that we really got a but there's almost certainly lots of other organisms that we've never seen before that will discover as weight to pull him all cameras\nCan you tell me about um some of the other ... creatures that you've found down their\nSon and one of them do some big stony spotted crabs looked down made well we got some cookies at one of those ... in front of the camera\nOr do they denied um that they carried out torture which of course I'm as contradicted by though the wealth of evidence that we and and other groups have documented\nA lot of this crackdown on dissent can be traced to the political feud between not hot on the Palestinian authority and Hamas in Gaza can you tell us a bit about the political affiliations that are leading to the human rights abuses\nAbsolutely I mean we're we're living in a situation of course where um you know that the west bank and Gaza Strip and effectively now a divided for over a decade so you have a mass\nAnd control in Gaza and the fact that dominated Palestinian Authority and the west bank both of which have shown\nA little uh provide the little room for supporters of the other to engage and\nExpression organizing et cetera um policies of course simply living under a military occupation now for\nFor over fifty years characterized by systematic writes abused and part of the split between the U.S has been up there have there has not there's no legislative counsel there have not been elections in over a decade so you have a climate in which there is that the conventional political\nUm systems in place and then a context in which there to authorities that have little tolerance for defense\nNow authorities most in the west bank and Gaza have claimed that these abuses are only isolated incidents uh that uh are properly investigated and dealt with how do you respond to that\nA ... you know human rights watch spent two years investigating these abuses in the quake\nCases um we see arbitrary arrests this dissidents across different forms of of of whether it be social media journalists demonstrators students and we see a you know over the course of years our first report on torture I Palestinian authority's dates back to Nineteen Ninety five\nNow the U.S and Europe provide financial aid to the Palestinian authority do you think it's time for those countries to reconsider their commitment given the accusations against the Palestinian authority a torture\n'em there's been significant focus on the international community and developing the rule of law I'm ... and Palestinian society but security assistance is being provided to forces that are doing the very opposite of maintaining the rule of law\nA human rights watch calls on uh the ... us an email with the case of the Palestinian authority to suspend assistance to units involved and widespread arbitrary arrests and torture and kill these abuses stopping perpetrators are held to account\nIn past reports you have repeatedly singled out Israel's for violating the human rights and Palestinians if authorities and the Palestinian territories are also committing human rights abuses where does that leads the Palestinian people\nWithout the people are stuck between authorities that are in tolerant of dissent Palestinians are and they're you know I'm fifty first year of an occupation characterized by institutional discrimination systematic rights abuses and it's at the same time\nThey're being squeezed by authorities Hamas in Gaza and about string theory in the west bank that are tolerant of dissent and are simply systematically stamping out criticism\nSo Palestinians um you know are are are in a unique situation where they're facing um you know a a an ugly occupation ah right with abuse\nAt the same time as authorities but little autonomy exercising a little bit of power they have to not to operate ... police say\nMr ... thanks so much for speaking with me today\nMy pleasure thank you\nWell Marsha ... is the director with human rights watch we reached him in Ramallah and we did reach out to the Palestinian authority for response to the report through their official representative in Canada we did not hear back by air time also we contacted Hamas also we did not receive a response from them by the time

what what's your sense as to how they're treating this\nLike ... like I'm very apologetic like I'm I'm so sorry for what I did and like it was stupid but like I mean I get it and they they better to punish me for it\nLike actually called me that it will just be fine but I don't think it's just going to be a fine\nI was CBC congregants David Greene speaking to Brittany Schneider now burn a woman has been charged after she spray painted a thirteenth century wall in northern Thailand\nPhone call\nFraud extortion and witchcraft those are the charges against a Milton, Ontario psychic she stands accused of ... people that have tens of thousands of dollars which explains a fraud and extortion chargers\nBut she was also charged under section three six five of the criminal code pretending to practice witchcraft\nAnd architect provision that could soon be cleared from the books hoping regional police detective constable Sarah McCullough investigated this so called psychic we reached detective comfortable McCullough in Milton\nDetective constable McCullough what does this psychic accused of doing to her clients\nWell we had a victim come forward that had been um she claimed to have been defrauded to of just over sixty three thousand dollars in cash and property\nAnd what was told that was happening was ah you were going in for your original psychic reading and\nAfter that ... she would tell you that you know she's sensitive that energy around you or she sends to curse and she used that and said that for six hundred seven hundred dollars\nThat you would pay to have her do rituals and cleansing in order to take away the bad spirits\nAs she would gain your trust she wouldn't ask you for you know a couple of thousand dollars so that it can be blessed and be returned to use and in order to gain their trust you would actually give that money back\nAnd then over an extended period of time she would start to ask for larger and larger sums of money which would get into the thirty forty thousand dollar range wants to victim would start to ask for the money back [laughter]\nHe would say that bad things would happen to bad things that happened to her family and then eventually just stop returning phone calls\nNow obviously the clients who who went to her ... leaves and these sorts of powers but are there any other characteristics of the ... the people have who were willing to hand over so much money to essentially a stranger\nTypically these are very vulnerable people there in a very vulnerable state in their life they've either gotten a divorce going through a divorce have lost a loved\nThe family or an illness themselves they're searching for answers are searching for anyone that can give them any good news or reasons why this is happening to them\nYou know you had this original accusation and then you moved forward with other people who claimed the same thing was it difficult to get these more people to to come forward with these claims\nI it was it was very difficult at the very beginning we only had a few victims and some people were too embarrassed to come forward and too embarrassed to move forward with charges [laughter]\nSo that's why we had one great victim that we're able to glean a lot of information from and were able to charge the psychic with extortion fraud over and the witchcraft fortune telling
