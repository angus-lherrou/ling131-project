he is ending solitary confinement in federal prisons\nRoger Goodell is making that moved in response to a series of high profile cases including the death of Ashley Smith and then there's the bc judge who ruled earlier this year that keeping prisoners locked up alone for twenty two hours or more a day is a violation of their constitutional rights\nUnder the legislation introduced today inmates will be presented with what is being called the opportunity to leave their cells for four hours each day reporters asked\nWhether that is just a solitary confinement by another name here's what minister Goodell had to say\nIt is not a it is a fundamentally different approach or do you go to the to the definition\nOf what the United Nations would call administrative segregation or solitary confinement it's a those two hours that are the key threshold when you're able to provide more than that as we're going to be doing under this new system with the proper kinds of interventions this will lead to the accomplishment of two objectives\nKeeping the institutions and the people in those institutions including the staff\nSafe and secure but at the same time being able to continue the programming that will have the impact of contributing to the long term rehabilitation of prisoners so the key question\nWhat happened to that theory\nI don't know we don't know what happened to it every a leading a paper and journals opinion had been given the same tip off that that the Saudis were on the edge of doing that right before among my ...\nAnd we don't know whether Donald Trump told them not to do that which she may have said you know he believes that you ever admit anything that than the cards in the fall so denied it and I and I we don't know if this was a Trump led a issue or whether\nMore likely explanation feels under so much pressure among his royal cousins within the royal court that if he is attached to this low cooperation or not rogue operation his days are numbered in that role\nOkay the other element as you mentioned is the Turkish officials in what they're putting out so you got the possibility that at a downtown and the crown prince and the king or trying to work out what the story's going debate but meanwhile the Turkish officials\nAnd not just the giving these other bits of information but actually coming up with photos in evidence that they you mentioned the Sistine Saudi operatives who flew into ... on the day that Janelle ... disappeared uh and and one of the ... an autopsy expert with the bones are\nSo what does that do to either the rogue agent or as a theory or the botched interrogation theory\nIt makes it all a charade it it it makes it makes what we've seen\nYou know everyone who looks at this has an understanding of what likely occurred it doesn't matter if you're a Senator Lindsey Graham Senator Bob Corker Senator Marco Rubio all Republicans all think democracy Yogi was murdered well yet again the one single person not coming to that conclusion as the president the United states Donald Trump\nHas it come to the point where it doesn't matter ... we we know they're lying there saying these things we know it's not too and it doesn't matter that line doesn't matter we're just going to at some point to that that now accepted this is what is going to give you the truth even though everyone knows it's not and\nAnd Donald Trump and the the the crown prince and the king just hope the world loses interest\nI think that as a gamble that they may be taking it would be a mistake on their part um I think it's very hard\nTo imagine that Mohammed bin ... will ever get an interview with any other global mainstream journalist and this not be\nThe anchor of that interview where they start you know our own my own magazine the Atlantic Jeff Goldberg writer and chief that have very wide ranging interview with mom and builds up and saw him on when he visited the United states in Washington a recently I Can't imagine him ever having that opportunity again without being directly ah\nChallenged about um ah what Saudis are allegedly did a against democracy choking and having this part of it and that's that's the future that that they're going to have if you think that they can you know try to exhaust the world with this and turn away and act as if nothing had happened\nJust finally because democracy because he was\n... said that he suspected he lives in this kind of danger\nDemocracy okay I've known him for a very long time\nI Can't speak for him now of course any more I don't think he ever conveyed that he thought it was life was in danger story that we don't know we don't see is that there is grief inside Saudi Arabia there is frustration inside the royal court there's anger\nAround Mohammad bin ... on that he put them in this position because they actually liked ended mired in respected ... much of what Jamal was doing even as he was criticizing um their government on occasion but I think Jim all\nNew and
