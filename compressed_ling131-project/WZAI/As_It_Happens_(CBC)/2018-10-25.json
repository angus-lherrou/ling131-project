I don't think so and then it was strictly news for every day meals well ... what a family\nBy is not only the Thanksgiving here\n[noise] now I as a kid I had a lot of frozen green beans and cream of mushroom soup but never to gather um what what does what does the green bean casserole tastes like\nA it's a like green beans next done with that [laughter] so yeah it's\nA and I think if people didn't call it a casserole they just think of it as green names will fight off\nDo you like it was in [noise] in small quantities [laughter]\nSo and there are variations we make the need in very Asia and then you can do it very upscale\nSomeone described the original recipe on Twitter as tasting like what cigarettes would you agree\nNo it's not that bad [laughter] so if if\nPeople don't like there are so mixed together they're not going to like casserole of any I Am a casserole are kinda stereotyped as being something that\nHealth wise and and the west may they became very popular in the Nineteen fifty here when the magazine you know but they're all sorts of stereotypes any jokes about casserole is in general\nRight now the dish only has a handful of ingredients and it involves less cooking and more combining of these ingredients just recipe get to be considered iconic when really it's not much of a recipe\nIt doesn't require any calling Harry training at all which is part of the reason many people dismiss it as not being real cooking but it's also part of the reason that it became so popular it's something that anyone can make and\nYou're guaranteed to have an edible outcome\nUm it might not be as tasty as some people that liked but for people who don't have a lot of money to experiment or they have extensive ingredients or take we're making something very elaborate and then it doesn't work and they have to throw it out we bean casserole always works\nRight it's hard to think that a recipe like this would be a hit today ... with all of these food programs and sort of a commentary obsession why do you think the green bean casserole was such a hit in mid century America\nIf you keep in mind that the Nineteen fifties was following on in the wake of World War two there was a sense of everyone wanted to be\nExotic or things that were too expensive to to Bahrain this was a dish that cut across\nAll socioeconomic levels so if you wanted to make it add things that were very expensive you could you know but the basic ingredients were very inexpensive you know ... so this is a very democratic type of dish\nOn a very conformist which is what people in the Nineteen fifties wanted\nAnd and it became a tradition and and there's one that is still popular today a particularly around Thanksgiving isn't mainly ... do you think\nI Would say in in some places it is not all of it because\nBecause it's something that you know the mothers and grandmothers from the Nineteen fifties were making and then it just became part of the family tradition um I think it in in the mid west that it represents the industrialization industrialized agriculture that characterizes the region\nOn a lot of the food processing factories are in this area you know so that when people say eat local you know then the the Campbell's Soup factory that's ... ... is one that's about thirty five minutes away from me\nThat local [laughter] last night and using what wouldn't even know if it is part of the local scenery and it's part of people's occupation is part of the landscape\nAnd she was never on the a graveyard or or you know\nShe was she didn't she needs a baby with sake but she wasn't allowed to be with the baby and she wasn't allowed to see the baby after she died she didn't know why the baby was buried she was literally thrown ice on the road herself\nHow'd edition packed her life\nShe was a very damaged taught chip so she was a very unhappy woman she she was Haji cheaper if you know she gave birth to six more children\nShe had lots and lots of heartbreak and a difficult how life but it was only in life to life and more and more of the story came out that you wouldn't distilled why she was the person that she was\nThe home was run by the sisters of ... which is a complex organization and your mother lived to Ninety two\nHe died just two years ago did she ever get an apology for what happened to her\nWhen when when the story came out the thing that the bombs that caused it was to hire a very expensive PR person called Terry pros\nAnd in response to a French documentary filmmaker who I could possibly the story be true of seven hundred Ninety six babies left and if that sick time having problems response was to knock the women and children\nWith that ... that the email is ... is in the public didn't pay it talks about that no bones found in the west of Ireland there were no mass grave yeah in the west of Ireland it's just a load of old farming bones no there was no apology\nNow they've agreed to contribute to and a half million euro uh some three and a half million Canadian dollars for the costs of the ... excavation how do you feel about that\nThat that the bumps the cooler though the ... of one of the wealthiest all ages they ah one of the biggest health care providers in Ireland\nOn the government estimates that the cost of the excavation will be between five million ... million on the bones of course I think it's okay to pay\nLess than a call so\nNo I don't think not good enough they um the state were responsible for what happened to to stay in the states should pay equally\nNow the remains are supposedly going to be given quote a respectful burial do you think your sister is a is among the bones of the babies there\nWe're very cynical because in in twenty twelve there was a report by the Hague to face that\nBetween two mother and baby home on ... a ... and babies with traffic\nTo America a thousand babies so one of the reasons we we've talked about it from day one that they needed to excavate they needed to identify 'em we need finally to be told\nYes there were seven hundred and Ninety six babies in those ... those an every babies being identified because I Believe that my sister is the second the five year old woman living her life so ... maybe ... maybe America\nWho have no idea of a history of West she literally comes from\n[noise] if you do find her remains in the graveyard what would you like to see happen\n[laughter] but when my mother died two years ago we never put a new headstone on the grave because I don't want a headstone to go on that gray until about

sexual misconduct allegations against you you're assuming see t._v. for defamation for reporting those um you've denied this do you think that the two women who made those accusations are lying\n[noise] so I wouldn't wish\nFalse allegations are on anyone I Would have wished on my on my a worst enemy and so um [noise] those I'm I'm sure there was a a political angle to this stuff how people were convinced a worker Joel to makeup false stories but I think it became very clear in the weeks out\nUm that ah that\nThat they were fictitious are stories have the allegation by women been withdrawn\nI sold a ... well not a I and I I don't want to go in the past but but obviously the people that made the false allegations disappeared in some cases sent sent over the country and so but having\nSaid that I I I don't want to get into those details day was obviously I'm a political um uh attack job and I'm going to have\nTo defend that ended that is before the courts are so I'd be careful not to get ... get too much into those details but there's a reason there's eight million dollar defamation lawsuit for what was very sloppy journalism the factors for his style apart so
