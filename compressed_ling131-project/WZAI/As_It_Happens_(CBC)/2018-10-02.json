I paid ... disputes mechanism is a chapter Nineteen that was very important to Canada and in exchange they seem to have given up three point six percent to the Canadian dairy market to us farmers\nThat doesn't seem like it I guess it's an awful train to lead the Canadians I don't think\nWell I I find it interesting you say that because um the the NAFTA deal is already in place that chapter Nineteen was already in place\nSo if chapter Nineteen or this or NAFTA panel such an efficient with such a great uh a thing to have a why wasn't doing anything about the aluminum and steel tariffs why wasn't going to be able to protect us from terrorists than our automobile\nUh if if that's not the panel was half it's worth in a forgiving up the dairy industry\nOr we shouldn't have been concerned about those terrorists in the first place\nWhat would you have done we do have walked away would you said no deal\nWell it's very complicated obviously a they were getting ready to a hit us with more tariffs\nSo that that was not a good situation for candidates to be falling and but um I I didn't find this was like any other trade negotiation at least with ah the Europeans and the Trans Pacific deal ah everyone was there I think negotiating fairly\nThis one was more like a star and\nThis one was they hijacked sectors of our economy they threatened to do irreparable damage to our economy and if we didn't give them what they wanted a they would proceed with these terrorists um I I found it was very aggressive that wasn't that go sheeting\nOr this wasn't a negotiation this was a negotiating our way out of a hostage situation\nSo again would you walked away then would you have said no deal I'm not going to be held hostage\nSome somebody has to do this a waitress\nThe way he's he's ruined I I find so many uh of parts of a society [noise] ah I thought Canada was going to be the country\nTo to stand up to them and said you know this isn't right we have rules in place NAFTA already had a certain rules that you shouldn't have been able to to put tariffs on aluminum and steel and they told me to address those issues we shouldn't have been going any further\nBut we heard today found prime minister to do and some foreign affairs minister freelance\nWest that and they basically said that well that the upside for the dairy farms and dairy farmers is that the supply management system is fundamentals in it at least is still in place and that the dairy farmers are going to be compensated for losses they sat for his part of this trade deals so against Canadian point of view\nIt's hard to see how we've lost what would you say back if you could be at that press conference and respond what would you say\nHow did we get to that point that we were no longer looking for a better deal we're just looking to salvage something out of it so that we didn't get completely destroyed that I don't understand why we allow ourselves\nTo be on her knees as bad as we want we were in a bad position and uh they negotiated to salvage something but uh we weren't smart enough to get ourselves into a better position for them so lucky\nAnd now if it does go to as we see it how does that change your life how does that change your work your business\nOr ... you mentioned the compensation package Jeff uh they've had numerous compensation packages or credit for for other trade deals that I've received your dollars to date usually instead of giving a money over to a farmer's district or at the best way to distribute it\nThey come up with some bizarre way of uh investing it in our farms and or if you don't fit or the exact the type that they want for the investments then you're not eligible on the money is always in his shoes so to date I received a hundred dollars\nBut are you going to survive and you're going is your business going to to be okay\nIt's better than help I mean it it of course you know you ... your carry on I'm a I'm Still relatively young I have a son was wanting to come home and farm\nSo uh we'll have to making investments and are trying to be more efficient fight back the market share that we've lost a lot of money a reinvest that money and and and try and get my cash flow back up\nSurvival of the radio what you're going a trading off three plus percent uh every year we only know how much of our market share a no is it you need to go on forever doing that\nAnd the problem is is next time we go to negotiate no one's ever happy with what they have they'll want or so if we're already over ten percent but we are giving up of a market\nThe Americans only allowed to ... percent of the trade war over ten percent now\nSo who's who's the protection of food who's not a free trader and I will not says\nOkay look so good points there Mr is going to appreciate speaking with you thank you well thank you for calling\nJason ... is a dairy farmer we reach them an inch in brook Quebec and we will have more on the U.S MCA later on in the\nProgram including various tongue twisting attempts to pronounce the name of the new agreement and an interview with former conservative cabinet minister bitter McCain\n[noise]\n\nFirst there was an earthquake and then came the water a deadly six meter sooner army\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBut as a clip from a video that has been circulating on social media a man on a balcony warning people below the water is coming\nToday survivor's on the Indonesian island of ... are dealing with the destruction of friday's left behind as we go to air the official death toll is over eight hundred that number is likely to rise to over one thousand officials have been\nBurying the dead in mass graves Rebecca ... is the BBC's Indonesia editor we reached her in Palo which was hit by the tsunami\nRebecca can you describe but you're able to see in town right now\nAt the moment I'm standing on one of them in Haiti in to the worst affected area and you might hear in the background the sound that have the uh trucks coming in they hiring excavated into the area\nThe has been much needed in the recent day that people ...\nWho the rebel within their hands it hasn't in this heavy duty quick meant to try and rescue supply and also to find ... in the rubble\nBy that powerful quake on friday and then also washed away by this now made that was triggered by it\nDo they still believe that they can recover people alive or is this the recovery operation at this point\nThere has been some rescue attempt in the last forty eight hours that has been successful in one place to take care of in a horror\nTales eight or a hotel that collapsed the hotel owner was saying yes today that he was still hearing people yelling out for help and Denise rebel but he was able to reach them they did manage to rescue more than twenty four people though using their hands\nFrom that hotel but as the days continue the hopes of finding people alive\nI Would have to say a now ...\nYou have been able to get to the hospitals to see what is happening there who's being cared for and how they're being cared for what does that tell us what's going on there\nWho have been to some of the small medical clinics\nAround ... situation a very bleak and there's no power to the entire town so us through any coup clinic set time too complicated operations are they running out of medical supplies\nAs you could who were either in the house or witness the events or those who spoke to the people who were at the house are with us the events remember what the FBI is trying to do right now\nIs not prepare a case for trial they're just trying to provide as much as good a information as they possibly can\nAnd show the circle widens the more you talk to people the more leads you get that so you talk to additional people and that process continues really until you run out of people to talk to\nSomebody could they get out of it say talking to mark judge who was the the friend Kevin ... who was\nAllegedly in the room when this like assault took place they he has already put out a statement saying that he doesn't remember this a ... totally against the character he knows that ... to have\nA he doesn't bring it happen what more could do with what could the FBI find out from ... that didn't come out in that statement\nWon't Mark Church is a good example of Carol statement that he put out was put out through his lawyer it wasn't sort of tested he wasn't pushed on it he wasn't prodded to remember other details he wasn't asked perhaps for the names of people who might have been there if he continues to claim that he mark judge was not\nAnd so that's why I'm agents wants to talk directly to witnesses I'm not saying that all that but we're\nOr a misleading statement but might have been a cursory statement and it needs to be tested\nSome of the things that had been set including by your former boss James Comey is that the the leads that were presented on Thursday to an investigation would be evidence that a judge Kavanaugh\nMay have lied during his testimony that he may have not been\nFully open about his drinking habits and about his problems in that area of alcohol what would investigators wanted to know about that would that be something that you need to know more about as to what we're judge Kavanaugh's drinking habits while he was in in high school and in university\nNot necessarily except that it's\nImportant that anybody up for confirmation for Supreme Court seat before the Senate Judiciary committee be completely truthful\nSo oddly the underlying conduct whether he drank drank to access in high school might not be all that relevant but whether he was honest with the Senate Judiciary committee about his drinking habits I think is relevant\nAnd then there are also the references to the year book that was presented that remarks that were sent about ... Kevin ... at the time\nAnd that he said we're references to drinking when in fact I just said no they were\nReferences to sexual activity and some of it quite quite awful about what they might have done I wanted to do to some women so whether he did or didn't do any of those things that what matters in that that he may have misrepresented what that book was saying\nWell to be clear some of the underlying conduct if he assaulted women is absolutely disqualify a no ifs ands or buts about that\nOn the other hand if it had to do only with drinking I use that term only cautiously it's still very important that he'd be honest about it before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIf however the underlying conduct is um\nThe way he treated women whether he sexually assaulted or abused them in some way or that matters a lot and that's why you want a full FBI investigation to the extent we had to find out we need to find out\nAll right we'll be watching Mr Rosenberg I appreciate speaking with you thank you\nCarol thank you for having me on the show and thank you for giving me a chance to talk about the FBI\nI take care Bye bye bye Chuck Rosenberg is a former ...\nOffice in Washington DC [noise]\nGive me you know\nAs you say hey what chip guy ...\nIs a God Knows I ...\nYou got us MCA [noise] how'd you have heard by now that is the new name for the renegotiated version of NAFTA and does that abbreviations awkwardness has many people annoyed or in the case of Financial Times writer Alan Beatty\nNearly serious as their media exploded on Twitter trying to stop people from referring to the U. S. M. C. A. as an acronym because he says it cannot be pronounced as a word\nWe reached howling B.D in Brussels\nAllen us NCAA doesn't really rolled off the tongue doesn't\nIt doesn't and it's you know somebody's receive care about language as well as trade deals are kind of disappointing 'cause ... there was such a lovely think the single word [noise] you know you could have dumped into slogans like ... we don't have to that kind of thing and not just for been replaced by yet another abbreviation that you can't really say well\nOkay but you've taken the ones that you don't you're not just kind of disappointed you're mad because why because people are using it\nI'm ... how people using it I'm also not because people say and then when they mean abbreviations and you know an acronym is the thing you can say masters an acronym us MCA isn't it ... and I just I don't think we should be the issue was the name of acronyms cause they happen to visit\nBut this is it you say this is a hill that you're willing to die on\nActually yes ups and why [laughter] well\nI tell you why I've covered shade for more than ten years okay when I started a as a journalist when I started covering said I realize this is the subject so complicated that the ... started running into full that is the full that basically all the stuff I covered it run into freelancers merits on for that [noise] and so keeping in your head\nThese enormous if evaluations when you came across one that you could actually said that was actually a ... acronym you really want to sort of hold onto it um it's sort of the fact that this has gone and disappeared and ...\nParents it that I just find it very ... I think\nNow of course people are arguing that in fact you you can turn it into an acronym you could say was ... or ... or something of that nature right I mean it's not all is not lost on\nThe realities of our shortage that's the problem there was a ... to ... miles I'm\nJust saying why there's three vowels in this there's like well I guess since it was not going to ... you going to\nPut that in the inconvenient and tries to either end you see what you really need is some kind of out in the middle east you all people invented they are the ... the or in a in the middle so certainly as you just said it was ... as a loose some car or something like this one other thing I've noticed is unbelievably deceitful and these people just switched to Constance around\nUm and so people are kind of got what we should say it was more like you could say however that just Denver's tribute he won't because the constant during the wrong or\nOkay here's some way to get the next a next is a vowing here since there's us there's two letters Canada C. H. two letters and actually the only has one letter said he put and actually put the neck in the mess\nIn the snake you'd have ... ... I mean that would be three vowels three countries everyone gets their fair share do six letters and everyone has their two others\nThat will be up to be great\nIf that flooded named it I Would invite you to address you can face to the White House Washington DC but you know they didn't do that and why they call them why they didn't do that and understand that\nYou could also switches around right some suggesting that we could call it the ah the Canada Mexico us agreement and say see a and you asked would you be can be and he didn't invent\nBuys you that I think it would be perfect that would be absolutely perfect and it was more or less you know the parts of the existential despite a um the nothing this crisis existential to spend the whole tractors just limited Donald Trump\nYou have ... you can actually put ... into this existential angst and candy both the same thing right\nUp to you I mean I remember the and I think he's done a great novels was and mother died today was it yesterday I called in and she just she can cheat and cat\nUm and you could I think that you could just say exactly the same you know ... what was it yesterday I Can't remember [laughter] I'm ...\nI I Would have gone for is is that had been ... they come up with I Would have bunker if it's if it's such a nasty I live\nBut what's what's missing obviously besides the ex about is the word ... free trade and trade isn't even in the world trade isn't in here free trade and open trade managed a no reference to trade\nAnd so that it doesn't it's we don't even know what kind of agreement this is this non acronym\nPile of laughter doesn't tell us anything does it\nShe is not really we're talking about that but some\nIdea of shade and treat shading says it's not so discredited you have to look even this trade new dance even say which is about um shows you know you have an agreement you can't even say politically and it doesn't say it to that just long enough to get", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "02"}
