assault\nBy judge Brett Kavanaugh\nOn surprisingly perhaps the two parties interpreted the findings very differently here is what Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell had to say earlier today\nSo what are what are the facts and evidence tell us after seven appeals to investigate to trick\nThe fact is that these allegations have not been collaborated allegations have been corroborated by the seventh beyond us to go after\nSaddam and new FBI investigation not anywhere so none of these last night of allegations have been corroborated as confirm Bobby seventh and layers FBI

McConnell speaking earlier today Senate Democrats had a very different take here as Senate Democratic\nAnd so he went in there and he didn't come out\n[noise] correct yeah they just went in and did not come out we have not heard from him since\nWhat concerns did he have about going there because he is not exactly well loved by the ... as Saudi Arabia by the government and so what was he worried at all that he expects to you or to anyone that he had concerns about this visit\nYeah I Do know that his fiance didn't and they said that he was worried about going to the conflict that he had received assurances from his diplomatic friends that he would be fine I'm going\nAnd his fiance was waiting for him outside is that right\nCorrect way to from outside um he had given her several numbers to call it\nWas a little nervous about going to the conflict in the first place and then uh he did not come out\nWhen did she do how long did you stay there\nSo she said it for several hours after the conflict had close even um and even the next day ... went back\nAnd went back with a number of other journalists to a demand has release my understanding is that um she is a not well over the situation\nBut again there are there have been reports of of journalists that have been gathering particularly the Turkish Arab journalists coalition that is gathering to um to pressure and and demand answers basically\nIs there any chance that he could have left and she didn't know about it\nUm I I'm sure that is what is that when what's on all of our minds right now obviously I'm the Saudi authorities are maintaining that he left the conflicts and uh the latest statement and the thing that they're cooperating with Turkish authorities\nTo try to find him on the Turkish official position from the presidential spokesperson is that\nThey have reason to believe that he is still there\nAs with all constantly since the local authorities who provides a police forces around the country this month the the host country Turkish police who are on the security at the consulate they say they check the security cameras and did not see Mr ...\nLeave the building on foot but they do say that a number of diplomatic cars had been moving in and out of the conflict since Tuesday so is that where your concerns lie\nI'm sure I think there's that and then there are just the concerns that frankly that we're hearing very very different and reflecting theories and explanations from the Saudis and the Turkish authorities\nThem from our efforts at the at the post you know we really receptive both um Saturday in Turkish authorities so we hope that uh the Turks can\nPressure there Saturday counterparts for information for answers I'm I'm sure in an ideal situation a there are CCD CCTV cameras and then you know show is that the tapes if if the Saudis are saying it is true that a ... I'm actually to leave then there should be evidence of that\nWhy would Saudi Arabia take him I Would maybe change 'em all 'cause she'll be\nSomeone who has worked with them and in fact I just saw him a few weeks ago here in Washington where he's been living for about ...\nYeah it's been critical of of the Saudi Government and in particular the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nObviously this is all happening against the backdrop of a wave of crackdowns a defense in Saudi Arabia\nA just a few days ago some of them out of the economist was I'm charged with a terrorism after being detained for nearly a year as well um women activists plenty of other journalists and clerics\nI'm so this is a ... and mystery surrounding demolish happening against this this backdrop and um you know we were publishing wars has pieces in Arabic and I I Do know that that ah\nIt's something that the Saudi authorities are sensitive to them but again I think what Jamal always told me that she did not want to be labeled as a dissident or as a\nPhysician journalists he really just wanted to write it off in a lot of his his work was even advising Mohammed bin Salman about here's what I think you should do we forget that that Jamal was a it was formally over a royal family advisor at one point\nUm so uh it is it is really quite stunning I'm quite studying to see what's been happening in the kingdom in general just sitting there and tolerance for dissent and could make Jamal the target absolutely\nAs you point out he was formerly he was an advisor to the royal family so what what ... what changed and why why was he didn't he turned against this particular regime\nSo and it has the very first piece that I I commissioned and edited for him last September um the title was that Saudi Arabia and you know was always repressive now it's becoming unbearable\nUm he basically just saw a lot of his friends getting swept up in the crackdown seesaw friends uh being imprisoned or having travel bans a slapped on them and uh the time you know he he wrote hound Saudi Arabia we deserve better than this\nAnd this is again a kingdom that is showing even under this new conference total and tolerance for any sort of dissent or or criticism of their policy\nWe know what it is Mohammed bin Salman has consolidated his power he has as you pointed and arrested\nHundreds of Clara exact with his business people numbers of them were detained outside the country what became of them is there any record of people getting released as there is a pattern that you might be able to give you hope that you know she'll be my my ... ...\n[noise] um that's that's the difficult part\nAgain we know we'd have activists and journalists and social media stars that\nHave been held for months a year even before being a before being charged with anything so yes I'm very worried but I get to stay hopeful that keeping a spotlight on his name and on this case both scare us and abroad can can help for speedier

the world arm wrestling championships we reached I'm a kill in beach Berg Ontario\nI'm or did you inherit your talent for arm wrestling I did for sure who did you get it from\nI got it from well both my parents and my grandma\nAnd they were good at arm wrestling they were amazing [laughter] did you wrestle them\nNot my grandma ... my dad and my mom definitely and did they usually win well yeah it's more of a respect thing for me when did you start when did you start to smoke them well I said just\nThe age of Eighteen and my dad well I use rarely hurt him\n[laughter] so good to practice with your dad\nExactly and what about my grandmother viewers\nOh she's still Berkeley and that her age how old is you know she's\nJust and their seventies a him to be honest I I'd rather live better age\n[laughter] I'm On you're you're not wrestling or because you're afraid to\nYes [laughter]\nSo you okay so obviously comes in with your new inherited but when did you first get interested in competition an arm wrestling\nAbout Fifteen Years old actually\n[laughter] about come about\nOh my God and I and my mom we were invited on this um was Alan ... men for he was doing a fundraiser for himself and he said I Will give off for camera whoever can beat me\nAnd I was like well free camera right so we went in that and my dad on the camera and they offered by parents to go and train with them\nBut they didn't really know much about myself but I wanted to give it a shot so my dad got me into the practice and they saw a lot of potential and they're like you know at Fifteen Years old and your polling this much do you ought to continue with it [laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLikely just going to evolve in that direction anyways\nWell maybe you're more optimistic than I Am certainly talked about this and vague terms I Want to commit them to build this bill is gone through several drops with the same kind of legislative draft ers who worked for the the government\nAnd I'm hoping they'll say this is it if they want to tweak it if they want to prove it and run with it nothing would make me happier but I Do not want this to simply linger it seems to me an issue that needs to be addressed because we are imposing burdens on hundreds of thousands of Canadians that simply should not have them going forward\nAs we look recall that Stephen Harper governance and posed mandatory minimum sentences in six months\nFor uh any pot possession of six plants or less a which I understand the number of people were affected by that we spoke with Jillian than he know that just while ago who is a minister in that cabinet too was supported those mandatory minimum sentences he's now\nIn the business he says that pot is a wonderful therapy for people and it's a great business opportunity what do you say to those who supported this in the past and now see it as an opportunity for them\nWell I'm not going to comment on business decisions that they made and what some would say as a slightly hypocritical position I understand that what you're suggesting but\nTruly this has to be something that the liberals and conservatives support this is something that we should all pass ideally by unanimous resolution if possible so we can write this injustice going forward\nDo you think that conservatives will support your bill\nYou know I've talked to a couple of them I'm the co chair of the justice committee and start dealing with the right people and uh I've talked to one so far and I hope that they will I think they get the basic point about the injustice and I'm hoping like me that they see that society has changed and the things that might have been\nTreated one way back twenty Thirty years ago is treated in a very different way today we've seen that all over the place in other areas as same sex activity there was an expungement bill of as you know in the last parliament that dealt with that and those people who had convictions for that activity I think although very different this approach is very analogous\nAll right we'll be watching Mr ... thank you thank you Murray ranking in the ... justice critic we reached ...\n[noise]\n\nIn Nineteen Twenty one a white mob attacked prosperous predominantly African American neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma known as black Wall Street and it's been called the ... massacre and it has been described as one of the worst instances of racial violence in the history of the United states\nOver the years there have been suggestions that there could be mass graves in Tulsa and this week the city's mayor said it would be investigating whether that was in fact the case\nMichele brown works at the Greenwood cultural center and gives historical tours about what happened in Nineteen Twenty one we reach ms Brown in Tulsa\nIs brown long has it taken until no for an investigation like this to happen\n[noise] you know that's a great question and I think that we finally have a mayor who is courageous enough to approach the situation in incident and to actually move forward and bring initiate the investigation\nWe're talking about an event from Nineteen Twenty one of the spring of Nineteen Twenty one that meant that mobs white mob set fire to hundreds of businesses and homes whole city blocks hundreds of people dead ten thousand homeless\nAnd we don't know the whole story so maybe just to start off tell us\nHow this began began quite simply didn't\nIt did and it's a story that was all too common\nDuring that period the inflammatory accusation that a young black man\nHad a salted a white woman and an elevator in broad daylight in downtown Tulsa when he got\nInto the elevator as he did every day as a ... boy he was given special permission to go into the dreadful building and get water and use the restroom everyday have encountered Sarah page on the elevator this particular day after the elevator doors closed and Dick role in this or a page or alone\nThere's a screen from the elevator the elevator doors open and Dick rolling\nTakes off running his later arrested and\nTaken to the jailhouse flash court house and the accusation is made\nThis our page had been assaulted and asked the story circulated throughout Tulsa throughout the day it went from claims that she had been assaulted to she was sexually assaulted by the end of the day they were claiming that she had been raped and this infuriated a mob of angry whites\nWho were determined to take matters into their own hands lynchings were all too common\nAnd whites began together in front of the courthouse angry and upset about what had happened about forty black man approached the courthouse initially and spoke with a sheriff\nAt that time and offered to help protect ... and he told them to going back to a Greenwood that he had everything under control and ... and would be fine so they did return to Greenwood but some estimates have that that there were as many as ten thousand whites\nThat had gathered in front of the court house last jailhouse later that evening angry and upset determined to take medicine to their own hands and a group of about a one hundred black men returned\nAnd this time a white man approached a black man with a gun and so what are you going to do with that gone he said I'm going to use it if I have to and they begin to struggle over the gun and during the struggle the gun goes off and at that point they forget all about ... page there's an all out battle in front of the courthouse blast retreat to the Greenwood district\nAnd whites slowly advance towards the Greenwood district eventually breaking through the barriers that African Americans had set up protecting their community but because they were so outnumbered and out gun\nEventually whites are able to overtake the blacks and invade their community and when they do so they invade\nUm Killeen looting stealing and within a short day by the following day more than thirty five square\nBlocks of property has been completely destroyed a thousand homes burned to the ground three hundred black owned homes of three hundred black owned businesses completely destroy and not only were they were shooting but they were also dropping nitroglycerine bombs from\nAirplanes that had been borrowed from um a local oil company\nAnd this has been described in two thousand and one report by the Oklahoma commission to study who's a race riots is that this was probably the only time that the United states has anybody community than bombs from the air\nThat is correct what\nDo we know about what happened to those those those those remains\nFor what we know is that the entire population of the African American community was ten to twelve thousand six thousand of those people were held in internment camps um\nThat left four to six thousand people on accounted for and we know that there were people that flat so there's no way of knowing exactly how many people lost their lives but we do believe that um the number is even higher than the three hundred that has been recognized we do not\nKnow that there were several mass grave sites that were set up and a lot of that is based on oral histories and what we have been told\nSurvivors we identified a hundred and sixty two survivors in Nineteen Ninety six\nThat began telling their stories but also from whites that want it to call and speak anonymously about the dump trucks that would drive through the streets of the ... district pick up dead bodies and then go dump them in the Arkansas River we know that there was a mass grave site in Oakland cemetery based on the testimony of a man\nWho happened to be a young boy at the time that the riot took place and he was playing in the area when he saw a group of white men\n... bodies into an open plot at
