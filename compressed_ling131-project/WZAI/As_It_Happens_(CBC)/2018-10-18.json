before going to bed to her I'll sleep\nWell we ex once we realize that the insects are and documented that with statistical analyses and so forth that the insects um we're much lower in abundance up to Ninety to Ninety five percent\nUm then in the seventies we certainly predicted that the upper levels of the food Web would also be declining to the insect divorce especially\nBirds frogs and lizards that eight insects would most likely if if your decades of research on on food Web dynamics were were correct would be in decline as well\nThat's what we found and we took a we we did our own senses of the Enola S. lizard populations I'm In the study area which I had done in the seventies but also we were very fortunate to have publicly available data from the very day long term ecological research program\nAnd many many field biologist had contributed to that database of\nBird ... says frog abundances up over the past Thirty years so we we looked at those and they told the story of the upper levels of the food Web there wasn't the to clients significant decline and birds and the frogs\nAnd the ... parallel with the decline in their food\n[noise] it it just I guess they the way to register how how consequential you research that scientists who have read it do responding to what you published are in shock\nAnd the extremely disturbing a research report did you has released in ... and we've seen this everywhere we sing declines in all kinds of animals and parts of the food chain why is it so much more significant spider Puerto Rico\nWell that's a great question yeah I'd like insects are declining globally um frogs\nHad been crashing and going extinct for the past Fifteen to Twenty years\nThat's thought to be primarily a fungus infection but the consequences I think are so a somewhat unexpected\nOf our study in that if it's replicate it and we need more data to keep healthy everyone that but it's true and these are complex system as we just did a little kid a rain forest um their indicators ended in Mexico and the tropical dry forests that Andres than I studied before\nThat a similar declined and insects as occurring but we need more data um so the implications however are truly frightening because this has been overlooked central a phenomenon that has\nProfound implications for the future of tropical rain forest\nIf the insects are found to be decreasing and other tropical forests and we are getting the effects on the food Web that we noticed in Puerto Rico then that is a major major another major negative\nComponent for the future of by a diversity and the preservation of of systems I think it was unexpected it's a\nIt's a rather unknown effect in tropical rain forests because people don't measure insects in them like that's just been true I think they just take it for granted that the tropics they're warm they're doing fine maybe logging um in some cases now pesticides would have an effect\nBut not this kind of extreme collapse\n... why why why do you think is happening\nIn ... yes\nWell ten years ago actually colleagues of our our as a ... um they predicted that tropical insects would be exquisitely sensitive to increases\nIn temperature and that was counter intuitive for many biologists including myself because just think oh wait a second they they evolve and hot arguments how's it going to be\nAffected by a couple of degrees of warning\nBut they showed that ...\nBut that was there for foreign out many laboratory experience pheromones Andres I went down to Puerto Rico to the first truly happening in the
