spoken about in the same breath as Albert Einstein and Marie Curie Donna Strickland is only the third woman in history to win the Nobel Prize in physics\nProfessor Strickland works on laser physics at the University of Waterloo she helped develop short intense\nApple's location when application of the technology is laser surgery she shares a prize with two other physicists we reached donors Strickland in Waterloo, Ontario\nProvincial Strickland you're having a bit of a busy day I think it's very busy day yes when you first got the phone call when you heard the phone ring this morning five Sunni am five five did you think it could be the call\nNo of course your first reaction is what's wrong [laughter] and then my second reaction would be who would calls at such a ridiculous hour and then then they say it's from Sweden so then you know\nAnd then so some point you got to hang up the phone and turn to your husband and say what\nWell even before that it was sort of like oh my goodness this is amazing who should we know and then um we both you know if he got up and and we did our kids knowing that they would not be awake um and my brother my sister\nThan I thought you know [laughter] I guess you get draft I don't know like I thought maybe I should get some food it before I have to do this press conference\nOr that's wild ... must be the craziest day for us if we could you you're working your way you do all your everyday you're getting up you're just you're pushing that ball up the hill and then this comes along that have not exactly exactly it's right out of ...\nAnd now it can be so for a big congratulations to you also for being a woman to win this because the Nobel Prize in physics has not been won by a woman in fifty five years is that is amazing I only did did you know that before you you learned\n[noise] well I guess I had never really thought about it you know so I I did not ... I'm I'm a big fan of Maria gaping Meyer who was the last one and um [noise] aside if it hadn't occurred to me that they hadn't been another one center\nAnd then the only one on the one before that was ... yes of course so\nI can really be you know I shouldn't be lined up with those two incredible women but anyway\nBut you are [laughter] [laughter]\nThat's a little bit of\nYou know it's interesting that we we spoke last month's with astrophysicist adjusts and Bill Burr now and she told us about being overlooked for a Nobel Prize she was she was one of the well a group of men and she was the only woman and they had a developed this research and posters the men won the Nobel\nAnd she said they when they press came to ask questions they asked the men about the science and they asked her about her measurements and her bra size and she had any boyfriends is isn't it late\nAt that point did you ... did you experience sexism and in science in the course of your career\nNot blatantly no I mean you know along the way you know I I've been told by you know men that I did better that you know I've ever been eaten by girl or you know how could a girl get that kind of mark you know that kind of silly thing but I just always think it's silly when they say\nWell you must have heard the Italian professor I was ... and at the certain conference okay\nI actually have missed that I should find time to listen to it because I've been asked to comment on it\nYou should listen you said that this was invented by men and built by men and becoming a nose turning against the men who invented it so this is your profession\nI see it and he just forgot to think about Marie Curie um you know I mean the fact of history that you know men did go to work and women stayed at home and so there were more men you know that's just that's just a fact I'm but obviously one should never you know\nObviously there's people that are making contributions and they should all be recognized\nAs talk about what you should be recognized where we're just tripped pulse occasion what is that in layman's terms lay woman's terms\nIt's the fact that ah at the time when we were doing this work\nCould have short pulse lasers or you could have high energy lasers\nBut you couldn't have shortfalls and high energy because of that peak power which you want in order to maybe blow up an Adam and strip the electrons right off the Adam are molecule\nUm if you did it if you ran a shortfall through your amplifier you would them blow up your amplifier and so this is why it didn't happen and so what tripped pulse amplification did and it's a very simple concept\nIs the fact that we realize now you have to ... to the polls first which\nMeans you stretch the pulse to be many you know or does it mean to be longer\nThan you can go had an amplifier because now it just seems like a long pulse of amplifier nothing happens to the amplifier\nAnd after that then you can ... it also does not destroy the um stretch that you put on it it maintains it and so you can go ahead and compress it back to the way it was except with all the energy and and now it's ready for the experiment but that but that didn't layman's terms that's really how to get\nThe shortfalls and high energy for the experiment but not inside the laser\nDramatically increased intensity of that post them that's right what what is it they will to do now that you were able to accomplish that what what would a applications is that\nWell of course many of applications for scientific right so this is why we started to study just how molecules and atoms are ionized under these\nOn to the Adams inside the latest field and so this was a new paradigm to work and it was a very few years after it was invented that somebody actually commercialized a few key laser for eye surgery\nThis is huge the millions of people have had corrective laser eye surgeries since this development\nBut they don't all have to get off the hook but millions half yeah it it is a huge it's probably the number one application I still\nLook come on you must be very proud of that\nYeah I mean and it it well I found it amazing that um it happened so quickly happened and that yes\nAnd it's made a difference of so many lives that's what you call that I can only do that no I Know that you pay the way this side of the way down the critical out here to be made I made it possible yes\nAnd ... and there's also a lot being made on Twitter that uh you Nobel winning scientist is an associate professor at Waterloo so when I write about I'm ...\nI'm very sorry that I think the anniversary it's been criticized for that but I just something that flight you know nobody told me not to know but you know actually I have colleagues male colleagues here called me I should you know it was time for me to be applying and I said I'll get around to that but I just never did\nAre you going to get around to it now\nI don't know why I kind of hoping maybe they'd ever she left and they'll just give it to me now [laughter] I don't know I got to figure out a lot of flak they'll they'll maybe helped me fill out all the forms that has to be filled\nBy the Nobel winning scientist or is that you probably a good enough reason to have an [laughter] to become a full Vassar\nI I just like to do things that I find ... they're not going to say I never found fun so that's why I didn't do\n... and again big congratulations to you so much things just speaking with us\nBy by\nWe reach associate professor Dona Strickland in Waterloo, Ontario she won the Nobel Prize in physics today and that was colonel mentioned in my conversation there professor strict ones Nobel comes on the heels of\nControversial comments by Italian scientist on his sons are strewn young enough to research organization CERN on friday Mr ... spoke at a seminar about gender issues in physics\nHe claimed as colonel said the physics was quote invented and built by men it's not my invitation unquote\nYou also said male scientists were being discriminated against because of ideology rather than merit CERN has issued a statement saying Mr ... Romeo was immediately suspended for his quote unacceptable remarks\nFrom imperial college London she attended a seminar we reached his way in London\nIs we had what was the most offensive thing you are listening to professor ... speaking the other day\nI think that my defense if ... if the tokens to say that physics was invented by a ... and it's not by invitation when actually women have contributed hugely to physics throughout the whole of history\nBut for an incredibly long time we haven't documented auto stories and we have to be very careful because we have to remember that it was only midway through the last three that women were even able to graduate from ready prestigious universities like Harvard or Cambridge and so that kind of huge impact on physics is only just beginning to happen now\nThis wasn't just some off the cuff remark that this professor made and that question period this was he gave a series of slides discussing is you can you describe some of the some of the the presentation he gave I Know you were in the room for that\nThat presentation had obviously had a lot of time taken over it and he had done to bake analysis of lots of publications and looked at the track record of men to women\nComparing that kind of time throughout that Korea and sharing the at the beginning of ... an amount of courage they have some the number of citations for different publications and then afterwards is deviate and changed the and men had most citations\nAnd ... huge number of programs and the whole way of academic publishing at the moment that is a big bias against women and also against on west and people in the fast ferry stages a pair of you\nNo I actually I was agreeing with you as not by reducing the number is by twenty percent or ... actually adding twenty percent more dollars to people who are actually coming here and that gives us a chance to integrate them better you see Quebec\nClimate is very Francophone so if we don't speak French it's very difficult\nTo talk about integration of new arrivals if we don't speak the same language if you can't\nBorrow a couple of sugar from your neighbor I mean so that's really what we're talking about we're talking about being able to live together being able to function and work within our province so it's I think a lot of people have a vested interest in throwing a random act stations at us I don't think it was entirely accurate to do so\nOkay but not just defense language test a values test to immigrants and that's fat that beat and being deportation failed that test that's\nActually the parental government doesn't have the power to deport so\nWe never asked a federal government to to do it for you but\nWe actually you know we never said that we would ask the federal government to do that reality is what we were proposing is that and it's just something that exists even within Canada that people who immigrate here are asked to adhere to creating values in general and that's the only thing that we were suggesting so we're not doing anything more or less than what the federal government's doing on its\nOwn and and all the whole nowhere where is there a test anywhere else in Canada for your values when you're Canadian values telling me when that happens\nImmigrants that want to come to Quebec are off a series of questions about how life occurs every day in Canada and our our position is very similar to that and we're asking them to adhere to basic values of a of\nYou know the sex is um do you do a same sex marriage rights very basic things I think anybody who wants to come to Canada should know that this is a place that welcomes diversity and that's basically what the question I wouldn't fault and anybody who ah wouldn't hypothetically pass it I think that would be extremely rare considering\nAnybody who wants to come here is manifestly wants to integrate within our society\nThat point we would simply say that we don't we will admit the credential that's required ... at that point a could could walk on them at welcome them anywhere and of course the charter of rights and freedoms would apply so I'm not overly concerned with that\nPosition and I don't find it took street and I don't think that we're anywhere near deporting and I think it's you know I don't think it's accurate to say that we could do that because provincial governments don't have the power\nOf the ... just to make the declassified this what we've heard ... is it there would be and this past would happen several years after the Iraq to see how does it would have been degraded land language that not too\nSlowly ... that were very welcoming to immigrants and we want them to succeed him are going to be very flexible\nAnd the way that we in the ... circuit selection certificates and of course right now we're in the process of forming are cabinet the premier elect is looking at you forming a his team and I think you know the new immigration minister is going to have the responsibility of clarifying exact rules but I mean I don't think that now is a good time to get into the details as\nTo what that would look like the future immigration minister is going to consult with about your crotch within the immigration department consult with our federal partners to make sure that we have some good but to be clear to seek you wants integration to see a cue wants immigrants to succeed and we want throw more money at making sure that they do succeed so actually I think our position is very open minded\nAnd I think it's going to look what ...\nWhat about wearing religious symbols slid restrictions will they be understanding the party would not want people in in the public service teachers to be wearing a over religious symbols is not the case\nSo we saw tuition so that has been ... we support the recent recommendation that was called the shark Hitler commission\nThe ... shark Taylor commission was a commission that occurred ten years ago within that report it was determined that the best way to proceed would be to prohibit overt religious symbols in positions of authority so anybody who was in the position to exercise the power of the state would be required\nTo or not wear overt religious symbols and see a cue believes that teachers in primary and high school are authority figures\nWould that religious and you tell the law is already the subject of a constitutional talent and so in the ... going to go further than that religious new talent you know\nWe're gonna have to see where that goes but I'm not going to speculate as to what we may or may not\nBut that I can also be those religious symbols that includes people who end crucifix is\nAnything that would be overt and religiously significant would be something that would be covered by which are typically Russia\nThis is an election for the first time in years and that that was not focused on Seventeen so what does that tell you about what come back and see themselves in ... and\nI think it tells us that we finally moved on it I think that's a great thing\nYou know for me I've been stuck in a in a in a world where are we to choice at a party that wants to stay with in
