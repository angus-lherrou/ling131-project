years ago we heard about summary executions\nAnd now of course there's the war in Yemen\nChildren in school buses were killed because they were caught in this war that the Saudis are waging in Yemen and there's an anticipation\nThat twelve million people will die in the next year from war induced famine this prime minister when he took office knew all about this contract he talks about confidentiality\nAnd he talks about penalties\nA he has been rather cavalier and\nI have these kinds of things I Want to ask\nYou about that because the prime minister says he's prevented from offering details but that there would be penalties in the billions if you cancel the contract what's your understanding of what the true price would be\nI don't know I have never been given any access to the contract\nUm but um he knows what is in that contract and I think that people should also recall that there's only a year left in the contract so the question is how many vehicles are still to be shipped what is the nature of the vehicles were not even sure that they're all labs\nAnd the fact that he knows yes fit terms or confidential but she knows on Monday he said it was going to be a billion dollars on Wednesday he said oh well I'm a billion dollars\nA was just a figure of speech and now he's saying possible penalties and the billions a thorough so um it it's very very unclear [noise]\nBut what is clear to me is that as signers of the international arms trade treaties [laughter]\nWe have an obligation not to sell to human rights defenders and the world is going to come after us and and make us live up to ...\nAt the same time these workers must be protected and I want to see a transition I Want to see something in black and white that's not confidential from this prime minister in regard to how he is going to protect these workers and make sure that they have the ability to support their families\nIf there is only a year ago and only so many left some of these armored vehicles to deliver what makes you so confident it's worth paying the price and the the the billions and penalties\nWhat price would you pay on twelve million lives twelve million people are expected to perish in the next year because of this war that the Saudis are waging we have to stand up and say this is wrong\nNow earlier this year though you weren't calling for those expert permits to be canceled you wanted them to be slowed down ... how did your mind changed on that\nI'm In terms of um ... what was going on I think that there needed to be clarity and it's interesting\nYou're talking about what was going on in Yemen\nWhat was going on in Yemen and there have been reports over the last a while and speaking with um with representatives from General Dynamics they kept assuring\nThat they actually went and inspected what was going on in Saudi Arabia and they were sure that there wasn't anything on toward a black cat clearly a cat is [noise] I guess more hopeful than a manner that true show\nIt can I just that's just so is it not somewhat naive to believe that when you're shipping these armored vehicles to whatever country that they will always be used for peace making purposes\nI think it depends on who your customer is and in this case it's a very unreliable customer if we were to find a customers among our NATO allies those who absolutely I Do not connect cash human rights defenses then we could feel a lot better in terms of of\nHow those vehicles are being used and I want to come back\nTo what I said initially these are probably the best vehicles in the world in terms of peace keeping and keeping peace keepers safe and that was I think always the intent in terms of the workers in London there's they saw this as something that we could be proud

there is a negative some Ninety percent of the media attention around this president is negative\nDespite historic a job creation despite the fact that our economy is booming despite the fact that trade deals that everybody said couldn't be made have been made despite the fact that the president is trying to solve law and order at our border and protect the security of Americans are from the east\nCoast to the west coast of north and south he does continue to focus only on the negative and that is there is a role to play yesterday the very first thing that the president did would come out and condemned the violence\nThe very first thing your network did would come out and accused the president of being responsible for that is not okay the first thing should have been condemned the

actual ... down that you constructed how big is that it's\nTen feet by ten feet by ten feet so it holds thirty thousand leaders of air which sounds like a lot but really isn't\nAnd and what did you have in there with you yeah so I had\nAbout two hundred plants which were the most important part and I had a lot of air monitoring and health monitoring equipment and I had a hammock to sleep in a bunch of food but Avi leaders of water\nYes there was encouraging but it is only a temporary bomb the issue came up because we're seeing a disproportionate amount of absentee ballots being rejected because of the signature and the question became win an election workers become can riding experts\nKnow you had an experience of your own where your voter registration was put in jeopardy can you tell me what happened to you\n[noise] yes uh in July of twenty seven chain I received a mail or it looks like something where you were request they pin from your bank but the thing that caught my eye was that it had a a fish of the\nUnited States postal service change of the address stick them on it so when I open the notice it said that we have indication that you have moved [noise] and\nYou need to fill this document out [noise] if you do not filled the form out within thirty days we will then move to them in an active roles\nNow that sentence\nClicked on a whole lot of Bell's in my head because you cannot place anyone on the inactive roles unless they have not voted and at least two federal cycle [noise] we had just voted\nSo there was no way they could put us on the inactive list we were being sent that those are legally we mowed within the same county\nAnd saying that ...\nOh the stress of that I took a picture of it I put it on Twitter uh the ACLU side they contacted me asked if they could represent me in a case and I I agree and I'm so thankful for that\nAnd we challenged secretary of state ... who's our chief election officer as well as my county ACLU decided to settle I wanted to take this to court but I was faced with a dilemma\nUh there were a hundred and fifty nine thousand who are in the same circumstances Eli than we were sort of in a limbo\nIn terms of the loop be allowed to vote so in order for myself and the uh the hundred and fifty nine thousand to be allowed to vote I agreed to take the settlement but I'm not happy with the outcome because Brian ... received no punishment\nRight and Brian Kemp as you say is George and secretary of state and the Republican candidate for governor he strongly denies that he's attempting to suppress the vote in any way what's your response to him\nMy response to him would be let's have a conversation because there are questions about my case that's simply do not fit the rhetoric that he would like us to believe I was not in an active voter but I Need to know why was targeted because the only thing I can think of I Am black\nI Am female and I tend to vote democratic\n[noise] well it's been widely reported that people most affected by this are and like you black or poor people what memories does that evoke for you and for many black people in Georgia\nOh for me that was so personal you know I own a civil rights baby um I grew up during the most turbulent times\nOf our history and I have a connection through my own family I mean everyone who is African American in this country we have a connection to the fight since you don't want me to vote you do not see me and it's not one person one vote is no person no vote\nDo you think the perception that you have and many other people black people uh especially that votes are being suppressed than this hurts the legitimacy of elections in the United states\nOh absolutely I'm a big fan of the Democratic process if anything should be nonpartisan this should be however throughout the country not just Georgia this has become a partisan\n... and the message that we as Americans can say to anybody else we have no right telling any other country\nYou know we're going to bring democracy cheer shorts when we cannot do this year my husband is on she's a veteran my daughter's a faction I've had people fight for this country\n[noise] put their lives on the line from don't you turn around and come to me and John me I'm not even worthy of voting and you're going to try to take something that is in the ... right\nNo I Will not stand
