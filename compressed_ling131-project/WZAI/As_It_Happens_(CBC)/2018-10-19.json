southern provinces they met with the commander of U.S forces\nAmong the dead is Abdullah ... kind of our police general had been the target of repeated Taliban attacks as a power broker general ... was considered essential by his allies including the United states and at one point Canada\nBut there were also reports that the generals power had some very dark ribs Matthew ... is a journalist to cover the rise of outdoor ... we reached Matthew Reagan's in New York\nNow he has you know there had been so many failed attempts to assassinate general Abdul Raziq how come this one was successful how did the assassination take place\nFor the details are still a little unclear but it appears to be um something has happened in any other high profile assassinations where there was an insult trader a the initial information saying one of the governor's bodyguard actually carried out the attack\nAnd this was the he was shocked and heading to a helicopter he was with members of the U.S military\nExactly this is a high level meeting with the top us general Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller\nA he was apparently out of harm's but outdoor I like the police people killed as was the um spicy or the province of them I mean and it's unclear what's happened with the governors on my waist up who but a ... at least for the injured if not killed as well\nBut the other day you can have innovation you can have new businesses that people can afford to buy your stuff and none of the existing policies that the government send about around are good enough to combat ongoing automation globalization effect I think government policies in those regards mostly failed to prevent this this reduction in fortunes for most of society\nThat you write in your letter that it said the issue that you see is that there is is hugely growing sector of our our workforce who are in low income jobs that day you described it there are five times as as many people\nSince Nineteen Ninety seven having minimum wage jobs but here's the question enemy if the if your your belief is that if people have more disposable income when it's all boats will float higher I mean that this'll be good for business why don't businesses\nW ... members helped make this live stream possible were grateful or their ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nProducts so why why should the government why don't you do it\nWell a lot of us are in fact on the ... that question came up in some of the some of the CEOs that spoke to the queen spark were for increasing minimum wage I I'm One of them some of them ... ... it would be better but let's look at the advantages of a basic income\nOver a minimum wage and not seeing that we should not increase minimum wage I think we should but at least income would be more universal so people caregivers are entrepreneurs people doing community service work people doing the economy work with all benefit from that versus minimum wage which only applies to a narrow sector of employment\nSo what's going on with the economy is that it's not that robots will come to take your job or what what is not like what happened to my dad an uncle who lost their jobs in Ontario manufacturing sector it today so today what's happening is that a lot of people just aren't being hired from the beginning\nWhich means which means there's not enough local demand is not enough local high paying work and all the experts I mentioned looking at the future of automation are saying that's going to get a lot worse\nAh so I think we need to look at ... as an economic issue none of social assistance issue it's the way to grow the economy create jobs make low paying work actually work for everyone so they can compete on a global level and they can actually find find work that suits best suits them\nKind of person to see you in your own family you know when you when you ...\nYeah I mean I I have a quite a few stories intersect with me I mean I grew up in a household that had a hot domestic violence I Wish my mom has the means to leave and I think if she had to be I think maybe she would we actually see that in in the seventies it the base can come in the U.S almost passed under Richard Nixon\nIt it passed in the house the Nixon was going to sign it into law except it some of the experiments running at the time in the U.S and Canada show to an end in significant increase in the divorce rate among married couples who have basic income because women were able to leave abusive households and frankly I think that's a good thing we also see not happened in the trials\nIn Africa and Kenya right now a report of a greater marital harmony uh we've we've seen in the trials in India for instance women in the villages are taking off their head pieces like dressing more liberally and telling that the researchers that The Elders and the village can't control them any more\nSo when I think we can come as deeply emancipated for women but for everyone because imagine if anyone imagine if you as the listener\nKnew that you would never start if you have this\nNo shame or on the money is if everyone gets it if it's universal the weight roads and and and police protection at hospitals are universal there's no shame and using that money\nTo to stock chick take a breather ... think of your life and figure out what you want to do next I imagine the confidence to self reliance the the ambition which we can unlock the entrepreneurship it can release if everyone can take a long term perspective on your life\nWill be watching to see if the Ontario ... responds to hear that in ... she had speaking with you thank you thank you very much\nFloyd ... organized the campaign CEOs for basic income we reached him in Toronto\nAnd we received a statement from Ontario ministry of children community and social services it reads in part quote the government for the people has committed to a one hundred day review of social assistance and poverty reduction strategies in Ontario to best assist the one in seven people in the province who are living in poverty\nPlan is expected on November eight twenty Eighteen unquote\nWith about a year to go before the next federal election the conservatives are on a push to introduce or reintroduce I guess their leader to Canadians and that means that you are going to be seeing and hearing a lot more of Andrew sheer when this weekend\nThe Sunday Edition will be airing a wide ranging discussion between Mr Sharon Michael end right\nInterview covers a lot of ground here's a patch which in which Michael asks\nThe conservative leader about the disappearance and apparent murder of Saudi journalist Jamal ...\nThe most concerning uh international issue at the moment facing Canada would face you prime minister of course is the the murder the butchery of ... I'm In the Saudi consulate in\nIn a is them will be fewer prime minister how would you respond to that would you cancel any arms deals we have with Saudi Arabia\nWell you know I have to uh I have to be conscious of the fact that I don't have the same levels and briefings that the liberals have in the primary strategies aware much more\nOh just briefings and things like that I Believe though that this incident should be a wakeup call uh about uh the governance Saudi Arabia and about it's it's um [noise]\nAh it's the role it's playing in the world\nI'm I've been reading a lot in this recently and uh it is very disturbing when you look at what the Saudi Government has has has done in this case the the cover up to follow that\nAh that this is alarming everyone should be concerned about this is that the idea that had happened in a in another country not not in Canada not to a Canadian\n... the Saudi Government plays a very significant role in geopolitics uh there are a lot of concerns about the the sanctioning of of of terrorist groups and and and where the money flows a lot of that has come through\nA entities within within that country and I think this we all need to get together as as as western democracies liberal democracy I should say western because the fact structures all around the world for freedom loving nations should all come together and say we've got a big problem\nHere we can't government to act with impunity in this fashion gruesome horrific ah doesn't begin to describe what happened and there's an excerpt\nOf conservative leader Andrew shooters conversation with Michael end right which will be on the Sunday Edition this weekend you can hear the full interview on Sunday [noise]\n\nYou know\nIn the festivities in Toronto park yesterday there was one character who stood out a tall furry creatures that bore a striking resemblance to poke through the BLM character from the long running TBO children's program Pocono door\nBut it was four twenty on legalization day in Canada so the creature was not poker room at all it was ... go to the creation of mark Scott who used to play poker roulette special promotional events we reached Scott in Toronto not\nFor those who didn't get a chance to see him letters took a look like\nWell tofu rule would be a play on the iconic ... which I created a parody of and is a character who will talk about responsible drug use now that Canada has legalized candidates\nFor recreational use there can be more discussion about response\nBut for getting to the description Doug looks like poker for people who have not seen ... who don't have kids when does poker who look like\nWell poker room is a poker dotted kangaroo from a show called ... outdoor\nVery popular with everyone who has kids knows about ... ... and it was about ... [laughter] he didn't know about token now so this is that this is what you you were ... and you I took them\nYes I was the um\n... out of ... land for TV oh and they're affiliated agencies and I got to meet the queen as poker rue I'm Colin Powell came to bring a program called America's Promise with a little red wagon as their symbol\nAnd um ... when he had his twenty fifth anniversary Saturday Night at the movies I I got to be part of that\n... that now we never got to hear your voice which is really odd hearing it now\nWell yes because poker room or in most of the time until Nineteen Ninety six when he came out of re land talking was a\nSort of in some way and when I was told to talk of was given the instruction to be kind of like Julia Child and Kermit the frog [laughter] so it was a [laughter] and yes mostly insinuating like the summers in their day\nRight now of course we didn't imagine ... ah smoking a giant split with\nOne of those ships which the Trudeau government did do and that's quite public that deserves a fair I'm an open transparent release of documents because uh charges brought against a very fine Canadian Mr Norman the second highest ranking officer in the military\nHas been charged in relation to it so he deserves that trend\nThat transcript I don't know what's in it I was not at the cabinet table for the liberal cabinet I was in the conservative I I think all of it should be released and Canadians can see what was discussed on on all counts\nAnd with the icy and he has time to devise admiral Norman with is criminal reached the test for allegedly seeking to keep the day the contact on of course you have your colleagues in jest of these ... based on\nUm I have learned through the media that there were investigations into leaks of cabinet secrets surrounding the ... who Trudeau cabinet and their decisions and that apparently some cabinet documents were leaked but charges were not brought for breach of trust against some other civil servants it appears that\nThere was a targeted campaign against admiral Norman he is the one facing trial no one else is even though the investigation revealed there were several leaks around liberal decisions on on ship building he deserves\nAs any Canadian would a full answer in defense writes both under section seven and eleven of the charter it you know the the Trudeau government uh talks a lot of a sunny way\nHave the ability to ensure that all documents released we don't care what's in them that will be determined by a court so that he can get a fair hearing\nAnd they know the story was originally published by CDC news journalist at that time was James cut more who went to work for a defense minister ... ... just weeks after that story was published is that what you're referring to\nThere that's part of the intrigued with this story ... ... you know Mr cut more who reported on defense issues and have served briefly in the armed forces I Believe\nWas aware of of some of these discussions then went worked internally I Know he wouldn't have been at the cabinet meetings what we're driving at his word or any discussions involving a Mr Bryson Mr Trudeau other members of the cabinet with respect to this contract where they advancing concerns that they'd heard from interested parties all of this\nDeserves transparency I think ah\nWhen someone's reputation and literally there's liberty is on the line we should air in favor of making sure his charter rights are respected\nThe vice admiral Norman is represented by Murray hadn't and very very good defense lawyer with a reputation for success or is it possible that this political interference story is just a pie in the defense ... down in the ... case against declined\nThere's no question he has very capable council and in fact Mr Goodell said today in the house that our system works when things are left in the hands of defense counsel the trouble is the liberal governments are tying the hands of defense counsel by not providing documents that are central to the case\nIf the trust that was breached in this case is the trust and confidence around decisions are cabinet sorry you have\nTo release those documents to see if indeed trust or minutes or cabinet memos were leaked the government can't have it both ways they basically ran a very respected senior officer out of the military on a rail I respect the fact he's standing up for his reputation he wants to return to duty\nIf the liberals are prepared to release these documents they should ensure that the charges were dropped because it's a farce\nI
