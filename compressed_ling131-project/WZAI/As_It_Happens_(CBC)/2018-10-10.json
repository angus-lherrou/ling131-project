news and information you rely on everyday support double UCI at Cape and islands dot org\nCategories but actually it belongs to a third category according to an e anti disinformation website this video was staged and it is crumbling propaganda Nikolai ... is a reporter and a video producer with mashable dot\nCom [laughter] when I first of all what kind of on line reaction and comments has this video provoked\nWell first of all before people figure it out of there was a fake video it received quite a substantial coverage in terms of western media everybody was jumping on sort of the ... of a you know this woman in Russia actually as a in preparation\nFor this ... you had just opened Google and I and I wrote viral spreading video I just wanted to see which ... which article that are going to be first and actually you can still see\nThat the majority of the articles in the Google Search or remain the the videos that don't know that it's it's actually a staged a stage protest or or said process so that's actually quite interesting\nHow do you know let's say ... what what what was the evidence that was presented that say that this was a fake story and that this man's betting thing was just staged\nI first watched what seems really strange is that the female blogger in in the video the female blogger that's talking about this and that staging this a protest or has been known in Russia to do this in the past but unlike this uh particular video she has\nBrought a serious issue is like a you know ups courting and other forms of you know sexual assault that women in Russia and faith and what what struck me about this video is that the tone was very differently and it was almost the grass isn't the way that she was approaching so cold man spreading a\nPeople on on the subway and it it just seems a little bit off in how she was trying to prove a point about an issue like man sprinting which was an entirely different ballpark to ups courting once the article on the eve this information side came out the evidence that they give\nFor it being fake is that he was actually published by a an outlet that's owned by Russia Today which is a you know a media outlet that's\nDirectly owned by the Kremlin or the outlet it's called the now which used to be a show on the arts website which now its own sort of vertical and it's quite popular on Facebook and that's where the the video that when most viral was posted and that's at that video actually still is on line or there are other versions of the video that\nI've been taking down but the original video or Facebook video is actually still on Facebook and I think at the time that I checked it had like six million views\nI wasn't do part of the debunking that uh the men who are in it because if people haven't seen the video\nMen are sitting man's spending on the subway the legs are a part she's next to them or standing above them she pours this liquid into their lap say look startled looks at how did we come to know that these were actors who are paid\nThere's there's an online magazine in ... in St Petersburg called ... and uh they\nHosted some interviews with one of the men who appeared to video who said that he was actually paid and subsequently other other testimonies of people of men into video posted online on social media thing uh you know that they appeared in the video and there were a couple of\nPaid actors and I think the exact posts with you know you ... you come in for a job with ... and you and you leave with money in your pocket um and then what you know once once the sort of the investigation got a little bit deeper it turned out that potentially get this video was filmed by um\nBy a studio that that are known to have worked with Archie and with the Kremlin end up in the past so the connections become you know more and more clear that the deeper you look\nWhy would this be of interest as Kremlin propaganda why what what's why why this sounds like a a not a large issue for the state government why why would they they ... how to find something like this\nIt's one of [noise] it's it's it's sort of like one of many uh issue said they tried to sort of like\nSport debate and and and sort of their anger and the reason why we're talking about it's just they got caught and that's the thing that I think it's different now than let's say\nTwo or three years ago and uh what the video was basically trying to do it is trying to show how a woman is you know is going too far she's being aggressive in in sort of\nProtecting our so called you know in in quotation marks or her feminist sort of philosophy and an eight that only goal is to is to store I'm anti feminist sentimentality in in in people around the world particularly people in the west but it's also\nYou know once this goes back to Russia you know allows politicians\nFor example to it's a talking point where they can go back and then sort of\nStarts to pour it into more conservative parts of the country I think there was one politician one uh from from putting his party who said really nasty things about this uh activists in about ten minutes and journalist so it allowed\nAbout how important is to keep a conservative society and how we shouldn't be like misled by liberal or a radical liberal sort of ideas like ... and things like that\nWhen you said that that when he checked on line ... ... now you found that some sites don't seem to know that at stake but do you think it's more the case that they don't care that they're not talking about mainstream media but do you think that there is it a point now where it doesn't even matter if it's too as long as it's effective\nYes um I think I think\nSo I don't know if it well I don't know if the desired effect is actually achieved I Know that the the article that day you ... uh I added a comment that had fourteen thousand like a it's sort of proof that people are are getting kind of enraged\nBy this to buy the staging acting that ... has started some ... minutes a sentiment I\nTo be honest I think we shouldn't place too much emphasis on on these kinds of attempt at propaganda they they are they are plentiful and they exist across confident in in in in Europe and in in the U.S I don't think\nOr or a sort of like a start to worry too much about you guys have a kind of the truth is that the the Kremlin is attempting you know different kinds of propaganda a disinformation campaigns and if it if it's sort of a hit or miss rather than have a central a central I sort of a strategy\n[noise] All right we leave it there ... thank you thank you\nAnd ... is a reporter and a video producer with a mashable dot com we reached him in London, UK we have more on this story on our website CBC dot CA slash a I
