country knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to be okay but what looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people think\nIt's Donald Trump talking about the disappearance of Saudi journalist ... today walking Castro is a democratic congressman and member of the house foreign affairs and house intelligence committee we reached him in San Antonio Texas\nWas rescued migrants you say the idea is to bring them to put to allow them to get out and to make the refugee claim why he's confident that will happen\nOkay maybe I'm not confident that will happen I mean I think that that's the intention of course of the mission if it weren't going to happen and the Italian government were to block it illegally that would be unimportant act to protest so I guess one has to plan for all such eventuality is\nSo is this launches this ship is this as much a political statement and political action as it is a rescue mission\n[noise] I think it it first and foremost a humanitarian effort but I think it also has a pedagogical\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the

certainly know there are many Italians who ... who want to help and we've covered the stories and spoken the some of those people and but it's the Italian government has has the support that's doing this and so are you looking for a confrontation the Italian government over this\nIs certainly not the intention of the projects to seek a confrontation but one would be naive not to prepare for such possibility you know so there is a legal team standing by there are\nNo plans to what to do so I don't think that seeking confrontation with the government or fully says really\nSeem to me like a useful tactic but once you shrink from it either\nI think that we still have to stand up for what we fix right\nWhat about the people who beyond that but what about those migrants to possibly by hundreds will be on a boat or you or are they are they do become ... and ... and then on an\nAbsolutely not and that's why I said before that I think the the obvious and first purpose of such a

Web page CBC dot CA slash\nAge [noise]\n\n\nIt was referred to as the hardest test you've never heard of ... worked for years before they take it they often fail on their first try and on the second and third\nNo twenty three one experts who passed the master ... exam this fall have lost their designation the exams given by the court of master ... is the group is stripped the titles because it discovered someone leaked information about the ones on the tasting exam\nThe court has a little else about the cheating scandal [noise]\nHorton issue is one journalist who worked as a ... and some of New York's top restaurants we reached her in New York\nCourtney first of all what does it mean to ... to get this title of master ...\n[noise] it's probably the most lauded achievement that you could have in the ... mile it's certainly not necessary for our summer yet but the people who become ... worked for years and years to achieve this goal\nAnd then to lose the people you have been talking this last is what what did they say these\nI mean it's really devastating I have to say everyone I've spoken to let you still in a lot of shock um\nAnd they're really surprised because something like that has never happened before and I actually considering that twenty three of the twenty four master some way to pass this year had work to pass this tasting portion it's usually the most difficult\nPiece of the ... to pass\nSo it's really ... not only for them but for the entire like ...\nAnd the exam is notoriously regrets all three parts of it which is I guess there is a knowledge based part there is a practical part and then there is the most difficult part which is that the tasting portion of the exam just described for people what it entails\nYeah absolutely and that's the only exam itself\nIs the highest for level that you can achieve within the court is ... so you have to pass your introductory certified and\nAt that exam which can take several years so by the time that you get to see her master's only exam first you have to pass Erie a separate gay and then on a later date\nI'm a service exam which also includes questions that you may be given on the floor as ... as well as the tasting exam which is six lines that you must blind taste in twenty five\nTwenty five minutes six wines you're blindfolded or you're you're you're you can't see what you're doing and you have to identify what\n[noise] so you're not blindfolded you can see the winds in front of you it's usually three white\nAnd three red but you must go through each of the wind systematically assess the site the aromas and the power of the line and then based on what you're tasting you must come to a conclusion on where the wind is from what the great variety is and what vintage the wine is from as well\nWhen you consider like they say that most people ... who can't tell the difference between white wine and red wine is really extraordinary what they have to know\nYeah absolutely and so this part of the things I'm this is the part that has been called into question what exactly happened\n[noise] so we really don't know the quarter master suddenly as America's has not released too much information on what\nSpecifically happen all we've been told is that a current master ... released information that was\nPertinent to the tasting flights\nOf the exam so we don't know if that was before during or after the exam because the candidates are never told what the winds are even after\nThe exam we don't know if they reveal the identity that the wind if they just gave them some clues as to what might be on the exam we really don't know and they have that release any additional information about that\nBut he canceled the exam results of the taste portion or the whole exam\nJust the tasting portion and they have a invalidate the results for everybody so that means is that everyone who took the tasting portion of the exam whether they passed or failed now has the opportunity to reset the exam\nWhat did the people who did the exam what did they go sue to get to the point where they were doing this test\nI mean it is a huge time and financial investment to study for the masters on my example particularly the tasting portion of the exam because you have to taste a lot of wind in order to be able\nTo pass this exam I Know that in the film this on film that came out a few years ago\nSome estimated that they spent as much as twenty thousand dollars on\nFor their exam and the person who is suspected of having given this confidential information to those taking the tests ... whatever he or she went through to get there is this is a huge risk lead to lose a lot that's been last year I Would imagine\nAbsolutely one I've spoken to other ... for the piece that I wrote in seven fifty daily they really\nWeren't boggled at why somebody would want to cheat the system because it is such a high honor why would they then want to undercut the name by giving someone else information that allows them to cheat the exam\nYou know when we're trying to get someone to talk to us about this uh people refused to do an interview ... a Sunday doesn't want to talk you agreed does that surprise you that so many people don't want to even discuss this\n[noise] it doesn't surprise me that those who had gained the title of master ... and now we're having it taken away from them it doesn't surprise me that they don't want to talk at at this point because I think for many the emotions are still raw and they also so badly want to keep this title\nThat they want to think before they say anything publicly because one day they may be members\nAgain in this organization for me I feel confident speaking about it both as a former ... and also because I had spoken to others and I would like to give voice to them if they cannot do so themselves\nExplain a bit more of this because it seems that the court is saying is that because of the divisions powers Canadian system that the courts cannot interfere with legislation that's not passed that this idea that the federal government must consult with first nations drafting ...\nThey're saying that while you can take the federal government to court after it's passed a law and say that that's unconstitutional violation of treaty rights\nThat the courts can't into the you're doing that legislative process is that what they're saying\nIs that is what they're saying but I I totally disagree with that I totally disagree because one is the last time any legislation there's been overturned that impact inherent rights of our people never and you know a lot of lip service that they do a very good at it when the liberal government came into power\nPrime minister Justin Trudeau\nSaid the most important relationship that he wants to have is with the first nations well that's nothing but ... says the that the liberal government has a give us a nothing but lip service to\nThe elections coming soon they're going to come back and uh trying to get support from the first nations chances\nAre first nations are are going to stronger and get together and and not support a liberal government\nAnd the the relationship right now it's a it's a it's damage as if ... well it's got to be a lot of work to be done on on on a part of a the federal\nYou want them to do and and this is not just in this case that let's say in the development of what's below the poverty level in Alabama ... what do you try to stop them from developing in or or what what level do you want to see an end in an intervention\nWe want to be part of a of this uh the development we want to be part so that is manageable but they don't have the green light to start to destroy our land and and destroyed a fish habitats and\nOur waterways and uh we we we want to have a say in what goes on and through our\nRace as directed by the federal government to make sure that we have something to go forward with for for many years to come and we've never been heard\nWe've uh you know the two thousand and five case with a minister a sheet of cops are department trying to take up plans we reach out and then we won that in the Supreme Court so you think that this one should have been easier to make for for ... court\nSo uh I feel that the Supreme Court judges or didn't want to make that decision based on whether they get a backlash from a from the rest of Canada and the federal government doesn't matter which what's a party is in power\nThey've always kept a the general public in a dark they don't know that they're part of the treaty\nAnd that uh they're benefiting more from the tree you didn't know the frustrations are\nAsked at the beginning when you go from here I've seen that in the Supreme Court ruling on this a national chief Hey Don ... is saying that where it takes you is into the carts over and over again that this is just going to be lots of court cases lots of lawyers lots in consultations this is this is the future\nWhile let's just put it this way just wait and see what happens because uh I don't think we we have any faith any court system and in this country anymore and uh\nYou know things are going to change and a half in really a don't speak for the nation's I'm very saddened at the national chief\nWould be working closely with uh I Know to try to push a they're a an extra gender who basically erode our treaty rich so uh I I have no uh I have no faith in the in the system today\nAnd says you say the sleeping giant lakes yes she's quarter a thank you very much
