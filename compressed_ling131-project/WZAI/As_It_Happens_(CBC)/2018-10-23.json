I was groped in the back\nOf the car there were two other people there um and the other two were not anything I had remembered one was another groping which had happened at a at a dance and the other was um [noise] he had said he had kind of\nA close the door and a bathroom while we were in their together and it would not let me until I kissed him which he said I did so I wrote him back and said you know I I don't remember these things I Believe you\nBut I don't remember them and I felt it was really important each and kind of ironic if you think about it that I felt I\nNeeded to say to him I Believe you know\nWhich is just a bit over a year old now we've seen many men apologize after being public laid out it and for you what was it like having this experience of someone apologizing without having been named her shamed or in some ways sort of forced into it\nYeah so so there are two things about his apology one was um and this really did hit me with the fact that she did not have to do this I mean he could have and I wrote this in the ... the follow up piece that I that I wrote he could have read the piece recognized himself and thought I Wonder what's for dinner tonight\nYou know and and he could have been quite confident that I Would move on with my life as I have for the past Thirty years and not you know really talk about it anymore and he didn't have to fess up and also the kind of\nTone and content and his apology was it was exceptional it was complete vulnerability\nHe did not say you know I did this thing but I and I I was just a kid or I didn't know any better or that's just how it was back then he said I did these things he lifted them very very clearly\nHe said I have no excuse I feel terrible I have thought about this in the intervening years\nI've always wanted to reach out to you\nAnd apologize and he just said I'm Sorry\nYeah well and obviously he there was a level of trust with you and for him to be able to do that on some level I mean one of the things that struck me um in in reading your column about this is you don't say whether or not you accepted his apology\nTo the the the last line in in in your column and when you receive you're talking about receiving the apology and you you're right and that is something I can guarantee I won't forget\n'em why did you choose not to let us know when and of course I'm curious do you accept his apology\nYeah so I I Do accept it I Do accept it and I think that's a big\nWay forward in terms of the me too movement I don't think all women need to need to let all men off the hook for their actions mhm and I\nI don't believe that however I\nThink there is a lot of there's a lot of power that women have in freeing men who are able to come to the point that this man with it\nYou recognize around to address that wrong be making making apologizing okay I think it's a really powerful and\nLeslie thank you so much for talking with me today\nThanks for having a little

uh just the early turnaround are leaving this morning but I'm looking forward to a bit of a break here and I'm sure I'll feel great after a couple of weeks\nGoing into this race this is your first marathon you had had a great career before this point but a marathon is completely different um what were your expectations\nI knew um I was a very fit and ah I thought\nIf things went well like it a good time maybe get close that record but it's like you said the marathon it's feast and they're just so many things can affect it outside of your control and especially being my first one is very very unknown to me\nWhy did you want to go from reading shorter distances to running the marathon\nI think it's a natural transition for a lot of this the athlete's foot myself running the five getting picky on the track but for me I had very\nThe ankle in the middle of twenty sixteen and\nUm I actually had some difficulty doing track where it goes from that point on just handling the corners of track and so it was just sort of a natural fit but I could do a little workouts that marathon required a little bit easier it was just easier on my body as a result I just a really took to the training and\nAs a continued on I I Love the preparation and I'm ... now\nIn that recovery I mean you had it as you mentioned serious injury um do you run for a long period of time were you concerned that there was a point that maybe you wouldn't be able to run at all\nI don't think I ever faced that but I think that was very serious concern\nWith the surgery I mean you can never do you want to come back from something serious like that back can't be an option but I I had serious doubts at different points in my recovery of vote whether you wanted to continue to do this you know it's very hard road to come back from\nThis record drone drains record stood for forty three years and people have gotten close to the records they've almost beating the record and then because of the marathon and the fact that it's a long race and anything can happen some things have happened and it's falling apart at what point in the race yesterday did you start to think seriously that you might have it in your size\nThe reality is I didn't know exactly how close I was into probably the last few kilometers and I knew with an absolute certainty that I had it with about five hundred meters less but up to that point it was\nAnything could happen I can completely blow it so but yeah by that point I was definitely just enjoying it they knew then\nThat was a runner now marathoner can lemons
