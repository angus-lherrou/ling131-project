Ontario\n... vodka made from the cows now it tastes like\nA it's a style well my opinion is fantastic it's a much of a standard fog\nBut with absolutely no burned the sweet smell and the uh currently finish leaving no burn a few of the box with college date but a ... often have it out to kill them sort of\nTaste to it which many people don't like\nA ends on when you drink it burns going down but ours has none of it's a very slow as expensive\nAs it sounds like nail polish remover right\nExactly yeah you were going to say [laughter] quite sibling delicately so what is it looked like they look like milk\nOh no it completely clear just like a like a ... Philip to Ninety four percent of all dirty\nBring it to ... percent alcohol so you could mix it with all your favorite cocktails by what people are telling us is that it's good to sit on its own which is pretty rare and about\nIt and made this with regular milk or or what part of milk is he using can make the back\nSo we're using um called ... so what happens is the milk comes into the new processor from all the harm to our case we're working with part why\nThey have the largest protests are about an hour South Florida what the facts are taken off to may ... ice cream and then there was a skim milk\nAnd what they do to make it cheaper to ship the pro teams skim milk they concentrate them by taking out the water and when they do that they also take out\nThe lactose minerals and vitamins and that liquid is called no home yet and what's interesting is right now they have very little use for it and the vast majority of it stopped and that's what we're turning into all\nSaid there's no ... this is their the farmers just get rid of it is just think this is a waste of panic tens of nothing no can tease and and better production\nStuff right I I don't like to call it a waste but it's something that's being wasted right now but uh but no triggered all the sugars\nIs Matt and Matt's right now the farmers actually have to pay for those safe disposable of this because black person's harmful to the environment so it's an environmental problem it's a financial problem because if it costs to dispose of it also don't want that wants to see a good portion of what comes out of the cat wasted\nHow do you turn it into alcohol well\nThat's where uh we work with the University of Ottawa with a professor there in the biology department to hide I ... that can prevent a lactose for the most ... east won't eat it but you know Steve how are you will consume the lactose and party softball\n[laughter] so ... in ... I think that's like that like any other alcohol\nThat's right well it comes in we actually gonna milk truck that pulls up here are they pump it into our from entering should we have a large and it was still for veterans we fill that up with permanent or we pitch in our ...\nThey get to work with take about three or four days to divert the toes into alcohol then we put into our students when we purify the alcohol right up to Ninety four percent\nAnd then uh we don't do that with water to make that bought out bought\nIf something were lactose intolerant can they drink this\nOh that's a great question no not at all so the Big East will clean you leave\nI'm an equal sugar it's absolutely no lactose in the final product\nAnd is it something you have to refrigerate\nI Do know that uh I've been out there just very only defense cuts are being made from a from the\nSo and not respect since ... variations like it's like ... guys that ... the less nail polish remover and and do you drink and ... do you mix it with something that's what's what what do you what are your recipes at this point\nWhere you can make said and we found that it mixes are obviously very well with milk from the ... are also make concrete which are so think of a bally's part of one hundred percent but there is something we're working on and and but also for his ... feedback as\nPeople like it just uh on ice so uh it's very versatile\nThey make a wet Russian I presume very white Russia [laughter]\nOf course you're talking about dairy because as a new trade agreement with the United states and what that means to dairy farmers they're quite upset about that is ... is something that dairy farmers can provide how do you think that that affects the dairy industry\nWell like for example right now the alcohol on the street was the largest purchaser of voluntary are great\nAt right now the alcoholic freak outs purchased from there so uh if we can make this a particular we could become a a significant source of revenue for for dairy farmers which as we mentioned orange is huge pressure right now so if you want to support the dairy farmer ...\nYes it was it was or is and how did you deal with all the time\nAh to tell you the truth ah I think I was still pretty much living on adrenaline and uh uh as Peter said and the and the song I I felt like I had nothing left to lose a so I'm not normally is maybe a brave or for hardy\nAs I was as far as exposing myself to in order to possible dangers back then\nYou call yourself you said I'm I'm and then nothing left to lose club I think you said in our interview\nRight right well there were a lot of us are back in the day I mean I was um when there were a lot of people who have lost children in the war and uh that's what we call ourselves\nBut you you came to this point is that of forgiving I was in Cali at not immediately this is something that was it princess it took some months about half a year and you're describing that to us when we spoke to you in two thousand and six and I just wanted to play a bit of what you said at that time\nI never asked for much for the\nWork force\nFirst [noise] a lot of Catholic I'm not a Christian [noise] very much worse\n[noise] at least in two thousand six Michael what did that course teach you that forgiveness\nWell I think one of the biggest things that that taught me was that to forgive someone is not to condone what they did I certainly don't condone what what Cirque our dead\nBut it's basically I ... I Would say is you know not to have a noted is process um the sister sister ... who taught that course at ... said\nUm forgiveness is like quitting cigarettes sometimes you have to do it over and over again so it's you know it's a ... it it it is a process and uh she was just so great in presenting things in such a way that anybody\nCould could accept them and explaining the nuances of the differences between condoning and forgiving and and other things that people often confuse an ultimate way\nForgiveness isn't for the person being forgiven it's for the person who's doing the forgiving and it it changed my outlook on life in general\nOn my relations with people especially people close to me and ah you know it's it's it's still a tremendous factor in my life\nIt fair to say that that could change the course of your life\nIt certainly did that's very fair to say\nAnd Peter I I think it's safe to say that you interview Michael's words changed your life didn't [noise]\nUh yeah they did [laughter] I just got a Muslim just listening to do it again and um I I mean it's it's funny just listening to it in today's times uh twelve years later and and realizing that that message is still more important than ever I'm not the time I was listening to Michael and as I was listening to this you know\nI just wasn't expecting the way that it was going to unfold and then the reaction that he was describing and as you know what I found out later in the interview that people call them a coward and had shot at him I just said I said hang on [laughter] you know the the the message at this\nMost courageous brave choice I've ever heard somebody ever make [laughter] and it felt like the antidote to this\nEscalating hatred that was was happening in the world and just listening to it again today I'm just like it's still the answer [laughter] it still remains the answer it still remains more important than ever so\nDo you start buddy you remember the details date the situation in which you listen to to Michael in this interview\nYeah I was I was driving along in my car and and a Canadian musician spent a lot of time driving across Canada a lotta time listening CBC and and I would always listen to as it happens and\nAnd you know just one of those things that's on and you're listening to it and you're taking it in but it's one of those interviews that I just kinda zeroed in on as I clued into what was being said and and to me the part that I was very moved you know just by Michael's reaction in of itself I was very unexpected reaction\nBut what really kind of joke to me into action was was the fact that you know like I said the people shot at him and and and called them a coward and just put him through\nEven more held and then I ... I don't have a son I don't know what it's like to lose one let alone under the circumstances that Michael last Nick I'm so when I found out that that people were doing that to him I just said\nThat to me is just just unconscionable and I need to do something about that and and I need to somehow amplifies message and and yeah the you know the context of it was you know ... or ... was this target and they were like hey we got 'em and yeah a victory um you know mission accomplished that kind of lingo and you know they were using\nA I mean I I I don't want to speak for Michael on this but they were using neck in the murder of ... or ... as as a reason to justify what they were doing\nPrevent yeah and the lyrics as your son I'm just going to read the the course then we're going to hear it later on so people know they're not going to miss that so I guess I'm going to have to try forgiveness because men you know that's all that I've got left my boy did not deserve this but neither do the rest\nI guess in line to have to try forgiveness ... how did those words continue\nThose words came to me right away [laughter] um I think I pulled over and wrote down those words and then as is often the case for me with with writing I I kind of have the initial thing and then I knew I needed to be with that because sometimes the the sort of surface reaction is is not deep enough and I I immediately just\nCared about it so deeply and I and I knew that I was going to be\nDo you do it properly um it wasn't just about channeling my own feelings about it I really want it to amplify his voice that was the goal so I wrote those words down and then I actually um ended up seeking out to a copy of the interview that you guys had done and I I transcribed it\nI'm just so I could kind of practice putting words together in the way that Michael put words together\nAnd really then just kind of work from there and very carefully put it together\nAnd Michael ... when you first heard this on what was your reaction\nOr are as a reserve recall him ... turtle we overcome that are\nIn light of all the negative reactions though I had that someone would have such an understanding of what our men and visceral crime doesn't serve\nA generous and a and there's respect or just overcame may still does every time I hear\nThe two of you became friends didn't you did or what was the friendship based on was it just a moment you didn't you did you find it to the to a deep replaced a loop who\nA Knicks Knicks best friend organized to a concert and they created a scholarship in Nick's name they called it ... [laughter] and they are invited me down to come perform at concerts and so I went down to west Chester Pennsylvania\nAnd I I stayed in a guest room at leaks house where he told me that Nick would have spent much time and um [noise]\nAnd then we did this concert and I got to meet Michael we went for a coffee together in the afternoon and then I I played this concert and uh I stood on stage and in my view or nix friends and family and teachers and Michael and um [noise]\nAnd I got to play the song and um I my whole body shaking just thinking about that moment in and how touched I felt to be able to do that in and contribute in that way and then several years in a row I went down and and did that and\nAnd then Michael and I were also invited to give a symposium on forgiveness at a at a college in Philadelphia in two thousand twelve and we've got to spend even more time together then I remember going for a long walk together in a park and just just so enjoying our time together\nDifference isn't there I mean you would be closer to nix age\nAh yeah yeah I'm In my mid thirties so um I I guess about things neck would rounds that right Michael Vick with the forty okay so pretty close to five years younger yeah\nSticking the singer songwriter Peter ... who wrote a song called forgiveness and inspired by an interview on as it happens with Michael Byrd\nOr a man who was on the line from Norfolk, Virginia is someone who forgave his son's killer in Iraq and uh I I I think we need to hear this song I think that this might be so I'm I'm going to ask you to play it for us yeah absolutely", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "09"}
