with recipes we talk about pickle bologna and what most people get wrong about Appalachian mythology of Appalachia\nAnd that we're is monoculture hum the current generation of it is is that we're all scotch Irish and we're all irritated [laughter] um [laughter] and we are irritated but mostly because everybody thinks raw scotch Irish [noise]\nBefore my interview with one day I checked with mark Polanski well known for his books which is hard and soft now in his latest book curling up he tells the story of milk [noise]\nHow are you I'm great how are you ah well I'm thrilled to talk to you um I read cod was my first ... book a long time ago on your latest book milk I also found to be at least as interesting as caught [noise]\nInning I guess the ... people believe that the world started with a huge drop of milk\n[noise] yeah I mean a lot of cultures have creation myths that involved ... and I guess it's not surprising because milk is associated with child birth so it's a beginning of life\nWell but but some of the examples were great that the north legend the huge frost ogre sustained by cow made from falling frost vicious new turned to see of milk to create the universe it it\nWas more don't don't try this at home [laughter]\nI can hear in a glass of milk I guess it's going to military um the thing you say is interesting is that what forty percent of Chinese today drink milk\nYeah which is interesting because that's actually the world average about forty percent of people in the world drink milk about sixty percent of the people in the world are lactose intolerant\nBut but the theory was and you explain that you need lactase to digest lactose and milk and the theory was the Europeans do not have the gene the cuts off the production of lactase when you get older\nWell everybody is supposed to everybody when they get to about two years old this enzyme like face is supposed to ah stop working and then lactose becomes into just to build some people\nAnd that tends to be a Europeans middle Easterners subcontinent have a genetic mutation where this doesn't happen and that's why they can drink milk it's interesting that this mutation that we have is presented as normal\nAnd the normal people are presented as having an illness [laughter] that's true actually lactose intolerance is is what's supposed to be friends\nUm you said it was just a

this is Terri Hi how are you I'm fine how can we help you [noise] well\nI remember hearing on your show I as fairy simple recipes for eight grade\nOr something to cut a steak when you're really

eight and vegetables or anything like that\nYeah you can um it's available on almost any supermarket now my moon a which is the brand we so we think is the best but how do you spell that am Y. M. O. U. and posture fee\nAnd that's great but for grilling you're probably does matter I Would just brush it on either in the last thirty seconds of grilling straight up straight up or as soon as it comes off the grill you don't want it on very long 'cause it'll burn\nThe other thing I Do with pomegranate ... is that a small amount to finish ... her dressing it's as you know as sweet and sour and I just add tremendous steps to that so those are two of the things I Do with it and just as an ingredient sometimes I'll put a little at a stew just to add a little bit of deaths sort of a secret ingredient\nBy any kind of meats do I find meat and pomegranate ... go well together any beef stew parks do lamb stew at the end you can put in a tablespoon of ... just to add a little depth to it and nobody will know what it is but it just adds flavored\nYou're adding a little bit of sweet and sour yeah\nI find is probably one of the most useful pantry staples I have if you want to make a tip of some kind or he goes well in Greek yogurt you can add a little bit to that along with some fresh herbs or other things other spices but I Would take lazy and vinegar threats and adding to students are three things I Do Sarah\nI have all of that sounds good to me I mean for people who don't know what pomegranate molasses is like it's a little bit like ... what I might do for a glazes combine it with a little bit of butter and some Dijon mustard and they'll just put it on in the end so maybe a little bit of garlic now you're French or fight it\nBut I Do [laughter]\nOn yeah Mm\nListening to the

search of the region's history recipes and traditions ... book ... recounts her journey exploring everything from Chile buns to a dozen different types of local beans\nRonnie how are you I'm well Chris how're you I'm good I'm ... let's talk about Appalachia what is it an amalgam of a million different kinds of things if he were to describe it is there a way to describe it to make sense or is just too diverse\nUm the way to describe it makes sense says to accept that it's complicated and a moving target and what um and in that you can shape parameters around it but those parameters some time shift also on the territory that I looked at\nFor genuine and it goes down into the northern edge of South Carolina I'm In the mountains of north Georgia and an Alabama and of course uh Kentucky and Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina\nAnd if I left anybody out please don't hurt me [laughter] um and so so even the geographic definition a can stretch and come together\nYou drove a van right is that right you're driving\nI have a van if a Chevy astro\nOur guy [laughter] so how many miles how long you set out to do this trip is this a pilgrimage uh what were you looking for and how long were you doing\n[noise] honestly I'm not sure what the ... which is at one point I said four thousand miles and then I started looking back at my records and it's really a lot more than that so it was quite it was it was very literally and journey subtitle is an Appalachian Journey with recipes\nAnd that was important to me because a lot of what is written and has been written about um the people in the culture and the food ways of Appalachia\nWell a lot of comments from one person's perspective and their family but there are other experiences in Appalachia and I wanted this book to reflect those as well we hear the mythology of Appalachia is that we're this monoculture um\nThe current iteration of this is that we're all scotch Irish and we're all irritated um [laughter] and we are irritated but mostly because everybody thinks route scotch Irish [laughter] um so they're they're actually the last census\nAre more people in southern Appalachia who identify as Latino are African American there are who identify as being predominantly scotch Irish\nAnd part of my\nPoint I Am my interest is that if you look at the food ways you can start to pick apart the complexity and see all the strands of it and see how it comes together and it will challenge um some of the assumptions that we've made many of the assumptions that we've made about on the Appalachian\nA perfect poised to talk about food so you uh you say chili bugs carried out from the Dixie pool wrapped ugly in red Greece licked wax paper were my favorite show now now now defend that so so these were really good ... or what oh\nAnd he let me explain a chili plant is not a chili dog that's the first thing to understand there's no hot dog in it it is a very fine grained spicy\nChili mixture hamburger mix here that is packed\nInto a hotdog bond with onion and with mustard and the texture is extremely important and it's not like a sloppy Joe if it's not kind of slurping around and it's and they're being I'm from and the best way to think about this this this this is a dish\nThat was to my knowledge born in the pool halls and what you want to think about is if you're in that pool hall and you know the other guys running the table and you need something to eat you don't want something what Chile on your hands right yeah you don't want to get something hot and and that and\nThat but a little bit of Greece won't hurt you know might make your slide a little better off\nSo let's talk about some more food you know this really through\nThe ... sweet and savory banana pudding it had powder jolt of the custard okay I can forgive you that what has red meat pace reading ... no no wait a minute now that's that's a that's a milk stricter but you're from red meat so into a savory banana pudding what's going on\nAnd well we are being first of all true to the Appalachian palate one of my mother's favorite terms\nThat was Ronnie ... her book is called but Olson Appalachian Journey with Russ [noise]\nYou know growing up in Vermont the locals had a keen sense of place one family name their street to the road and the next week neighbors across the way to put up a sign Skidmore model for

names of Appalachian beans today things are named by marketing directors in Appalachia name\nSell real stories about real people in a room [noise] and so lucky people\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen milk street to chat with editorial director James Hirsch about this week's recipe pesto general\nJ. Mario I'm doing great today it's pesto day it is a and many of us and the food world it made it Eighteen different ways over time\nBut it never is anything like what you get in Italy and I always thought that was ... was better than ours but you went to Italy to figure this out the general and I guess it turns out it's not just the ingredients it's how you make it is it is and\nKnow one of the the most important lessons as always was that we do everything wrong first of all our ratios ingredients are way off in general walk garlic is almost an afterthought in pesto in the United states it tends to be very dominant flavor but it's really supposed to be more like salt and just heightened the other flavors we don't use ...\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nOr more luxurious sauce we think we have to finish beforehand that doesn't work\nI also learned that we get the order wrong and the order in which you add ingredients to either ... or ... or in our case into a food processor really matters because if you put the nasal for example into soon you're going to over process that are over ... and that's going to give you the wrong finished consistent\nSo your goal here is to get a pest that's pretty dry it's not a green sauce right it's dry\nExactly it's actually spread about whether it's before it's been married to pasta and we think of it\nAs a soft before to touch with the pasta but really if it's a loose then you've added to my olive oil and in general pessimism custard done I feel it's an added to pasta with some of the pasta water then it's considered pets and then it's considered a complete but that's why I say we add way too much olive oil are we supposed to be thinner and his earlier steak so\nWhat's the order of the ingredients okay the order is very important again 'cause you don't want to over process the ingredients you start out with the garlic signed up for the salt and you're going to reduce that too and I find tasty usually distributed through the ...\nThen we had our cheese if you want them finally ground add those and and again you add those to the pine up from the garlic you make a nice smooth consistency with a little bit of granular already from the cheeks\nNow the baseball goes it but when things we learned is that we couldn't just dumped the baseball in like they do in Italy\nReason is they use smaller more tender base and they're able to just posted a few times and it's done our case most of the day is what we find at the grocery store tends to be kind of bigger and a little bit heartier and we had trouble getting it to the right consistency without over processing it and try to get into a watery ...\nBut the solution actually was pretty simple we just chop it up by hand on the cutting board and then added to the food processor give it a couple of pulses and we're done\nI Would assume anyone in general what we use food processors just as probably persona non grata so is this is good as what you had in general\nWell get lax the romance of bashing it with a mortar in Pashto but I Would say we're Ninety five percent of way there we modified it enough with the word that we're getting really close and I got to say it is delicious\nSo Jim ... converted to the food processor Ninety five percent is good at least as the real thing thanks Jim thank you\nYou can get this recipe for pesto I'll say one seven seven milk streak\nI'm ...

welcome to milk street who's calling\nThis is like an hour Seattle high again how can we help you today [noise]\nI have a question about no doubt that size of the can and should be cooking it in in terms of surface area so I Want the rice like do I want to be a single layer of rights and or did you I Want it to be stopped at all\nWell interesting you should ask this question because for years I always cooked it in a soft pan you know which would straight sides in order to act like you said but um I had a wonderful young woman work on my last cookbook home cooking one on one and I asked her to contribute a recipe and she spent her junior year in Italy\nAnd she'd learned to make ... so she did a very unique Rizzo do but she cooked it in a large scale it\nAnd she said that's what they did\nChris well our editor Jane her she was just in Italy getting results of the lessons near belong or in Milan ... yeah and they cook it in about ten minutes to cook it very fast ten or Fifteen minutes they don't do the long slow sang\nPlenty of starch comes out of the two credit creamy sauce and so the whole notion of his thirty minute low and slow it was just complete nonsense that's not how they cook what kind of ... it's a wider paying like a scale it yeah yeah that's fine\nBut this whole low and slow doesn't really that's fascinating matter stirring all the time they started off stirring and then they just let it cook stir occasionally so you don't have to stir constantly either\nLet me guess is this recipe going to be in the magazine\nCourteous oh dear I didn't look at my last fall era you know I mean I'm In trouble so we've been reading blown up into you know I may do that that's OK so which is you is it in September October yeah okay\nI Would say a larger surface

good my question is about ... feet my friend recently had her baby and then when she went that Dr ... she was allergic to sesame seed now all of a sudden [noise] let me let me can come together we also like cooking a lot of\nAsian dishes that sesame oil so we're trying to figure out okay what do we now have to replace the ... and and I miss it also for the sesame oil\nIs she ... to nuts or just sesame\nTo the actual sesame seed\n... you know an almond butter would be okay for example\nOn butter I think would be okay the hummus I think was a little bit easier question we also heard that if you ... potentially that could help with this flute and it's I don't know if you've ever heard of that\nIt's also a flavor issue though I think a little bit right yeah like a lot yeah [noise] you know um I agree I think I'm In butter would be great for some other no butter yeah as for the component in Asian cooking you could try toasted pumpkin seeds oil\nOh it okay it's a wonderful ingredient and it's dark and it's just you and me and I think that would work it's going to do is very strong now so but you know be light toasted sesame seed will be careful with it because it can take over okay but it I think that would be wonderful and it's more readily available than it used to be it's one of those ingredients that people are discovering\nToasted pumpkin and see how Iran yeah well thank
