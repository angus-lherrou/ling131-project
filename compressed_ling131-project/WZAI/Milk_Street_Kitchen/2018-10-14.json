about how one consumer crusader that's Desmond used a peanut butter controversy to change our food regulation [noise]\nA lot of what the FDA does now and what it was doing back in the time of these peanut butter wars with trying to figure out how many peanuts should there be an peanut butter and should it be a hundred percent peanuts or if not then where should the line be drawn and and that quickly becomes an existential question even if you think it's a really simple question at the beginning\n\nBefore we dive into peanut butter checking with reporter Shane sheeley visited the bus

dot com welcome to milk street who's calling my name is Ryan I live and Logan, Ohio Hi Ryan when does your question today\nWell my question is about ... and next to ... a week or some of our own field corn last year wow yeah it was a fun so we were trying to make off at home and we did not have I guess that's heckling Lyme\nSo we're trying to use what ashes and\nWe weren't really able to find a lot of good information so I was wondering if\nYou guys [noise] and answers\nI go to Amazon and get the rights of tough to get in to your door tomorrow that's what I Would do I've heard about what actually being used the question is what kind of ... I mean what do they do with it now yeah I Would go get the right stuff\nBut by the way I Do have a question I assume it's a very specific type of corn you're growing for this right it's a ... like the kinds of field corn I mean it is to say\nRight that was another thing that came up we grew and Italian variety\nI Can't remember the name of it off the top of my head but I did notice the colonel's look a little bit more like popcorn but\nIt's marketed as a Flint core and like something you know what you're doing or Poland or we've made cornbread with it things like that so that was another thought that I wondered if that would make it more difficult to make most of what the the colonel's we're a little bit smaller points here at about ...\nYou know you can buy muscles [laughter] me [laughter] I mean you you know let me just to understand this you're doing this because it's an idea of perfectly agree with you this is just the cool thing to want to try to do right\nRight yeah I think it was an episode of fear is that they're talking about corn tortillas and how the flavor was better if you made it at home fresh\nLike using mouth or in the store That's Dr\nNo I I don't think we were saying grow your own field corn boy by mixture pour it off get rid of the Hamas boil it for four hours I think we just saw an ad that if you made your own mixture at home instead of buying the pre made here's a thought\nThere is so wonderful are cheese no uh companies that make rats and ground court financing mills is a it's an ...\nI wouldn't be surprised if you called the ban some males\nAnd asked them what is the proportion that they wouldn't tell you and then call good call one of the companies and just order the mosque [laughter] and I think this is what they're doing and what did you watch that would be my best suggestion even though both of us were hippies back in the day we we weren't trying to get our own or with Brian [noise]\nMaking so much yeah great question

one of America's favorite foods peanut butter and the nineteenth\nTo be with untested additives roof does have been to Washington area homemaker decided to fight back and she changed the way food is regulated here in America reporter Krissy Clark produced a three part series on the peanut butter wars for marketplace and she's here today to tell us the story of the\nPeanut butter grandma Chrissy how are you I'm great thank you\nSo this all starts the late fifties people are manufactured peanut butter that's not all ...\nYeah often in significant amount not peanuts ah at one point in the Nineteen fifties right after just came out these rumors started popping up that ah\nThere were in certain batches of Jeff at least only Seventy five percent peanuts and then other suspicious ingredients making up the difference\nSo is it the ... percenters is a problem or the quote unquote suspicious ingredients wait what if the rest of ingredients were perfectly healthy wonderful things does it really matter\n[noise] well I think that is a\nBig question that a lot of folks were debating at the time the the ingredient in question that I think raised a lot of alarm bells was a ... there was actually in the ... the factory formula [laughter]\nAt the just plant it was up to twenty percent Crisco and peanut butter and for some consumers this was a shock um and some folks described it as it was a tantamount to having peanut flavored cold cream [laughter]\nJobs are really doesn't hydrogenated fish boil doesn't sound like a great concept so the consumer reaction was fairly substantial 'cause you just tell us about it and how that happened and why did that happen and and how upset where people\nYeah well it all kind of comes\nDown to this um one woman named Ruth Desmond who had started an organization a few years earlier in the fifties called the federation of homemakers here's ... daughter Janet swab or\nShe said that's terrible they want to make money industry by putting less and less peanuts and the peanut butter and a ... children that are eating these peanut butter sandwiches mostly in here it's just peanut flavored cream\nDesmond was a homemaker herself a very spirited very determined woman and so she got really interested in this issue she started reading up on a lot of the science just about food in general and food additives in general one\nAnd she was trying to figure out what had happened and wanted to be feeding him healthy food\nThis was a time in American history where food was really transforming that was after World War two and the two biggest industries coming out of World War two where the food industry and the chemical industry and they joined forces and so there was a lot of stuff that was showing up in our foods that\nEither people weren't aware that it was in there or if they didn't know they didn't know what it meant\nA and so one day when she was probably in the halls of the FDA she ran across this notice that mentioned that they were proposing a standardized definitions for peanut butter\nAnd uh when she discovered that ... ... what prompted this was that some peanut butter companies big peanut butter companies had put\nA lot of this hydrogenated vegetable oil into\nThe jars of peanut butter that she was buying she was shocked so she had a newsletter that she would circulate among homemakers and a flood of consumer comments started coming in to the FDA hundreds literally hundreds of letters here's Janet again\nHe said I Will tell everything I Will get all the facts and I will laugh it to everybody because everyone needs to be an informed so she called herself and alert and that's what she got and that's what was in her newsletter you know telling people all the hearings and what was going on and the bills in Congress\nHuman coriander and yellow mustard seeds and then to American client\nAnd that just gets cooked together for about thirty seconds till you can kind of smell those spaces\n[noise] no I Love about this is that here in America vegetables in games are kind of bland they were like the centerpiece all you have to do is look to India for example and then you have the spices and all of a sudden this is as good as eating steak I mean it has a tremendous amount of flavor\nThat's right it's got a lot of flavor it's a great vegetarian dish we add a little bit of tomato at the end I\nAdd those yellow split peas to the dish those are really thick and creamy you serve it over rice with a cucumber pickles and yogurt you can um as they do and visions restaurant they add a fried egg on the top to make it kind of a more complete meal but really this is so flavorful and feeling that you don't really need the\nFight is going to go on everything about five years so yellow

think you know recipes on various websites and I ran across a on a website I like a lot that sort of specializes in sort of healthy California style food that\nCause heart out and then when I looked at it it seems like it at our but not roasted and I couldn't quite figure out\nWhat the differences in terms of taste mostly I mean I read up and I it's I guess it all like they figure if it's a cow at ... kill the roasting process or something\nThat's right yeah Cal powders just cold pressed cocoa beans that are not roasted as opposed to Coco which is roasted beans that are turned to pattern of course the fattest remove swell\nI've looked it up actually once someone said you have to use more Dutch process cocoa than Cal powder ... powder maybe stronger tasting but I don't I've never tested it I Would try one to one but I Would think the ... who's going to be stronger flavor yeah I Would imagine that a good thing\nAnd I think I like family they owe and please get back to us we liked the follow up\nOkay well I Am a federal cap hotter and my Patrick makes up thing and that\nWe liked that let us know yeah I think I I get I\nWelcome to the street who do we have on the line and my friend and I think they're how ... how can we help you today\nI got some green coffee beans from a friend of mine and I tried roast 'cause that's where I needed to do with it really know what to do it either so I tried to ... in a pair for awhile\nAnd they kind of started letting off these real paper ... skin your thing yeah\nAnd it could go from green light because every color to burn it yeah\nThat's what I Do crafts you've done is now about ten years ago I went through this whole process because I Love coffee and er I bought a number of different roasters sort of the popcorn popper where the their air rated and they they go up in the air and swirl around\nI did the rotating drum roaster the more expensive one and here the problems first of all a lot of smoke so you have to do it underneath the hood of some ... New York city apartment secondly I found that every batch of beans had a different roasting time and temperature\nAnd said very complicated to get a roast right because otherwise some of the burn and some of them are green and he has this problem\nAnd then at the end of the day I discovered that when I make coffee it wasn't any better than actually was worse than beans I could just buy at the local louder may play for like a so I think the problem is you need a professional expensive roasting machine to get even roasting you have to get the timing just right\nTo get the roasting the flavor right\nYou know and the good thing about green beans is they hold you know they can keep them in the freezer or something for a long time\nI never had much luck these things are expensive and there's a huge amount of smoke given off so\nI really wanted to make this work but I just go to gave I finally well yeah I mean and also the quality of the green beans you're buying you know that's a different issue to laugh I think buying roasted not grounds beans and there's so many good suppliers out there right now but that's the easy way to go well\nLet's bring any kind of guy who likes to get involved in long projects\nI like to have fun with that kinda stuff I've only got a couple of pounds of these green beans I don't think it's worth it to go great\nEasy ... three or four hundred dollars and get around [laughter] and I gave up after a while and we found is second hand you know a popcorn popper you know to thrift store it might be worth it\nI Do find now versus ten years ago my local place there's like ten different kinds of beans and you can get really good teams and make great coffee and the other thing I find is I like lighter rose liked medium roast getting the roast just write with these things is also a little tricky tricky\nSo anyway kind of there you go to thank you so much okay Brendan thanks for calling nicer gone already took their this is mostly radio I'm your host\nChristopher ... please give us a ring the number is eight five five four to six Ninety four three eighty five five four to six Ninety four three or send us an email at questions of milk street\nRadio dot com welcome to St who's calling\nHi this is the hand Casey how can we help you today okay\nSo um you know I loved it in the kitchen love to cook my one weakness I think is with desert the one problem that I have lived there it happens to deal with the frosting and the ice skating the decoration presentation all of that\nI Try a lot of recipes at home for my own crossing and I think but they never seem to work for the icing I Try that out or sugar with milk and vanilla thing it always comes out ... ... and then I tried to cream cheese one in the mix are also doesn't work\nWhat happens to the cream cheese when\nIt never really become spread out like I always even though I keep\nIt room temperature I always feel like it's still come up and never has a great consistency and the taste is always just not there so how can I make really good frosting and I think that at home\nI agree with you that the pattern sugar ice skating pretty ... yeah I really ... you can add like orange juice to anything but I I don't orange that idea they never turn out now and I don't like him a chocolate processing always worst nicely because of the chocolate cools it sets up\nI'd like an Italian ... whispering which means you beat egg whites are and then you heat up sugar and get a sugar high sugar syrup\nLike at two thirty nine to forty the temperature doesn't actually matter that much and then you drizzle it on the egg whites as beating them in the mixer for about two or three minutes and that gets you a nice\nFluffy frosting middle hold nicely ... a day or so it's not that hard to do but you have another\nI was just going to say the ... which is sort of similar involves egg white friend out which just sugar water\nThe thing about the Italian see you added sugar served the egg whites there's also the Swiss where you heat up the sugar and egg whites and look at too about one sixty\nThose are a little tricky you want an easier recipe for frost thing I assume\nI mean that's what I Would prefer to start that way I kind of build up my confidence to start working with something a little bit more than\nI think the cream cheese frosting though that is going to give you a good texture and that's going to hold really well too\nAnd I wonder if maybe that's more technique issue with me and not maybe really knowing how to work with my next or\nDo you have a hand mixer or stand mixer stand mixer and what happened you said it was just the texture was to stiffer", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Milk Street Kitchen", "city": "Brewster", "day": "14"}
