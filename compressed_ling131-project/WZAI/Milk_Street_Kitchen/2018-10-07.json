and food writer maybe\nSheraton about what to look for in a restaurant what constitutes good food writing and she also speaks about her latest project ask me me and\nI'm sort of the doctor roofs of food people call in from from all over the country or other countries and\nAsk questions about food and sometimes life related like my mother in law doesn't like the way I you know so you see ... we're talking about much more food [noise]\nThe first journalist making McCarron talks about her article the midst of authenticity is killing Tex Mex Karen argues the Tex Mex is an authentic cuisine a cheap rip off of Mexican cooking\nBarbecue joints flourishing and demanding high prices [noise] mom and pop Tex Mex eateries are closing down [noise]\nLet's start with if possible a loose definition of when you say Tex Mex food ... what what are you actually talking about\nSo a loose definition of Tex Mex is it's\nCooking\nDeveloped in Texas um originally as often our ranch food in Texas act when Texas was not very urban\nBy people often of Mexican descent um or who are who knows you know who've been in\nTexas in our family settled in Texas before Texas was part of the u._s. um that'd be using the local ingredients and more kind of Mexican influenced cooking styles and dishes and food that\nIs Mexican but it's also Texan and it's really fundamentally a regional cuisine of Texas\nSo there are a few ingredients that really a defined Tex Mex ... versus let's say traditional Mexican cooking what what would be some of those ingredients\nSo interestingly one of those ingredients is human in San Antonio there's actually\nA small but significant population people who came from the Canary Islands and the thought is that there's so much human in Chile and therefore started moving forward a lot of Tex Mex\nCooking because of the influences that specific cuisine of the Canary Islands and the chili picking which is a native Chile to Texas is also very important ah beef a flour tortillas\nAnd you know more recently yellow cheese and like sometimes even Velveeta you know you want to make a great case saw at home like\nGet some Velveeta and get a can of row tell combine those two things got some chips and like you have a great party you know I I think you can make Craig Tex Mex with packaged foods\nWell a lot of people have written the Taco Bell et cetera had an adverse effect on Tex Mex because branded Tex Mex is being fast food or cheap food\nI think it's very much like an upside down cake\nDid you cook in a cast iron skillet\nAnd there yeah ... but you can also do input like peaches are ... are you learning about um butter and sugar and ... and you cook that down you add the batter to it but this is just the basic skills cake where you melt the butter added to the batter put it back in I think still a parks for a new book Braveheart\nHas a color recipes for these she's the bacon for serious each dot com yes and you can actually go to the receipts and she

reinvent the genre using disguises to get an honest meal also employing a smart literary style of writing today shares in his Ninety two years old and with no plans to retire she's currently a columnist of the Daily Beast and just launched a new special series with the sport full pod cast\nMe how are you I'm very well very well\nNo it was but uh in December Seventy five you became the food critic clear at times and uh the person who hired you was a woman who didn't think a woman should be the food critic for the times is that correct\nOr not quite the woman who wouldn't hire may was a woman of an ardent feminist and it took five more years for Joan ... men who was then the editor of the section to call me up and asked me to come in for an interview\nThe woman who wouldn't hire me did not hire may name was Charlotte Kurdish the woman who did hire me was Joan Whitman and of course hired by the editor of the paper Abe Rosenthal\nYou still remember both of those names [laughter] well ... fortunately for all of us you became a critic\nUh first of all it's a very artificial way of eating 'cause you go with the crowd everybody orders different foods you get to taste\nYou can't just enjoy one thing or two things you have to try to eat everything obviously has critic [laughter] is that something you eventually get used to and and get to like or is it always a burden that as you would prefer not to have to do that\nI never mind that I rather enjoyed it because I was really interested\nTo know what I Would find out and I think when you do it that way you kind of know how to separate flavors and your mind it was however something that I knew I had my husband and once in a while when we went out together he said do you think we could eat the same thing tonight and have a share experience\n[laughter] yeah well it sounds like me [laughter] so\nWe did but unless it was a restaurant like Chinese or in the end where people often do go was crowds uh\nWas never more than four people and usually just my husband and myself on the first try to see what's going to be worth reviewing before we filed a lot of people and expense into it\nI Know that other critics after you at the times got a lot of ... about dressing up in disguises but you with us I think the first one to really do that I Love this quote a as you said even before the Internet I was recognized a few times\nThey are very few things more embarrassing than to show up in a way glasses and have the owners say quote good evening Mr\n[laughter] exactly I Would say so [laughter] you didn't know what to just should I flip off they'll do it\nPlay it's ... I had glasses and wigs I didn't I didn't ... strange outfits though\nIt now let's talk about one of my favorite topics a crowd sourcing vox pop Eli et cetera you're pretty clear that today I think you quote we have a lot of voices that I think are not worth listening to particularly ones from consumers which really like Yelp and so on are\nSo right I I actually agree with you but maybe you could take on the burden of explaining why you think you're right\nWell first of all I don't know how qualified they are to have a trustworthy opinion but even more I have never seen and I'm willing to be wrong on this I have never seen any such service require proof that the person has been a good point\nI haven't gotten him in the past not for a long time just as on a mailing list for example many years ago\nThe question asked from the gas ... asking me to be a responder with all the things the frail and\nAnd I thought how do they know if I'd been there I've even ask Tim's the gap that and he said we have a way to which I say baloney because you could just a ... if it's a friend who owns the restaurant or a relative\nOr if you just want to sound often use you repeat that kind of rating from your local credit just to have a voice in there so I don't really care what those people say\nYeah that that's true I mean social media you see all sorts of strange comments and their access to the ground all over\nSo let's talk about casual dining I think you and I come out of the same place you walk into a restaurant and the first Fifteen or thirty seconds what are some of the things that the you'll notice I won't either good or bad\n\nI might notice the number of help on the floor I might notice if a lot of people at the table seem agitated and are moving around a lot I Would certainly notice how many tables are empty\nI might notice the overall age of the people\nI might notice if there are serving stations around the room I'll tell you a funny story about that there is a super Greek Dinah in Chicago known as Lou Mitchell's and it's right near the American till exchange in the stock exchange\nBecause the traders are working with people in Asia and so on\nAnd the food is just larger than life at the breakfast and I went one morning alone because I was writing about Chicago restaurants I went around eight thirty\nAnd I had to stand on line a little and as he does the owner or his manager gives out little boxes of I'm a\n... a candy what do they call it any way to to women\nStanding on the line and finally after about Fifteen minutes I became the head of the line and the manager came over to me\nAnd said where is your place and I said what place and he said you're a restaurant I said I don't have a restaurant what makes you think so he said the way your eyes were working the room\nHuh [laughter] I really didn't for [laughter] it's like an apple or in a casino like you look around and milk\nThat is what they gave out in the little boxes to any lady on the line and you know it was super food everybody who ordered breakfast Scott\nOf cooked prone and a slice of orange and a little cup of yogurt no matter what you would if I imagine it's still the same but it was wonderfully observant of this man to notice my eyes working the room mark\nI I'm ... you'd like Joel rubbish wrong or in his cooking when you talk about his famous potatoes with a pound of butter pounds of cooked puree potatoes but he had a great quote I'm a ...\nI made this recipe before but the problem with a recipe I think is that when you just put wind it would be in a pot it takes a lot of the flavor out of the meat the meat is hardly flavor was and the wind is enriching unconscious it's kind of just the city can kind of nasty actually\nSo I I don't know how they're used to doing Italy but it doesn't work now here so we bought this in the kitchen what do we do\nSo critically really took the wind out of the equation in fact we took all the liquid out of the equation\nAnd so we have really big pieces of beef they're two inch chunks of these really heavily seasoned with salt and especially pepper and we put that in a pot with some aromatic and no liquid here the only liquid that we're going to use to brace this late comes from the meat itself\nThere's no wind no water no bras nothing to kind of do the flavor so you end up with a really concentrated meat juice\nAnd you're not ... before you put it in just you cook the ... a little bit then put the meat in but you're not doing anything else to leave before because there\nNot what we found a really cool way to kind of get the flavor of such hang me without actually having to do the work which you know we live around here\nSo instead of cooking at the whole time covered we take the cover off after a couple of hours and let it cook for the last hour uncovered and that allowed us to get some browning underneath there that you would have gotten if ... at the beginning\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support WC I at Cape and islands dot org\nReally diluted not only the flavor of the sauce the kind of made the meat tastes a little weird as well so we waited until the very end at that so we take the me out of the pot strain off the juices we had the wine let that cook for a little while and then add those strange meat uses to that and really creates a really nice flavorful rich soccer so\nThis recipe the Tuscan beef and peppers do almost no prep work cook a little use tomato\nPaste or the beat in three hours of the up and take it out reduced to monitor that any are done\nIt's amazing and it tastes great it tastes so good when thank you You're welcome\nEven get this recipe for ... and

your calls\nWelcome to the street who's on the line high\nCalling from Houston, Texas nice how can we help you today\n[noise] first I'd like to say I'm a huge fan and I really appreciate all of that you and Chris expose this too and provide thank you I like to cook and I really um I read something new and I want to try you know these new global type recipes\nMy question for you is what some pantry staples that would bring in a more global fair that I could use regularly and my cooking\nBoy if I were going to have to pick and choose and you asked that still limited and that's hard it's like well you want to start with spice blends first and then move on us I mean I think\nThe spices the most people don't have the sitar\nWhich is based on while time but it's got lots of other stuff in it I think is the most versatile useful spice blend in the world outside sesame seeds and full Mac\nYeah ensue Mac would be another thing it's a Barry used to be used almost in place of lemon it's our but it's also lemony it's great on tomatoes you can use it on almost anything\n... seed not ground coriander is something most people do have around I think is also really useful I'm going to put in a bid for a pet ...\nSmoked pat pretty well ... that's really great also because for vegetarians you know when you can add bacon or smoked salmon or some sort of pork products you can ... to ... to give it a little bit of smoking and you can buy India they have these little pins which have smaller tens in them for spices ... plans or\nYou can buy one of those seldom saw it and you can keep in that ten sort of the old purpose spices the spice one so for example at breakfast I'll take the ten out and put some sitar and some pepper or something on it and you can dress up eggs you can dress up anything\nNext is pantry items I think teeny is literally a must yeah ... Cheney by the way goes gray with chocolate her risa yes absolutely mix it with Greek yogurt for ... for example\nOr as the sandwich spread me so it was a great soup base white me so for chicken or as an isolated the fish when you're young yet [noise]\nAnd then my last suggestion would be pomegranate molasses which you can find almost everywhere it's our and it's sweet you can use it and I use it in a salad dressings just a little bit any kind of dressing or you can drizzle it over meet after it's cooked or ice cream or ice cream anyone\nCan you see a pomegranate in the last I also want to throw in a vote for ... ... because they provide a smoking is Anna wonderful heat to other simple things if you buy whole human seed if you get a peppered writer putting coarse salt and then putting cumin seat\nSo instead of salt and pepper your rights solar in human yeah and that is just for a general purpose way to improve your cooking you really can't beat that\nAnd then the last thing is have really big crystal like sea Salter floor to sell or mold and salt\nJust to finish food or would that crunch and you get a lot of mileage off that that's a good start yeah okay that is a great start at one less thing if you want to be a little exotic bite or if a pepper you are FA you have to bite on line it's a soft damp pepper in sort of flakes\nAnd its chocolate pie and rich is not too hot you know it goes on a lot of dishes it's just a few little tricks like that can\nMake your cooking so much better so anyway that's her list [laughter] okay\nFinally Don ... actually what I was looking out for me to look at it like\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball if you have a cooking question are we just want us to help you resolve a ... argument please give us a call an eight five five four to six Ninety four three the number once again is eight five five four to six Ninety four three or email us questions at ... radio\nDot com walk in the mail street who's gone Hi my name is Kay thanks for taking my call today pleasure act we help you might get\nGrange recently right now in Egypt type thing I got it bad or how much it would cost ... which can be about a hundred and Seventy five dollars\nSo I'd like to know your Kenya and I've never done a strange but I generally prefer by professional that knowing that extra cost I Would encourage have that luxury if it were\nWhen we built out the milk street kitchens a couple of years ago for a variety of reasons we couldn't use all gas cook tops we had to use induction for many of them\nAnd I was not a fan of that but we did install induction it turns out induction\nWorks very well it heats up fast uh it's not any slower than gas I prefer dial you know and I like to see the gas but once you get used to the controls than it does a terrific job it's also safer because you're not going to bring themselves so I Know when ... Christmas you know an induction\nYes and the point is that it heats up the pan through magnetism through the metal\nIn the pan so that only the pan heat's not really the burner and it really hates it efficiently and you can get it high and get it low very quickly and here's the thing about induction you'll save money in the long run because it's the most energy efficient of all forms of heat and cooking 'cause the heat only goes into the pan\nGas is the least efficient cars that flames go out on the side the heat goes out on the side it's not contained and electric is better than gas but induction hands down the bat so you'll probably save money and otherwise it's just one thing I Would look out for us to controls", "show_name": "Milk Street Kitchen", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "07"}
