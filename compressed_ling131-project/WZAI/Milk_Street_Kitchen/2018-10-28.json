Florida your father grew up in the south your mother was from Guam ... tell us about one ton of forward or what what was the community like well\nI guess it was an interesting place I I I Would say it was lower class living it was not the best living situation but I feel like it gave me a lot of contrast to ask for a lot of great things\nWell you you're right that there was Jamaican Cuban Haitian food in culture so the food must have been really great\nYeah definitely there was a lot a lot of wonderful I mean like Jamaican beef patties you know cabbage and and peas and rice\nAnd then on my father's side you know like things that my grandmother and just really really hearty um delicious southern food you know a Mac and cheese um [noise] she made the delicious spaghetti that had I think she will catch up and which sounds strange now but it gave it to this nice sweet ass\nAnd so it was definitely I'm of a wide range of of flavor that I grew up around\nAnd you and you also write that you when you were fourteen you were overweight and are you became a vegan or as a result of you so you really changed your entire dog yeah when you were a teenager\nI did um I think a lot of it was me trying to find myself a lot of it with me trying to find my identity within all of that\nSo by becoming vegan that such you apart from your family your brothers and sisters who were so leading the traditional diet\nRight it was it was a stark contrast you know like I'm dinners are very meat centered and you know starch heavy because a lot of it too you know we're trying to feed a large family on a on a small budget so\nThis whole concept of cooking from scratch was born because I have to be creative I had to think of a new way to create this food that I Love and I want it to taste but that fit my diet\nBut another thing you write about is negligence in the kitchen that is waste could you explain that\nI Would guess that it may be the age of the animal\nBecause if it's a younger animal it's probably going to be more tender and if it's an older animal shelter that is not going to work 'cause you need to cook that low and slow like in this too\nSo you need the equivalent of a loin cut very expensive I mean we have to be a line cut for quick cooking ... you can't use like and you can you shoulder right okay well you like it just would be chillier can be chewing\n... which is what I've been doing yeah jak because it's an easy\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nI'm tossing it with all those other things and then you know panic try aren't just ... ... ... it gets a nice you know I bet you the salt would make a difference\nOkay yeah well I I Would ask them just ask them about ... what kind of this and the way they get their land with him\nIn the um search for this I did buy like a leg that uh hello butcher sawed off of lamb for me how but ah that that didn't really help a and that was a young land but I was young enough that it was um\nYou know hard to work around the leg getting off of it so yeah like tricky\nI mean I the salty for two hours on Iraq is\nA good idea [laughter] yeah yeah yeah very good shot like thinks China but\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball if you want to know what to do with shrimp heads or tails please give us a ring anytime a five five four to six Ninety four three one more time eight five five four to six Ninety four three you can also email us questions at milk street radio\nDot com welcome to milk street who's gone this is natural Hi Nick how can we help you\nWell I've spent years failing\nTo recreate the dishes India generally due to lack of the authenticity gradients in\nGlee I'm having issues with the issues that are in their smaller slightly sweeter and of course anger that North American ... but they don't just color like right on humans do after long cooking and they're far less sweet than the daily as ...\nSo with I mean for ... like a ... or even something that's in the background like a butter chicken\nYou end up with a great career you if you attempt to let them ... or ... I\nMean ... if you'd go while I was or something like that or just something that's probably true sure every usually they're just too many onions in your hand or larger American yellow ...\nLet me ask a question ... yellow onions are sharp when they're raw but in our testing it milk street we find they actually turn sweet do you find is just the amount of onion or do you find the yellow onions are still two overpowering when cooked\n... you know what it's a bit of both but you just end up\nIn love onions all it\nI Know it's there is going to say so yeah he knows what I'm saying well how about challenge because you know they are sweeter than a yellow Anya and but not playing Lee sleep\nI you know we tried to Charlotte it's just not the same the flavor is a very different\nI mean if you're big complaint is volume I think just the yellow onion and just useless is the simplest thing\nI always think getting the spices right using whole spices toasting them and doing all the things you should do will make much difference than whether we're using yellow or to paint on your right I mean that's really the crux of it hopefully next to you agree with that assessment\nI Would agree with that and you know the sort of side bar here is also the total lack of a veil ability of genuine Kashkari chili which ends up being introduced many of those careers where you've got to give it a color and everyone tries to o'clock so that was a kind of the week up that's what you\nKnow yeah I have some sense you know one serious cook I Want to come to your house how\nWe do our own cereal smoking

furnace where my father was shoveling coal\nThat is almost Dickens quality [laughter] you know so you actually had a cold furnace and you'd get dressed right next to the cold for us on a cold winter morning [noise]\nWell I did because he had ... to ... to ... coming through the radiators and [laughter] and that's that happened every morning\nAnd my sister and I were sleeping Les ... in the attic part of the time [noise]\nUh if it's cold [laughter]\nUm my favorite story though which I Will repeat on radio since you wrote about it was it the Montessori school and you had a you had a child who who bit lot who was a biter\nAnd you could cause when you think with your sister when you bought her a you used to buy back and you actually ... him back and I don't know why I guess\nBorders and the ... school biting back a child has a biter just I don't know it just struck me somehow so ... ... exactly what happens\nIt happens very impulsively I\nWasn't used to being around really young children and I\nCertainly haven't been around any that were misbehaving and I didn't know what to do and I was about twenty six years old and I I had learned the Montessori mess it tonight try to [noise]\nTo interest him in ... you know the projects and and he just\nWouldn't stop and I just when he heard another child I just grabbed his arm I [noise]\nI didn't put him on hard [laughter]\nBut I have is a shame that I did that and um\nI thought that I was I was being let go from the school because of that incident\nBut in fact it was instead because I was wearing a rather risk cake last [laughter] see through blouse [laughter]\nAnd then you went on to other things so let's talk about your parents you said um there was a wonderful thing you wrote about your mother before she dies you said speaking to you you live the life I wanted to live so ... what does that mean\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen of milk street to chat with editorial director chain Hirsch about this week's recipe pasta controversial\nJay Maria I'm doing great it's pasta bean day here and no straight is us a call ... or has a lot of people say ... but look this recipes in hundreds of times I've done it many times you've done it but you went to Italy to see if there was something new or something that we don't know yeah\nYou know it is such a simple dish and I guess that's what attracted me to it because they're such simple ingredients but they have an amazing amount of flavor and in our max that they bring to the table and it didn't hurt that I learned it at this crazy why to read that used to be owned by the mafia\nApparently the government took it away from the mafia and gave it to a retired stolen art inspectors around in the meantime of course of course because it's the ...\nAnd as it turns out his personal chef was willing to teach me basic rustic civilian trucking and this was one of the dishes she taught\nThe minute I walked into her kitchen I was just blown away by the richer Rome is a federal and Rosemary and garlic and it turns out that what she had done is first and bloody beings into a pot that had been soaked overnight\nFor some while federal but she grabbed from the driveway of the winery\nA ton of Rosemary and garlic cook them away and\nWhen the deans were done to Austin some pasta started altogether and it was a racist\nTo have such an amazing flavor profile there were layers of richness and ... and yet there was no dairy and\nSo why is this different than the eighty nine versions we've all been through your\nI think the problem with most versions is that the focus is on the basics here the beings are kind of like a starchy counter punch to the rich federal the rich Rosemary and the garlic I mean those are really the dominant flavors that you're getting and they're married in this kind of like ... starchy liquid from the beans and from the pasta itself\nAnd so the result is really rich and creamy an aromatic and again for such a simple group of ingredients it just has an amazing impact in flight\nSo I assume when we got back here did you make any alterations so that we did we made a couple of first\nOf all we simplified it for weeknight ease we use can be and we were very happy with the results because in part the camping have that structure water you need to get the ... that we were looking for\nThe other thing we did was we found it was a little heavy and we weren't lighten it up a bit and I'd eaten the dishes second time ... and that time the woman making it added some tomatoes which we liked so we borrowed that to kind of bring a little bit of a city to it\nAnd finally we felt that a little bit of lemon juice and lemon zest also help tie everything together is right there and also really played well with the Rosemary\nSo political social and like I say I'm you know a basic recipe but now authentic and a much more interesting yeah and also not very difficult now very simple jammed thank you thank you you

we are experimenting with different ... for the doughnut and I'm having a problem with a lot of them crystallizing after I've played that do not some sort of getting rid of all and falling off and I was wondering if you had any tips on how to run but\nWhat is in your in glaze\nWell it usually starts with a Sarah based either like fruit puree with sugar or maple syrup or honey and then I'll whiskey in a confectionery sugar\nAnd I've recently started out in a ... such as butter or white chocolate or shortening and also a corn syrup products and that tends to help with the uh the ... but it's still sort of happened on some of them and I think it may have to do with reading them or like they dry out in the fridge I'm just not sure\nI was gonna say corn syrup that was my answers yeah ... I've got nothing left to say but what is your sugar is the corn syrup\nUsually five to ten percent of the powdered sugar staying with a shortening are fat I'm shooting for around five to ... and that seems to help but after heating and cooling maybe that's causing the criminalization or you know the other things I could think of is like the doughnuts being too hot or the ... when it goes on to the donut\nWhat do you do you take the doughnuts out and play some right away or you let them cool a little usually\nLet them cool like up to an hour or so before I get to that\nAs close to just warm as possible\nIn the industry when you research before you open the shop did they say to glaze the doughnuts that there are certain temperature to\nCool is what I've been reading and scenes from other industry folks I must say Reshef by trade so this is sort of new to me the whole construction side of things\nI Would think that if they cooled than you might have a more stable adherence between the ... and the donut 'cause if it's grueling ... steam coming off I don't know yeah I I Would try perfectly cool doughnuts and see if that helps\nYou know let me just read something else I'm you know when I glazed doughnut just at home you know in a simple glaze in powdered sugar melts and\nUsually I'd been advised to let them call very slightly and to put the plays a role here warm you know maybe try and very cold because you've got a heated glaze the glaze I Do is not heated more try him right when they you know like four minutes five minutes out of the oven\nHave you found that it depends on the humidity of the day or the temperature outside or is it ... absolutely so can I come to your shop and get a discount on the ones with the ...\nSo maybe maybe I'd guy well no maybe Sticky Fingers scout yeah moment Dickey finger maybe that's a I didn't turn it into marketing plus yeah that's not a bad idea [laughter] no I I Would try different temperatures and I would play with a percentage of corn syrup just double it\nAnd see if that makes a difference even done anything that hire you know I was just doubled and see if that solves the problem because that would be an easy fix absolutely\nAnd want a donut yeah Jay she did a good job they're hungry and good luck with accents\nI Love the show and it's it's great to talk to you guys and yet\nThey care about I welcome to milk straight who's on the line I this is this level it how can we help you [noise]\nAh so I guess about a year ago I read the\nUh Giuliani who wrote that seminal book on Indian cooking\nHer description of how to capitalize on ya and [noise] and it's different than the way I learned how to characterize onions which is to sweat the onion almost as soon as they get out of hand\nWith salt sunny doesn't mention that putting in Salt until like very act and ever since then I've tried it both ways and I have\nBasically not been able to the cameras on the incense\nMore I got sites I don't know oh dear I think we just cycling [laughter] there's a psychological problem is I'm not writing it yeah [laughter] ah Chris where you go I just\nDid it last night I ...
