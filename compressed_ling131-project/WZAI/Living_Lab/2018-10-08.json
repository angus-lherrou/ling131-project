Thomas professor of leadership and organizational change at the Kellogg School of management at Northwestern University His research has looked at how past knowledge and teamwork translate into future advances and how prestigious prize is affects the trajectory of science Brian welcome to the show\nThank you it's a pleasure to be here\nSo this year's winners in the natural sciences included two women that's made a lot of headlines I'm Donna Strickland is the third woman to win a Nobel Prize in physics the first woman in fifty two years and in chemistry Francis Arnold took half the prize and became the fifth woman to win a Nobel in chemistry do you see this as progress\nBut yes and no I mean it certainly making progress and very small steps up with it still has a long way to go\nI think there's a couple of different ways to think about it you know one is physics used to be a very male dominated field and as a consequence if you simply had more men in the field and women the probability of men winning was going to be higher\nAnd in recent years many more women have gone to physics but\nMaybe not long enough for all of their work to be appreciated because it takes a career\nOf research in order to win a Nobel Prize so I think what we should begin looking at is where is the progress as men and women begin to reach equal numbers in a field and then the expectation would be that they should be winning prizes and about equal numbers as well well\nWorth it are they good for science and worth working on or is this may be an idea we just need to get over I think\nPrizes or a great idea actually one because they fill that gap in terms of helping us understand what kind of work is really important citations had great you could quantify than anybody can look them up on Google Scholar\nBut prices draw attention to maybe the best of the best for papers that a kind of sleepers so\nIt turns out that you know Thirty years from now they really solve the giant problem and those are the kind of papers that prices draw attention to\nIt prizes can also spur on research in a particular area so what we observe than some of the research is that once a particular topic within a sealed\nWhen surprise you begin to see many more scientists moving into that price them would be expected if that sub silken never won a prize so it helps direct attention and coordinate resources an effort to potentially solve the problem when they'd be read too big it even take a break through\nIt and then you know of course I think presents a great because look they attract media attention so I think prizes play this very important role and so in some gaps in science and I think it's really another way in which science connects with you know society\nBryant would

Goldstone for at least two decades scientists have been working to understand what our world would be like if it were on average two degrees Celsius warmer than before the industrial revolution\nTo somewhat arbitrary number that two degrees but it came from analyses suggesting that it might be feasible target and that it might avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change\nAs the science evolved though two degrees of warming started to look increasingly dangerous and in twenty Fifteen un negotiators representing small island nations drove a push to adopt a new more ambitious target limiting warming to just one and a half degrees Celsius\nResearchers immediately scrambled to understand what that would look like and now the un climate change body is set to release a special report on the feasibility and impacts of one and a half degrees warming draft that report was leaked to certain media outlets this past week\nComplete with us negotiators comments calling into question the underlying science\nSo we thought we dig into some of that science Kate Marvel is an associate research scientist at Columbia University and NASA Goddard Institute for space studies she also writes regularly for Scientific American in her column hot planet Kate welcome to the show thank you so much for having me\nOne of your main research interest is something that climate scientists called climate sensitivity basically trying to get a handle on how hot a given amount of carbon dioxide emissions would make the planet water or current best estimates about where we're headed\nWell that's kind of a difficult thing because there are several sources of uncertainty right the number one biggest source of uncertainty is what we're going to do um but even if you remove us from the equation there still a little\nUncertainty and the physics up a system um and so we use this metric called climate sensitivity which is kind of an artificial metric\nWhich is what would the planet to if carbon dioxide in the atmosphere where abruptly doubled and it was allowed to sort of come into equilibrium over hundreds of years\nAnd our best estimates of that are anywhere between a degree and a half and four and a half degrees but the process of mess around three and ...\nOh absolutely not that one and a half degrees is actually um where the uh UN negotiators in twenty Fifteen in the Paris Agreement kind of set our target and that was\nA new target for a couple of decades we'd been looking at trying to limit warming to about two degrees Celsius\nAnd I'm a lot of research had been done on both what that would look like in terms of impacts and in terms of what it would take to stay within two degrees um how much do we know about this one and a half degree target I mean it's only been three years since that was kind of introduced as an idea we\nKnow a surprising amount about it um because we know a surprising amount about impacts and how they scale the temperature [noise]\nUm so although before this report we haven't done a lot of sort of directed research on what exactly what a degree and a half world would look like we had a lot of guesses um and those have kind of been borne out by a lot of the research that's actually been done\nWell let's talk about that were gases and how they've been borne out right because the crux of this matter comes down to uncertainty and a lot of people saying\nHey we don't really have a great handle on what one and a half degrees or two degrees of warming would actually mean in concrete terms for precipitation or wildfires or human health or ecosystem health are all these other possible impact so what are some of those impacts and how certain are we about them\nThat's such a good point about the uncertainty I I feel like people understandably want to know where where's where are we safe um whereas the boundary and\nThere is no hard and fast boundary and I'm a degree and a half world is dangerous climate change for a lot of people uh two degree world is even more dangerous climate change for a lot of people\nUm but the impacts of two degrees are in general worse than the impacts of of a degree and a half so for example um we are projecting more and more severe droughts at two degrees find out a degree and a half but we're still projecting an increase in the severity of droughts and the incidence of degree and a half\nUm we are projecting about seven percent more extreme rainfall events at two degrees and about five percent at a degree and a half\nThat sounds pretty incrementally less bad at one and a half degrees than two degrees I mean really how big a difference is is\nI mean it's it's a pretty big difference um and I wish I could categorize it as one is safe\nUm but I think really what we're looking at is scary and more scary\nWell that's okay that's scary [laughter] but how do we actually know that those are the likely impacts how do you get from a you know we're emitting so many tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to a seven percent increase in one particular impact\nUnfortunately um we don't have any observations of the future right now I'm at is it is [laughter]\nSo I'm sort of really good at that we we need to use 'em large computer models of the climate system to sort of project what the world's going to look like\nBut that's not all we have right we've already warmed a planet about a degree Celsius and so we know what the plan that looks like now as compared to what it used to look like before we put so much carbon dioxide an atmosphere\nSo the fact that we have a planet that's about a degree warmer and we have impacts that are already happening right now I'm gives us kind of an observation a way of of testing and value it and those computer models that we used to protect the future\nUm a lot of people think that a computer model is just kind of made up and and it's not um it kind of coats everything that we understand about how the climate system and how the world works um so a lot of these things you know are are just kind of basic physics um so for example\nWe know and it's it's just a very very basic thing that when air warms up it holds more water vapor\nSo for every degree centigrade you warm up the atmosphere it can hold about seven percent more water vapor and that means that when it rains it pours there's just more water that the atmosphere can dump on you and that's why we expect an increase in extreme rainfall now and and then the future\nSo that is recommended for a child that's less than nine months of nine years of age and older than six months if they've never received flu vaccine before then they should get two doses as their first time receiving flu vaccine\nNow what about flu mist that really true a lot of people I think seemed like a godsend when it came out that you could use a you know a nasal spray instead of actually having to be poked with a needle but then it was was pulled its its back ... what's going on with the message\nIs so of flu mist um yes it's back in it is a going to be available this a fall season\nSo the last couple of years Lewis has not been available in the United states when flu mist was change you of what we call the ... vaccine where that has four different strains that help protect against um additional strain of flu and the and the population\nThey noticed that it didn't perform as well or help protect as well as\nAs before and after rigorous studying of the vaccine these past few years the company has um as you heads\nIs a little change in one of the strains and um that was different from the strains that are circulating\nAnd so they've already done studies to look at how this new version of the flu mist is going to work and the data is promising and us and it shows effectiveness so that's why the FDA and a CIA pie have put it back on this fall to be available for people as an option\nOn presumably if it protects against for strains of flu and most of the other vaccines target three would that be preferable way to go\nWell many of the injectable said the ... flu shots are actually now available as quarter available for protection against for ... to ... so now\nOkay so that's good to know I mean this is obviously changing every season what the options are available and the flu vaccine changes every year it has to because the virus is evolving so quickly and and it's not always the same strain that's that's really causing a problem correct the ideal would be that we would have\nA vaccine like or chicken pox vaccine or any of the other vaccines that you know kids get prior to the age of five that last ten Fifteen Years or your whole lifetime\nIs something like that for flew on the horizon how far away are we from having a more permanent flu vaccine\nYeah and that's a that's a great question um there are many\nIntelligent scientists working on this very question for a few decades now of what we call a universal flu vaccine where there can be a part of the flu virus\nThat we can find to put into a vaccine that stays what we call concerned that doesn't change from season to season and we can give lifelong protection or maybe just protection\nFor a certain number of years and with a booster like we do with tetanus\nMany people are working on it and there have been some vaccines that had been in clinical trials and tested but we are not there yet but that would be what our gold standard for flu vaccine\nIs the hard part really just finding some part of the flu virus that is shared among all of these different strains are are there additional obstacles along the way\nThe hard part is finding the conserve protein that shared and that our body produces antibodies or protection against that part that protects us\nSo there are parts that are shared but our body\n... that seems like a a a real bummer of evolution [laughter] yes [laughter]\nSo viruses and and organisms have lots of ... and parts than that our body may see but not necessarily is to help protect us from them\nWell in the meantime I guess uh the annual flu shot is the best that we've got a she told ... is assistant professor of medicine infectious disease at
