[noise]\nThis is living lab radio I'm Heather Goldstone on the heels of the un climate report released last weekend hurricane Michael rekindled the conversation about hurricanes and climate change transforming in two days from a tropical storm to the strongest hurricane to hit Florida since Eighteen fifty one\nNow there's no question that such rapid intensification is fed by warmer ocean temperatures\nAnd that the ocean is warmer now and will continue to get warmer as a result of our greenhouse gas emissions but there is some debate about when and how to discuss those connections is it inappropriate to explore the root causes of an extreme weather event in the midst of an emergency\nA new poll of those hit hardest by Hurricane Florence suggests the answer is no forty four percent of North Carolina residents surveyed after Florence had said they think the time to talk about climate change is as an extreme weather event is unfolding\nIt's not a majority but the number who said we should wait until a week or more after it was in the single digits ed ... back as a university professor at George Mason university Center for climate change communication and one of the lead researchers on that poll ed welcome to the show\nLike your way to strike while the iron is hot a Hurricane Florence hits and by the end of September you're already out there running a poll of North Carolina residents I was was this by phone do you have any idea of the circumstances of the people you were talking to in this poll\nIt was not by phone and we cook the survey on the Web so we have some people in an email essentially and the note cancer question we really don't know ... you know to what degree people we're still dealing with with flooding or water in their own system but\nUm we were delighted that so many people were interested in responding to our surveys so shortly after they had experiences trauma\nAnd how many residents did you actually survey\nSo I Believe this particular poll was like seven hundred and thirty four\nSo most of those who\nIs for me as a member of the media thought the media um had done a good job covering Florence that's not something we always hear\n'em but the number who thought that climate change played a role in how damaging the storm was\nAh was much lower the number who thought that climate change was affecting them personally was much lower and we often think of these extreme weather events as creating a boost in a people connecting the dots between climate change and extreme weather and how personal the impacts might be so what do you read into that result\nThe thing about extreme weather events is that they hurt people but they don't necessarily teach people so you get a Florence in your community and it's terribly function but you don't necessarily have any way of connecting the dots to that experience and what if anything you know about global climate change\nSo if it really is a human function to do that teaching because the the storms itself for the extreme weather events themselves don't do it for you\nUm we know that the Americans the majority of Americans do understand our climate is changing\nUm most of them the climate changes just in front of them however they see it as happening somewhere someplace else maybe not even at our country [noise] um at some point in the future certainly not now and I'm mostly harming plans banquets in polar bears love people\nSo extreme weather events do actually create an opportunity to teach Americans people in North Carolina in this instance about the connection between something that just happened to them or something that is currently happening to them or to other members of their\nUh their community and um and to provide the context as to\nYou know why is this happening and is this happening is is more likely to be happening as a result of a you know this this abstract thing we called global climate change\nWell anytime you're trying to teach or or inform people it's good to understand\nWhere they're starting from and North Carolina I'm\nYou know I think in in not for those of us not living in North Carolina has a bit of a reputation as maybe not being that welcoming to climate science you know we heard stories I'm In the past few years about attempts to pass laws that would restrict how climate change can be talked about are considered in\nUm you know state regulatory and legislative processes give us a more fact based picture what did these residents of North Carolina\nActually tell you um they thought and knew about\nAre worried about climate change a majority believe that uh you know this is a phase the storm was affected by climate change was made worse by climate change in other words more rain fell as a result um but North Carolina is pretty much like any other state in in the nation in the sense that we've got\nPeople who hold diverse opinions and uh you know much of that diversity is regrettable if it's determined to based on people's partisan status so Democrats tend to see it in one way and Republicans tend to see it in another way the fact that the north Carolina skews a little bit to the red side of the the\nThe aisle um does tend to suggest that most north Carolinians are less likely than ah than the average American to accept the ... the reality of human caused climate change\nBut it did it in even in North Carolina that is not a majority view\nCase so it's it's really important to understand that um that most north Carolinians in fact do understand that that human caused climate change is happening\nI'm Talking with ed ... back of George Mason university a is that climate change communication researcher\nAnd let's talk about that issue of climate change communication how best to talk about the connections and this opportunity to teach or learn through extreme weather about climate change one of the questions\nHas been when is the best time to do that and just a few weeks ago as Hurricane Florence was about to hit 'em we spoke with someone from capital weather gang from the Washington Post's out whether blog and they said yeah well you know\nWe've touched on the climate change connection but that won't really be part of our aftermath\nAnd and redux after the emergency is over and I think that's been a kind of common view um but in fact when you ask people when is the best time to highlight these connections they said during the event I mean ... they didn't think that was an inappropriate time to talk about this at all\nTo thrive and and we have to also differentiate the fact that\nAn event like this is truly a an emergency and a tragedy for the people who are in the middle of it\nFor the rest of it for the rest of awesome that would be you know for the vast majority of Americans were incredibly interested in what is happening to her brothers and sisters in North Carolina at that moment or ... you know what now that the south Carolina now that Mike is rolling his way of of ah through South Carolina at the moment we're we're in\nThe media you're interested as well so when the right time to teach people about the context of why a particularly extreme event occurred\nIs absolutely when that event is occurring it might not be the best time to to speak to people in the middle of the events but the majority of us were interested we aren't in the middle of the events so I Would actually say that the the six out of ten north Carolinians who said that you have the media should be covering this connection\nI'm either during the event or shortly thereafter I I agree with them completely and the the fact that they so shortly after Florence that six out of ten of them said that yeah that's actually relevant information to us\nIn real time or shortly thereafter for\nMe that was the surprising part of our study we thought that people who have so recently suffered a shock as they did would would be unlikely to feel that way so the fact that they were pretty clear in saying the majority of them were clear and saying you know we we think this is relevant information and bring bring it on that that's an important fine\nI mean it was interesting looking you know gave people obviously a range from uh the best time to talk about it is as things are unfolding to\nA couple of days a week a month you know even later after the event or not at all and there weren't many people he said you know wait a week wait a month wait a little bit longer they either thought for the most part you should be talking about it as it's going on maybe you know in a couple of days afterward as well while people still have their attention\nOn that story um and otherwise the only you know really solid group of people were those who were just saying we should never discuss these connections at all it was kind of either one extreme or the other in terms of when people thought was the right time to talk about climate change and extreme weather\nAbsolutely so right now in Providence and the Atlantic large ... production team is meeting and Mickey ... aren't covered under the large we all category but the humpback whales and write whales that are experiencing\nAlso unusual mortality event are I'm being discussed and policy decisions are being discussed to see what I'm rulemaking might be most effective moving forward um\nTo evaluate different options about how we can\nMinimize our impact on these animals\nAnd what might those kinds of steps look like\nStill not sure yet I'm discussions have been going on all week so they may be different regulations\nOn fishing activity in certain areas or Satan cure type or um its use of different areas that we know that whales in Wales co occur with human activities\nSo in the past um different regulations have come out about the different types of lines or certain areas being closed for fishing when right wells are known to be\nWell come out of these next couple of months in the to production team meetings\nWhen you have an unusual mortality event like this um\nI mean in the case of the north Atlantic right whales it appears as you said to be interactions with humans Ghost Ship strikes and and entanglements things that we have a lot of control over whether or not they happen\nBut especially with a situation like the ... where we don't even know what the cause is is this something that you expect to\nEnd sometime in the next few months or in the next year is it something you expect to go on open ended Li do we have any idea I don't think we know yet I think um\nAs as we continue to learn more about what the specific causes of deaths are probably about ...\nOr take a better estimation is when it might be over if it is a disease related there's a chance that that'll Peter out on its own a but it just it is mostly caused by human interaction will need to look at how we can minimize those facts and be proactive and that\nI mean I guess a lot of times and the climate change conversation we hear the phrase a new normal is there a chance that this is just the new normal for large whales along the Atlantic coast\nI certainly hope not I'm I there are certain criteria that can be met to close down in a\nUh unusual mortality event and Weaver keep working towards that so whatever we can do to make sure that this this and we'll see what we can do\n...

circling Saturn sending back data and stunning images of the planet and its moons\nBut it was the last few months of the mission that really captured the public attention Cassini looped between Saturn and its rings nearly two dozen times before punching to a fiery and in Saturn's atmosphere last September\nNow just over a year later scientists have published eleven different studies based on the data from Cassini so called grand finale joining me to explain what's been learned as Linda spilger she's the Cassini project scientist at the Jet Propulsion laboratory in Pasadena Linda welcome to living lab radio\nThank you Heather I'm happy to be here\nHow many years of your life have you dedicated to the Cassini mission at this point\nI've actually dedicated Thirty years to Cassini going all the way back to when the idea was just it was just a concept within NASA\nAnd I'd actually worked on the Voyager mission and then was transitioning to what ultimately became Cassini and if you think about it Thirty years is the amount of time it takes Saturn to circle the son of single time so I have worked on Cassini for one side or near\n[laughter] okay one side or near thirty or here's\nWhy what makes Cassini so special and worth Thirty Years' war is central your whole career\nWell as I said I started out on Voyager and Voyager flew by Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune and got some incredible data of the rings of Saturn\nAnd at that point I just really fell in love with trying to understand how planetary rings work and so and the opportunity came along to work on a mission like Cassini I thought oh great\nChance to really see those rings up close and understand what's going on\nI have to admit that pattern has always next year or so of course I'm In my favorite planet in the whole solar system because of ... it's just so beautiful and to think that that uh well we kind of didn't really understand them very well before now what have we learned from Cassini about the rings of Saturn\nWhile you're absolutely right Saturn has the I think the best rings and the solar system after Voyager we had this picture of the rings as groupings of particles floating around in space kind of imagine like little individual billiard balls running into each other occasionally and just creating this incredible structure\nAnd when Cassini arrived we found that these particles tend to like to stick together into long clumps of particles and sometimes they can grow big enough to create objects we've nicknamed propellers the propellers are like tiny ring moons trying to open up gaps in the rings\nWe actually discovered that the two of the gaps in Saturn's rings have moons that create\nBeautiful wave sculpted along the edges of the gaps and of course the outer moons create a whole host of waves called spiral density ways imagine like mini spiral galaxies spread throughout Saturn's rings tightly wrapped up so lots of incredible brand new science and\nOne of my favorites was adequate knocks we\nLooked at the rings with the sun and John and this is the time to see any three dimensional structures anything sticking up or above or below these rings which are only on average about ten feet thick and so we did see these long shadows she noticed along the edge of one of Saturn's rings the berating\nAlong pointing shadows pointing to the fact that there were larger body circling the rings and that edge of the building was kinda like\nCars on a freeway on creating lots of shadows and of course things are just very very beautiful and we got to see them from all different angles on the left side the unlucky side and lots of really incredible data from Cassini\nOne of the the things that came out of the Cassini mission and going between the rings in the atmosphere was learning more about something called ... that they're actually elements and and particles kind of falling from the rings what is in rain rain\nRain rain actually it's a series of very tiny ring particles or they can get an electric charge and once they have that choice\nOn Saturn's magnetic field lines and go directly into Saturn Haley color ring rain because in a sense these particles which are made mostly of water ice are watering Saturn and also what was unique in these final orbits\nA diving in between the rings and top of Saturn's atmosphere was to directly measured only ring rain but the composition of\nThe ring particles we knew there are a lot of water ice\nBut we also found incredibly things like some cuts in the ratings methane ammonia carbon monoxide and a lot of conflicts organic compounds so a big surprise and the only way to really find that out was to directly sample those particles\nOrganic compounds does that mean life is somewhere nearby\nOh no not necessarily these are just compounds that contain a lot of carbon and hydrogen uh all the way up to we saw lake so maybe up to six carbon molecules that certainly these are the things you find as the building blocks of life but uh certainly no no chance for any life are coming from Saturn's rings", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Living Lab", "city": "Brewster", "day": "15"}
