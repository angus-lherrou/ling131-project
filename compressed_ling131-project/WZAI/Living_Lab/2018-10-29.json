sex [noise]\nThis is living lab radio I'm Heather Goldstone\nAn international group of scientists and legal scholars are warning that a federal research program called insect allies could actually lead to biological weapons program is funded by the defense advanced research projects administration or DARPA\nWho claims at the end goal is to improve agriculture by creating bugs carrying viruses that could genetically modified crops in the field but critics worry that it could easily be weaponized\nGuy Reeves is a postdoctoral genetics researcher at the Max Planck Institute for evolutionary biology in Germany he's also lead author of a recent article in the journal science raising the alarm about this program guy welcome to the show\nAnd keep having what is it specifically that DARPA is is doing that concerns you can you just explain what this research project kind of involves\nWhile everyone's head of genetically modified crops [noise] but ah is presenting the idea that this technology is not um flexible\nOr rapid enough and he's\nProposing that rather than having genetic modification studying the lab and then um characterized and spend approved by regulators that genetic motivations of crops could be done on the fly in fields I'm assuming\nThat's not upon their it literally my flies right\nI Am English and we do love 'em [noise] um yes so the ... they're proposing is that [noise] ... viruses genetically engineered to give the capacity to edit another species genome in in fields\nAnd then they are released into the environment\nTo infect the target species which in this case is as a crop\nOn the means by which they are spread around the environment is that they ought to be loaded on insects [laughter] so [noise] um this is quite a radical change to the way we view genetic modification crops would be addressing modification of orange tree in the field [noise]\nMe just make sure I've got this right we've got flies or some other insects bees butterflies something that are carrying a virus and that virus has some gene in it that's maybe pest resistance or greater crop yield or or whatever it is and so these insects fly around\nWhy do you think that's necessary what kind of threat to our food supply do you envision that would require that kind of response\nSo modifies a head of overstating it we're actually working with viruses that provide transient protection to plant so it's a production that doesn't\nIt uh just provides the genetic material so that the plants can produce proteins that will protect them\nAnd the types of threats that we're interested in a range all the way from pathogens that may cause problems and several different commodities also insects and then we're also looking at some potential environmental challenges that we're going to have like drought\nBut with something like drought why not just breed or genetically engineer plants to be more drought resistant in the long term why try something like this that you know you're thinking about it as being kind of a quick turnaround transient thing you know why not a longer term solution\nWell when you think about the way that we would engineer that into crops to get past route you're essentially engineering the plants to grow slower produce fewer offspring Celeste seed so all these\nReally result in reduced to yield so the systems to put those on board one hundred percent of the time I actually have negative consequences on the plant so we'd like to do is recognize that these scenarios are occurring in the field and I'm responding to them appropriately\nBut again why not genetically engineer a switch that comes on when drought happens I mean to use a virus to to genetically modify things out in the wild is a a a pretty radical way to try to to go about this is not\nWell it's um you know something that we've been doing in crops for many years we're understand these modifications system's pretty well and it actually allows us or this particular system allows us to have a platform where if new challenges do show up in the field and we can respond to them quickly\nWell to that point I mean how realistic is that idea to think that you could encounter a new threat whether that's a I I don't know you know like you said maybe drought but a pesticide maybe a biological change a genetic change introduced by\n... you see on your website concern particularly about state or non state actors so a threat pops up and you want to respond quickly how realistic is it to think that you could genetically modified viruses to genetically modified plants in the time she would take you know in in the course of a few months of one growing season wouldn't that take years just to develop that response\nWrite so well that's a sure just as a as a reminder this is fundamental research so we're looking at you know developing the platform so the idea would be if we have the delivery platform with the insect and the a virus\nModified then we can recognize a threat that a is incurred and respond to it\nYou know as quickly as possible we're\nFocusing on trying to accomplish this within that growing season\nThere are two major concerns that guy reads and his colleagues have raised with regards to this project\nAnd one of them is the idea that once you put a these viruses out into the environment there's the possibility for them essentially to spread or chip to modify unintended plants or modify plants in unintended ways I mean these are viruses that could potentially involve in the environment ecosystem proliferation risk\nWhat are the DARPA funded researchers working on this project doing to limit that risk\nWell we um are looking at containment strategies and all steps of the process so there's containment strategy is being employed in\nThe viruses that are being modified and so you know we can go into some examples of that but some of the ideas are to remove the protein so the viruses are incapable of\nA producing code proteins so they won't be transmitted by insects\nIf they're not transmitted by insects then how do they actually infected plants that you\nUh yeah so the you know there's some a complicated details here that are hard cash or in a short period but um [noise]\nBasically the first generation of virus would have proteins supplied potentially by a host plant producing it or potentially by calling section with a virus that produces the folk protein\nBut as it goes into the target plants that loses that code protein and no longer is capable of being transmitted between plants we're also looking at strategies to limit the insects\nAnd so we have kill switches that we're putting in place when we put out the call for the program we didn't ask for a single kill switch within the insects\nAre actually asking are researchers to look for it or not less than three and what does that mean a kill switch 'em so similar to the work being done in mosquitoes where the insects would be a one potential solution would be the insects are being produced on a food source that's required for survival\nAnd when that food sources removed than the insects no longer survive\nAnd then we're also looking at a containment strategies and the plants so there's the possibility of having plant targets plants that we're trying to give therapy too\nThe gene are the genes for accepting the technology plants would no longer be capable of except in it so that that contains them\nSo only only certain genetically modified crops could be further modified by this and\nCorrect that's the one that that that is one of the strategies that the uh one of our research groups as looking I\nMean these strategies and and a guy Reeves in our conversation with us said yes the proliferation risk while significant is address all potentially the much larger concern is simply that in the process of developing all of these technologies\nYou develop also a knowledge base which others could\nReadily take in turn into biological weapons\nWhat are the DARPA funded researchers you know what is the insect allies program that that you're overseeing doing to address that risk\nWell the first time and you know like say the uh anytime you're doing really innovative revolutionary research like this there always are concerns with dual use capabilities\nMeaning that somebody else could use it for an unintended ... that's right so what are you actually doing to make sure that others don't use these technologies or the information about these technologies I'm In ways that could actually create threats to create biological weapons\nOr so we've communicated what we're doing throughout the U.S government we've had discussions with a State Department with uh the USDA\nAnd we've had conversations about how the technology is being developed and\nThe development of the technology and the research lab the ah oversight is being conducted by the U. S. D. A. first and so we're following all the protocols put forth by the USDA fest and also following the governmental rules has put forth by the international treaties\nDoes that really do enough to make sure that no one can get the information that would be needed or that would help them to create a biological weapon\nWell I think there's always a risk reward way that you have to look at this you know I think the benefits to agricultural production to meeting the challenges of the future [noise] making sure that we are a food secure a population\nAre really going to require some of these new tools\nIs there actually a credible threat I mean you talk about the rich reward here are others trying to develop\nWarren this kind of response do what evidence do we have that we really do need a technology that some see as incredibly risky\nWell I think there are examples right now are that are occurring where an approach like insect allies\nWould have given us a really fantastic tool that can help mitigate issues I think if you look at what's happening with the fall army worm currently in Africa introduced in April of two thousand Seventeen quickly spread to almost half the continent\nAnd these are the kinds of problems that we want to address and these problems can pop up very quickly and sometimes a unforeseen and so we want to develop a platform that we can be responsive to those needs and the future so that we\nCan minimize ah losses in our agricultural sector\nBlake ... is a program manager at the defense advanced research Projects Agency where he

we are on that we are restoring these waterways and salmon populations\nAbsolutely we have been restoring salmon ever since we first started noticing declines in salmon populations um it's certainly not a new thing um I mentioned earlier how\nSalmon were actually at their lowest point in the ... century and they have been recovering since then I'm In the\nNineties and two thousand we definitely saw numbers dropped again and they are now on the endangered species list but they're still here um we still have wild salmon in rivers in the northeast United states and a lot of that restoration work focuses on making sure that fish can get to the habitat they need\n'em they're not going to recover if they can't reach the really cool\nInstead had water strains that they need for spawning and

but as people started searching for information about Donald Strickland it became apparent that she didn't have a week a PDF page in fact a request to start one had been denied earlier this year\nThe media foundation says it is committed to a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge\nSo what does this incident say about the success of that endeavor and what is what you're doing to broaden its horizons joining me now is Katherine marsh she's executive director of the week of media foundation with a PD as parent organization Catherine welcome\nTo the show Oh thank you so much for having me I'm going to start with a giving you a chance to make ... case I mean you know my son's schools elementary and middle schools say we can ... is not a trustworthy reference that they can cite in their projects at school\nWhat's wrong with that why should we trust with the media\nWill we get the T actually starts from the suspicion that were work in progress and we want people to read it with a critical why\nWe think that we are an excellent place to start learning but if you're in the process of doing some deep learning likely you'd want to do on a school project we're probably not the place to stop learning we want you to use this as a jumping off point to go deeper into subjects check the citations and make a PD articles\nAnd you know truth be told and I was a kid I wasn't allowed to cite encyclopedias either be as an encyclopedia and the same rules apply\nSo what is in a look at the DEA and obviously not a comprehensive but give us some of an overview how big is it PTA at this point and how much of it grown or change since it started in two thousand one\nIs pretty big ah we're in about three hundred languages across all those language says there are about forty eight million articles which is bigger than any ah encyclopedia I've ever seen a huge\nIn English alone there about five and a half million articles\nUh so that doesn't quite fit on a shelf but uh you know it's not as comprehensive as we'd like to see and I think\nThat a ... the example of a article that Thomas Strickland is a good one while we have a tremendous amount of coverage that many many things in the world there's also a huge amount that's missing and I think that that actually speaks not just to a ... who are sort of shared human knowledge and and what we've prioritized over over the years\nStrickland have a page before she won the Nobel Prize\nYou know it's a combination of factors she deserved a page before she she won the Nobel Prize clearly she was notable within the scientific community she was a leader in the field a physics\nBut what we found in talking to that um editor who declined the page was you know he wasn't an expert in her field and you took a quick what keeps going through a backlog of about four thousand articles and needed review and he didn't see the citations that met the minimum ... here we have for academic inclusion\nNow we can talk about what it was a mistake or not a mistake and I think the editor who did that wrote a really nice essay about why he made that choice [noise] um but you know the simple answer is is that\nSometimes we get it wrong and um sometimes it's a variety of different factors and then this one we got it wrong and we wish that there was more coverage about a doctor Strickland accomplishments before she win the prize for\nWe will put a link to that essay by the editor on our website but I I Want to\nDrive a little bit further into maybe some of the context for this because whether or not this was a mistake it is a reflection of broader societal biases against women in science that she wasn't receiving all of that same attention and ... just kind of reflected that\nAnd I think that's an excuse that we hear from the tech sector for a lot of an inadvertent biased you know we're not creating a biased we're just reflecting the biases that already exist in society do you think that's good enough for what the media\nI don't think it's good enough but I Do think it's part of it absolutely um\nYou know we we believe in this principle that we call knowledge equity which is this idea that people should be able to participate in knowledge and that if we're really going to have the sum of all knowledge\nWe really kind of nice to have a diversity of folksy contributing a diversity of knowledge and breath of knowledge that's reflective of our whole society so we look at this and we go we really need to do better this is um you know in an instance in which are systemic internal bias these are\nOur reflect into the broader public a it's a moment of awareness for us to talk about\nHow we could PTO works and how we need to improve its moment for us to call on editors and people to contribute in fact the week after the news story broke it was one of the busiest weeks for contributions about women on Wikipedia since we've been tracking those statistics and so\nYou know we could be the is what we make of it it's written by people and it's an opportunity for us to again\nA highlight the fact that we we do need more contribute as we need more articles that women are we\nYears ago that in fact the number of biographies about women on the computer was only about fourteen percent of the total number of biographies and they're more than a million biographies on the computer\nNow fourteen percent of five rethought women does not reflect in any way the contribution of women in the world so the editing communities than working on correcting that gap\nAnd at this point in time about Seventy two new articles about women are written every single day now that's a pretty big number but overall the move the needle for that Eighteen percent so you know where it takes a lot of time and have\nThe very interested handcrafted articles I guess you could say that's a big mountain to climb\nIt is a big mountain and we know we have to do better because we know that we compete is really the front door for so many folks when they start learning about the world and what we don't see there is a form of bias\nCatherine mar as
