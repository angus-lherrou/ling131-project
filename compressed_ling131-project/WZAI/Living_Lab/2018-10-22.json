UCI\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nLab radio I'm Heather Goldstone the UN's most recent special report on climate science was eye opening for many but for the for a million or so people who live in the Arctic the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change our daily reality more than a shocking headlines\nThe Arctic is warming at least twice as fast as the rest of the globe weather and seasons that have provided the rhythm of life for just\nSing and exposing new expanses of ocean and previously frozen ground is falling and becoming unstable and the changes in the Arctic are wreaking havoc on the climate system in ways that affect all of us\nThese are the topic of the second season of the podcast threshold executive producer Amy Martin spend Eighteen months traveling around the Arctic reporting the stories of the people who live there and the scientist trying to understand Arctic change Amy welcome to the show thank you for having me\nSo in the first season of threshold you took on a distinctly a local maybe regional environmental issue and that's the American bias and what made you want to do something as remote as the Arctic for your second season\nThe Arctic is just fascinating to me personally it has been for a long time and um I think as I was you know learning more about climate change just as a as an interested citizen and as a journalist\nThe Arctic just keeps coming up and coming up and coming up and I kind of it was a little bit like the blind person trying to trying to describe the elephant where I just felt like I kept seeing\nYou know one piece over here in another peace over there and I just really wanted to try to stitch it together and understand\nUm the whole picture as best I could for my own curiosity and because I it because it's such an important area\nAnd then I also felt like I was noticing that most of the stories I was reading um you know focused on scientists and for for a very good reason and we we have a lot of scientists and the season the show as well\nBut it was really noticing a lack of input from people who live in the Arctic and so now that was kinda my second motivation was to really understand this area through the eyes of the people who live there\nSo you traveled to all eight countries in the Arctic helped me out here U.S Canada Russia there's another five [laughter] yeah\nUm let's see Iceland Norway Sweden Finland um who am I forgetting there was a candidate yet\n[laughter] oh Greenland Greenland Greenland force and for a million people live in the Arctic I mean that that was really surprising to me [noise] yeah\nYou know it's interesting um there's kind of a popular conception of the Arctic as a I mean the word that comes up over and over and literature is you know but there and waste land and um you know that that's not the reality there have been people living in the Arctic for a very very very long time and um\nYeah there's lots of vibrant cultures and you know interesting things happening up there\nIn shopping malls I'm ah in Russia I went to the largest city in the Arctic I'm more months can you know it's just it's a it's a big city three hundred thousand people and\nUm you know took the took the bus and did everything that you would do in a in a city you know below the Arctic Circle so there there's a lot of myth busting to do around the Arctic and that's part of the fun of the season as well\nSome of the people are as your kind of alluding to seem very relate a bull and in fact I was struck\nA you spoke with a kindergarten teacher Kate coke yuck I Believe is is how you say her last name ... ... I'm a resident of a shift from a rough Alaska\nAnd she was talking about how climate change has impacted her home and she sounded like she could be somebody who lives on Cape Cod or many other shorelines ... facing the threat of erosion and sea level rise let's let's hear from her every time I think\nAbout it I just want to tell people my house now would have been right where the seawall it had they not moved it yeah and if it wasn't for the seawall probably more would have been taken away and\nHad they not move the houses they probably would just fallen and so when you think about it like that then it's like oh my goodness\n[laughter] we don't necessarily think of a sea level rise and erosion being Arctic issues but clearly they must be\nYeah yeah and the big issue in ... Alaska is actually it's less about sea level rise and more about loss of sea ice because\nUm this tiny little barrier island in northwest Alaska or has has been protected in the winter from these you know raging Arctic storms that come down and kick up a huge you know\nOf wind and waves they've been protected by that historically because I'm the sea ice forms around them and it almost kind of provides like an insulation or a buffer and so the waves would break you know a mile or two away from the island\nBut now because the sea ice is forming so much later and it's dinner and weaker\nAnd it melts away sooner that means all of these storms are just slamming directly into this island and it's just eating away at the island at the same time it's a permit for us the frozen soil is dying and so that makes it so much more vulnerable\nUm you know to being washed away when those waves hit so it's a\nIt's a one two punch there and and the this island is is tiny and so um you know people in this case what keeps talking about\nThey actually had to like physically pick up her house and move it closer to the center of the island because it would have just been washed away\nAmy as that story points out clearly the changes relating to a climate disruption are happening in the Arctic right now as you were traveling around doing the reporting for this season of threshold what were some of the most dramatic changes that you saw well honestly\n... was was up there um you know to to visit a place where there are six hundred people who are just in in a sense having to like move closer and closer and closer together you know as the years passed as the as the waves come in it you can really feel um the change and\nUm you know that that was that was really intense um I also you know in northern Scandinavia Norway or nor in Sweden in particular is where I spent the most time in the the northern parts of those countries um\nThat everyone is talking about how just everything's different um they used to get these\nUm you know deep colds early in the season and have you know a lot of of I'm kind of sugary light sort of snow that comes when it's really cold well now they're getting a lot of rain and heavy wet kind of cement like snow\nAnd what that does is um you know there are there are a lot of um ... people who live in the far north as are indigenous the indigenous people of northern Scandinavia and western Russia\nAnd they heard reindeer and so ah the ranger actually can't get to the food that they need in the winter because these rains come and it makes this big kind of ice cover over the ground and reindeer aren't evolved to dig through I can dig through snow\nUm it does not ... you know the rate which is changing right now as has everything to do with us in our carbon emissions but my point is\nYou know the earth is going to be okay in the long run 'em but what's really up for grabs is human civilization and and the way that we get our food the way that we get our water the way where we live\nHow we are able to take care of ourselves and I'm sort of the peace and stability of our society's\nUm and I think that if people there's a way that this conversation I think often gets framed only in terms of very technical scientific concepts those concepts are very important and worth understanding but what the impact that they have on us has to do with you know\nWhether or not our children are going to be safe and healthy and I think if we can shift the conversation to those very reliable human questions it might help us wrap our heads around how important this isn't how crucial it is that we get real about what's going on and start using our meant human creativity to try to solve this problem\nAmy Martin of the podcast threshold she spent Eighteen months reporting on climate change in the Arctic and that is the subject of the second season of the threshold podcast airing right now any thanks for sharing your reporting with us thank you so much for having me\nNext the promise of treating addiction like any other chronic disease\nSongwriter Boris ...\nThese are the Cape and islands and I are stationed out\nSupport for double UCI comes from you and from the law firm of laying eggs so far is in Boulder providing families and businesses in the greater New Bedford community with legal services for forty years learn more about laying acts of bars and Bullard at el ... dot com\nAnd from Jill new bar architects and keep their members of the circle of ten ten local businesses and organizations whose funding help support the local programming you hear on WC on the circuit looked in\nTallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum isn't the political fight of his life he's running to be Florida's governor against former Republican representative Ron defenses polls show them in a dead end Gillum star power get him across the finish line will meet the mayor next time on one\nWe won a for you following living lab coming up at ten o'clock on W. CIA [noise]\n\nWelcome back to living lab radio I'm Heather Goldstone\nRural Americans now site the opioid addiction epidemic on par with jobs and the economy is the most pressing problems facing their communities that's according to an NPR poll released this past week and you know for a special brings viewers face to face with that reality\nAll states dominated by one of the hardest most dangerous jobs in the world\nMost of the old timers that work on them I work with and then buying pills community and people used\nTo work at the same people that\nIt just it ruined\nJason Edwards speaking ... new special called addiction that film explores the biology and chemistry of addiction as well as promising new discoveries and trends in treatment Sarah hold is writer producer and director\nDr Laura ... is medical director of the substance use disorder bridge clinic and an attending physician on the inpatient addiction consul team at Massachusetts General hospital she's also assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school welcome to both of you thank you for having me thank you\nSara in deciding to to do this special film these stories and this issue are very much on the minds of Americans across the country across you know all sorts of different spectrum why make a documentary about this issue now\nBecause I felt like I'd looked at so many documentaries on the subject and almost everyone in them was dying of an overdose they really focused on the tragedy they were very powerful they were making people aware of the crisis\nBut I haven't seen a documentary in quite a while that really tried to explain the science of addiction how does it bring change when it's chronically exposed to drugs why do scientists say it's a brain disorder and not a moral failing what can science tell us about what's the most effective treatment\nAnd I hope the film could help educate the public about addiction and really help them have compassion for people struggling with it and offer solutions\nSo what were some of the the things that you found in your reporting that were knew that that kind of advanced the story as you said in in perhaps a more optimistic or more hopeful direction\nPerhaps one of the most important things I realized is that when it when it comes to opioid addiction\nThey're incredibly effective medications now that can help patients deal with withdraw with cravings and yet the stigma against them is huge um I Would talk to like a Stanford graduate student who have been a medicated assisted treatment for four years\nHad finished his PHD was on the job market she'd be too afraid to give me an interview because even though he was successfully and recovery he felt like the people would hold it against him that he ... he was being treated for addiction\nDid you in your reporting gain any insight into where that stigma and where the controversy over medically assisted treatment comes from\nWell let me first of all I think one of the big reasons for stigma an addiction is it it's a baffling illness it's baffling force on patients end up engaging in very destructive behavior it's very hard for the people around them to understand so it kinda contributes to this idea that addiction is a moral failing which it isn't [noise]\nUm and then I think for years you know one of the only treatments available was the twelve steps\nAnd they really shunned the use of any drugs and the fact now that we have medications that are highly effective oftentimes will say that you just trading one drug for another and in fact that's not the definition of addiction addiction is\nCompulsively consuming a dry despite negative consequences and when people take drugs to help them you know\nTreat their addiction they're actually able to get up and go to work they're able to [noise] uh we engage with their families their communities hold down jobs go back to school they're no longer you know [noise]\nTen you know technically labeled as having the disease of addiction they're not engaging and destructive behavior and yet very few people can go to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and say I'm On medication assisted treatment\nSo there's a there's a stigma from from both ends Laura as medical director of energy ages bridge clinic how are you treating patients who come in with an addiction problem and wanting help\nSo at the bridge clinic our mission is really immediate access very low barrier care and welcoming people at any stage of their illness so kind of coming as they are\nAnd starting you know where the patient feels that they can start really meeting them where they are and then helping to move them along and [noise] you know when we talk about addiction treatment\nThis is thought to be a really innovative approach but I I'm an internist in primary care physician and when we look at um the treatment that we offer for every other chronic relapsing illness that we treat in medicine this is completely analogous to that so we're just looking at substance use disorders through the lens of other\nChronic illness management and the dirty little secret is that it works and it's critically important as Sarah said I'm\nJust start people immediately on life saving medications but also to getting back to a meeting people where they are if people say I don't I'm not ready to do medication right now I'm where I'm not ready to um you know see you regularly but I'm kind of\nTipping my toe into this I'm thinking about it um this illness is really underscored by ambivalence I'm as well as stigma and so working with people where they think they can start in sticking with them\nI'm understanding that that's not a quick exit off the highway but it's it's often a circuitous routes um and so sticking with people working to reduce the negative consequences of their ongoing drug use 'em and\nThat's human compassion and connection\nUm and understanding that this is an illness of deep isolation and shame because of stigma deep rooted stigma\nAnd we do a lot of working with people to try to undo that and reclaim the trust that the medical community has really lost with a lot of people with addiction because of our highly structured models that really don't meet the natural history of this illness\nYou know we've been talking about this controversy and and even the stigma attached to medically assisted treatment for addiction can you just walk us through\nThe evidence I mean you know as you said meeting people where they are and offering medication if that's what they want the the dirty little secret is it works what's the evidence in support of medical uses the treatment", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Living Lab", "city": "Brewster", "day": "22"}
