other direction this was not great news for the people have ... they'd always been told the Arctic Circle ran through the middle of their island\nWith when we moved from there so I'm sure this is true [noise]\nStephen ... realized they had a decision to me\nThey can ignore the science of how the Arctic Circle actually works and just make another stationary monument in the same old place or it could last this new information reshape their whole idea for the monument and as you've no doubt gassed they decided the complicated facts were much more interesting than the nice easy section\nSo so everything is changing\nSo openly things on the move so we had lots of different ways of representing this moment and then gradually it crystallized into something as simple as as for because it's something you can move around it also represents\nWhat we're wrong because everything that we're talking about or thinking about is actually affected by ...\nOkay so some kind of ball something that rules but also something that doesn't roll too much frenzy as a really windy place\nIt has to have a certain presence of certain physicality a certain way\nSo an enormous mall of concrete ... tons it's three meters in diameter or about nine feet\nSo it's it's bigger than us now there was the thing that we realize they have to be\nBig enough to be something that you couldn't put your arms rocked it's an even if five people like there are other it'd be it'd be having a struggle so it's it's something you you can't contain it has its own life does its own thing and we just have to follow and like now even though we notice going north this summer it will go south\nYep you heard that right it's even more complicated the Arctic Circle isn't only moving in one direction the moon has an effort to source team says that has the earth's axis ways back and forth about twenty thousand years in each direction there is a much smaller faster wobble\nIt's caused by the moon\nOn is should the roads between going to choose\nWhat it comes down to is this the movement of the Arctic Circle isn't a straight line it's a ... a big line moving in one direction with a bunch of smaller little ... and then just when I thought I really understood what was going on or seen said this\nWas our group is one ... comes in who's on people remember finger burger of Arthur's the movements of the U.S cross this is something we can't predict very accurately\nPieces of the earth's crust are also moving and that throws another wrench in the works I have to say as I was learning all this my heart kind of went out to Steve and Kristen and the competition organizers\nIt seemed like a simple challenge make a monument to the Arctic Circle on this tiny little line the human beings and drawn around the top of the earth\nBut the deeper these two went into it the more complex it became\nBut I think that's also something you said that does you get older you realize that you don't have across from everything the older you get the more you realize you don't do\nThis kind of thing happens to all of us this moment when we learn something new that makes everything so much harder and more complicated than we thought and then we have to decide if we're going to take that in our turn away\nThis happens a lot with climate change as we learn about how our own actions are impacting the climate for some of us it can get so overwhelming that will grab on to any alternative story anything that helps us just to turn away\nAnd one of those stories is actually related to this story it's a narrative that says the planet is heating up because of changes in ... and other natural processes\nNot our carbon pollution you may have heard this yourself and wondered could there be anything to that so let's take a quick look\nOf all the earth's climate does of course change naturally the planet has always fluctuated between ice ages and warmer periods and changes in ... are part of what drives that pattern\nBut those changes play out over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years\nThe warming we're experiencing now is happening at lightning speed in comparison we can measure it in decades and the cause of that warming is clear it's us burning fossil fuels moves carbon into the atmosphere and not traps more heat this is a fact\nSo we have a choice do we try to push it\nOr do we accept the truth as difficult as it might be when it came to making this Arctic Circle monument Steven Kristen chose option number two they open themselves up to the more complicated truths\nAnd it turned out to lead to something pretty darn cool [noise]\nThis is a moving to use it for us and spoke with which you know thing you can touch or see and that's interesting about the object is following this idea\n\nBully is the least important thing about the piece itself is the movement what the bulls does is it represents the movement\nWe humans don't really like change we like sharp lines from definitions but the actual physical world doesn't work that way it's really hard to find a straight line in nature instead they're curves twists and blurred boundaries and always always change\nEverything will every single thing that showed that\nEven if it turns out the Arctic Circle and an eight ball of concrete both of which are scheduled to leave the island in the year twenty forty seven\nI'm not swimming Christian and I go up there with a ... frames and kick it into the ocean\n[laughter] what it says Walker agreeing [laughter]\nSo the question we started with here is what is the Arctic and the answer anything above the ... line which fluctuates between sixty five and a half and sixty eight degrees north which is so messy and complicated there's really nothing about the Arctic that all these are
