meaning citizen of ancient Rome today citizen is way more than a city resident\nWhat does it mean though and who gets to define it big questions triggered this week by President Trump just ahead of the mid term elections he said he wanted to ban birthright citizenship the idea that being born in the U.S means automatic citizenship\nIn ... yesterday today we want to spend some time exploring different ideas about citizenship let's start with a simple document that is a powerful symbol of citizenship a passport\nOutside your home country your passport can dictate easy travel or blocked access because not all passports are created equal the world's ... starts us off\nIt takes a lot of courage to leave your day job to travel the world it takes even more coverage if you're not rich and

woman misses the world\nThinks the drop of fact there's a lot of interest around the globe in our mid term elections next week enough to send an Australian political strategist halfway across the planet Bruce hawk or is his name for the past month he's been traveling around the U.S speaking with voters and filming a documentary about it\nWhat struck him so far here's what he said in mind you this was before the Pittsburgh synagogue attack division was struck\nBy the amount of division in America or may not been traveling Houston's not in Ninety six to observe presidential campaigns and I've never seen anything quite like that everybody here and there is in their respective camp and\nIt's almost impossible to find anybody who is sitting on the fancy they're all in one Campbell the ... and have very very strongly held views about Donald Trump he is the story\nAnd I don't get a sense that Americans are very happy politically right now even those who ... hours on either side I think there's this sense of disconnect and it upsets people it's the same story everywhere we go\nOn happiness that really seems to be on the painting a lot of what we see and it's a disc quiet I think which is permeating American society right now even for people who very strong Trump supporters and we'll probably see themselves as being in the ascendency so that's the hard road that I think Americans are taking right now\nSo the big question you're trying to answer talking to American voters is what matters to you how varied had those answers been extremely ... food Trump supporters\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nThe tariff wars with China and the other side of the coin it's division it's the shouting out it's the singling out of minority groups and individuals that people find very offensive and drives a lot of their intentions in this midterm election\nYou know I mean the trade war on terror is that's not necessarily a good thing for people in the middle of the country farmers for example are you finding what\nThat is a fascinating thing you know we were just in Breckenridge, Minnesota just a few days ago and we conduct a little focus group they're primarily amongst farmers and what they told us was that even though ... not buying their crops the down by bad twenty five percent and returns\nThat were prepared to give Donald Trump a chance to sort out this war with the Chinese but then would speak to other ... that is well and good but ... now full and if we're not so at this problem at really soon begin to have another habits makes you not going to have anything to do with that\nSo it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal to a coal was kept out why the hip pocket and as we call it in stride but usually motivates what people's biting intentions of going to be\nMm have you ever seen a dynamic like that back in Australia it's very\nExcept in a strategy we do have something of a Trump phenomena and it usually comes with people who once calling the shots in a society where they feel they're being left that left behind\nAnd I will sometimes support candidates who don't represent their interests and that happened a few years ago when we had one called polling Hansen she's still around and she ran a political one nation very populist and\nShe was upsetting Asians and Asian tourists to strike but people in tourist dependent electorate voting full\nAnd sorry yeah sometimes people vote against their interests I read an article once and it said was ... votes of Thanksgiving sometimes that it just happens to the question now I think that we're going to have to be asking in two years' time if we come back as well\nHas Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because right now what we're saying is that people who might be sitting in the middle I'm more inclined to cite will give him a chance we're going to see how you guys and that may mean that the cycle blue wave that's coming might just be more of a ...\nThis is an issue like immigration or what we are talking about earlier ... how much did the opinions you heard from Americans vary depending on the region\n[noise] well it depended to a large extent actually in South Carolina you cannot get away from rice as an issue\nAnd people of color they were very very distressed they felt that that will being singled out by Donald Trump and in fact we spoke to a Seventy seven year old man African American who grew up in the eyes of segregation in South Carolina had refused admission in the lunch counters in restaurants and\nSort it has roars and he said he had never seen anything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he had never seen such of racism and he's view\nComing from a president with somebody and such high office he said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but he'd never felt the roar exposure\nThat's extraordinary Bruce you've been in the U.S before and as you know the mid term elections historically have low voter turnout what's it like in Australia is there a greater sense there that you have to take care of the civic responsibility of casting a vote willing\nTo strike and we have ... states that responsibility out of our hands and tell us we'll be fond if we die hard but a science take it for granted really that they have divided on election day and we have Ninety five percent turnout\nAnd that of course changes the nature of politics ... it means that the politicians are much more focused on the Santa rather than having to energize the base all the time\nIf you are have compulsory biting your politician in a strike you know that your traditional voters are going to come out and support you it's the people in the middle you have to convince and that means that as time politics even though it sounds very divisible times\nStill is much more inclusive in the basic tenants that on the pain the major political parties for example\nOr you know we have a national hills game which would never be touched by either the major parties I think in my lifetime it just is not an issue that I Know that if I Would do the pot from that that would be the end of their prospects of winning an election\nDo you get the sense that Americans are more motivated to go to the polls this year\nMassively more motivated everywhere we go way hearing reports from journalists and others that turnout is greater with early voting mental so registration that the Kevin uh issue has motivated and energized democratic voters particularly women\nSo on both sides with saying this remarkable energizing I'll be very surprised if we don't see\nTurnout and barrel say getting at reports that in states like Georgia where there's been allegations of vote a suppression that that it's had to resist effect and that there is a very high turnout before the election day by people who presumably are offended by what's happening there\nAnd one of the things that are being doing is talking to young people and asking them well what do you think about Donald Trump and the priority says he has a night basically say\nThat totally out of step with what we all worried about and the number one issue that we get back is climate change because this is the generation that's going to have to deal with these problems and the other is intergenerational dead\nBut they really do worry about climate and climate change\nAnd you can understand why you know I wouldn't be around to see the worst effects of climate change but they will not think that will become a bigger and bigger issue as this generation starts to assert more and more pal\nBruce Walker is an Australian political strategists he's been filming a documentary called a hard road travels and Trump's America\nWe'll speak with him again after the midterms\nBy the way if you're a new U.S citizen are voting for the first time here in America we want to hear from you what does voting mean to you and how does it compare with voting in another country email us at this address my world at the world dot org again that's my world at the world dot O. R. G.\nSo can we talk about your own role as later because you lead these highly classified missions in Iraq that led to miss all the all Zarqawi in two thousand six being killed you were also the top us commander in Afghanistan a war that's now entering its Eighteenth year\nAs soldiers are signing up as you know who were not even born when that war began is that a colossal failure of leadership\nWell I don't know if it's a failure of leadership because there's been some good leaders are certainly a failure of policy or its lack of success of policy if we're talking Afghanistan in particular\nOr you had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end\nThe reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of\nWhat he asked me to do but at a point an news story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone magazine that I didn't think was fair\nBut at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican\nThe number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans at probably says ... how we have an invasion coming a we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down there\nSince the idea that we're going to be decisive flipper really defending what we ought to do is put in drones out to get targeting and do airstrikes on the migrant convoy and just stop it before it gets close but of course that's absurd\nAnd that's immoral and that's not something that we're even thinking about doing but we shouldn't even send the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the Alamo however in some ways it is a crisis\nIt's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of a number of people who want entry into the United states in many cases they have a pretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras or Guatemala [noise]\nA lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal with a moral issue so I think it's\nWhen we talk about putting military around we almost confused the issue because the route issue here is one of our immigration policy and in America's values and we've got to look in the mirror decide what our values are adjust our policy reflects those and it's got to be a compromise because not all Americans are going to agree\nSo how do you feel our country is being led laid off from what is your take on the on the tone things up by the oval office\nDon't think our country is being led well it All right now but I Would expand it beyond the oval office I Would say on the left in the right there's a ... to the rhetoric now and this gets back to what we talked about earlier and values we need instead of looking at the TV and yelling at whatever side we don't like we need to look in the mirror\nAnd we need to say All right what are our values what do we want from our leaders because I don't expect the president to have the answers\nI expect the president to create an ecosystem in which the answers can be reached but I expect the president to reflect our values I expect to reflect the values for me I I expect the president to inspire me to be better than I might otherwise be\nWhen I Am weary and impatient I expect the president\nTo be the kind of symbol it says wow I Need to be a little more patient I lead to be a little more energetic whatever it is I Need to be a little more courageous a living\nTo reflect all the things that we hope we can be [noise]\nAnd does Donald Trump reflect your values does it reflect American values\nI think each of us has to ask ask ourselves that question I'm I'm at all when you does he reflect your values general I think I just answered that question I I don't believe that President Trump reflects the kind of inspirational leadership that I respond to\nBut I'm One person and the real question is how each of us do and we need to we need to be very honest with ourselves first and then with each other [noise]\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal his new book is leaders myth in reality thank you very much for being with us oh it's my pleasure
