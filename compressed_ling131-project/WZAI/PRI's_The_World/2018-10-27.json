part of the stand and vote campaign mark you were part of the protests and sit ins that went on in North Dakota against the Dakota access pipeline which has since been constructed what kind of you involved in that campaign\nThese water issues as they pertain to fossil fuel extraction was something that I already been working on for years many of the people that I worked with uh in in New York were native people and when Standing Rock was happening or I was invited to to come and stand with my native brothers and sisters to protect their water\nSo now you've given it a bit I'm Still working with with ah natives and getting out the vote I Know standing voting is a campaign geared toward native populations in the U.S and in a a big part of it it has to do with the Supreme Court upholding this North Dakota vote voter id law what does that law sang\nIt basically says that ah unless you have a a street address on your id in North Dakota you aren't a lot of\nMost of the people who live on reservations don't actually have a a a physical street address they use PO box is\nSo now that the Supreme Court has upheld that law one can people on residents\nComing up on midterms say you know they can they can give them a general street\nA jerk a street address 'em through the uh the native council through the tribal council in each reservation\nI I'm just curious if you're an actor and I I just wondered you call on different strengths their talents or in your activism than than in your acting career\nThis is a function that artists artists have historically perform bring light to uh those issues that um that are in the dark\nAnd um whether you're doing it on a on a stage a with ideas of play right you're doing it a movie with um with the struggles of human beings and storytelling or you're doing it directly in direct\nAction um like standing at Standing Rock Occupy Wall street or getting involved with the campaign or the fight against the war in Yemen\nUm these are part of the

almost like how could are good friends and allies be doing this to us if you talk to\nPeople off the record you know not on camera they would say yeah we all know that this sort of stuff goes on all the time we know that all major countries eased drop and spy on one another but they shouldn't\nBe doing in such open press ways\nThat seems to have gotten a bit last year you know as soon as being more reported on as you well you know this is just another son that Trump doesn't do what he's doing that he's reckless that he's endangering the security of everybody and hasn't generated nearly as much heat as say the letter bomb story which is\nThe reaction that Christopher described in Greece is exactly the same reaction that's happened here where they're saying that Trump has brought this on himself he's ratcheted up the tension um that's generating a lot more passionate about what each than the thought that someone's a hack Donald Trump's iPhone\n[noise] now I Can't have a journalist

smaller than Germany so it doesn't commands or attention here probably as much as we command their attention there but I think this sense is that you know the Greeks has done a pretty good job of trying to get their\nEconomic problems under control they basically done what the Germans have asked to them and that they should be given a break and of course\nYou know I'm In the medical has much

S. that sometimes goes unnoticed is the fact that immigrant workers are more educated than ever before they're just as likely to hold a bachelor's\nDegree as us citizens but often that education doesn't cross over which prevents people from continuing the careers they had back home reporter Ashley\nClique noticed this imbalance in the nursing world where there is a labor shortage which she also found programs trying to bridge the gap\n... was working as a nurse in Haiti when the massive earthquake struck in twenty ten she rushed to care for women she delivers babies\nI took care of people we try to be too much do they try to be taking care of their babies who\nDefines had found her calling but\nIn twenty sixteen she moved to New York to be with her husband she left her country and her career behind it gets to be a nurse in the U.S you have to be certified here it makes sense but it also means that despite eight years as a nurse in Haiti the phones had to start over\nI couldn't not work out as a nurse so I ... I suppose one thing I was on the phone and food\nHome health aide helping people with their meds food doctor says that's\nKind of so ... so isn't that a anything we're not going to nursing\nFor defense to be a nurse again she needed to pass the certification exam called the N quacks\nMost nurses educated in the U. S. nail it on their first try that only forty percent of immigrant nurses educated abroad make it through the fence tried setting on her own but the material in a language barrier overwhelmed her when she heard about a program at LaGuardia community college in New York\nTo help immigrant nurses like her products to test the programs tough six hours a day four days a week for eight months\nRemember what goes\nOn a refund evening about Fifteen minutes from all over the world hating Paul I'm Doris China sit with their prep books with paragraphs highlighted in pink and yellow tonight's lesson is on kidney failure\nFollow who should've though says what would you know there was a loss\nInstructor Phil ... moves through the answers while another instructor right that difficult words like Korea Team the towers and dilute it\nAnd are tired late many have families and other jobs town near as who works with the program says many of the students are like the Fonz under employed\nIf they are working there working minimum wage jobs where they have to sit on the sidelines and basically not use any of their skills and know how\nIt's no how the U.S needs at least one million more nurses will be in demand over the next few years to care for aging Americans an immigrant nurses coming out of this class are doing really well I'm not big certification exam but the Seventy five percent pass rate and that motivated to find to stick with it\nIf people before you\nMaybe they pass the exam they come from other countries they do let the fuck we seizing but you can do that too they not super not too old people [laughter]\nBut it's been hard for defense when she got into the test prep program her husband was stationed at an army base in Florida the phones knew she'd need to work weekends and study during the week and she couldn't do that well also caring for her baby daughter so she sent her daughter to stay with her grandma in Haiti all she studied for the test\nMyself who finds my son really to be able to finish the room\nShe did finish the program and pass and collects exam she's a nurse in the U. S.\nBut there's a hatch to work at a hospital in New York the phones is required to have a bachelor's degree to the phones have four and a half years of college three years of nursing school and a year plus of midwife training but the U.S doesn't count the midwife part\nSo they not consider or my your studies together so they just one Souter my nursing school so I have to believe again for my ... degree\nSo she signed up for college part time she should finish and about five years but at least at the nursing exam out of the way the Fonz had brought her daughter back from Haiti the family's altogether now [noise]\nAfter work one Saturday because I'm just husband makes a huge part of ... their daughter ride the bike up and down the hallway\nShe finished along shifted Alice this lab and still has class her to do for a degree [noise] but she says she's thinking of five years from now when she will be working in a hospital as a nurse for the world actually\nWell\nThat story is part of our brain game series on immigrants in education for more stories just go to the world dot org slash brain game\n[noise]\nYou're with the world\nAs a kids would go camping the late Allen Newhouse of Nantucket there was a little in ...\nWas the hall over way up to the head of the harbor were danker there and we'd have maybe a half a dozen Iraq both which sleep on them and of course grow which took some whiskey", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "27"}
