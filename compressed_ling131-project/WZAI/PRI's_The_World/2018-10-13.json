country's defense is by people hacking into them it's a sign of five scenario but it may not be that far from reality\nThat at least is the warning coming this week from a new report from the

themselves classified so nowhere in this report or the weapons systems themselves name we can do that these are everything from jet fighters to\nAnti missile interceptors an every kind of weapon system that the Pentagon is developing\nWow so so what kind of vulnerability is did the report find\nAll sorts of vulnerability is the scariest thing I think is that they found that basically an entire generation of Pentagon weapons seems to have been developed without cyber security in mind which means that these aren't necessarily vulnerabilities that are\nOnly for high level hackers to take advantage of these aren't like really hard to get into systems some of these things were just that they found beef fault passwords hadn't changed on the software of these systems so the testers were able to take over these systems completely just by guessing\nPasswords in one case it was as simple as guessing a password and nine seconds\nAnd in some in many cases\nThe DOT weapons developers did not notice that the testers were in their system acting like hackers and they even didn't notice when the testers we're trying to be intentionally noisy to make themselves visible so that they would be found even then they weren't found\nNow to be clear these are weapons systems that are already deployed or are they things that are being developed and are going to be deployed what what kind

wide range of issues that if you listen to President Trump you might think it all boils down to one thing dairy products from Canada\nThey've treated our farmers in Wisconsin and New York state that a lot of other states\nVery badly the new trade deals still needs legislative approval but at what gives us dairy farmers more access to Canadian markets Jason Margolis went to Ontario to hear from farmers there\nPhilip Armstrong's family has been farming in ... Ontario for a very long time for\nOur family has been on this piece of land since Eighteen sixty nine\nObviously dairy farming has lost a lot since then it's also made a huge leap sends Armstrong graduating college thirty seven years ago today each have is three hundred and eighty cows whereas a high tech color we watch is twenty four cows getting milk in the computer measures their output\nRecall there that they have on them [noise] his id but it's also measures her eating habits on an individual ... it measures for room in the stomach flu which to make sure that that's going well [noise] it measures are lying down time and measures are activity\nCombine that technology with better breathing and nutrition and Armstrong says his cows are nearly twice as productive as for decades ago this might seem great but it's also created a problem for the world's dairy farmers they're producing too much milk so to keep things in check\nFly management each farm has a quota and that's our share of the Canadian Marc\nThey match supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system Canada also places high tariffs on foreign dairy imports up to about three hundred percent\nThat's what's enraged President Trump's Canada does lead in some American dairy before terrorists kicking and that's part of the updated NAFTA Canada would open up a few percentage points more to the Americans\nYou go okay well so much for its role in in income or give up that allows us to modernize to expand so it's frustrating for us as dairy farmers\nAnd perplexing the dairy trade between the U.S and Canada is a sliver of overall trade between the two nations and Armstrong is annoyed that President Trump singled out Canadian dairy as the problem\nHe was distorting the facts or maybe didn't understand the fact that I don't know and so if we were hurting their dairy farmers well Americans had a six hundred million dollar surplus with us but he got in just had that we were mistreating their farmers\nMany American dairy farmers agreed with President Trump and applaud him for standing up for them they point out that Canada also recently redefined some of its milk products which could effectively shut out American products\nTheir pain is real thousands of small American dairy farms have shut down in recent years it's not all because of Canada bark from it they've been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices\nPeople are also consuming less milk a lot of male cat in the past has been dumped because it couldn't be processed and in an appropriate time or sold an extreme discount Brian Gould is a professor of agribusiness at the University of Wisconsin\nWell us dairy farmers maybe in a bad place ... says the U.S shouldn't be telling Canada how to manage its agriculture we had no right to do that I I really think we're in the nice when we demand that they get rid of their quota system gold says think of the reverse candidates telling us to dismantle its production system\nThe U. S. government's sets a minimum price for milk and provide some subsidies\nUs also has its own high tariffs on certain dairy products sour cream for instance it so I think it's I don't remember exactly it's like Graham Lloyd the c._e._o. of the dairy farmers of Ontario couldn't put his finger on the exact amount\nIn eighty seven percent and Lloyd says there are a lot of other us tariffs on other cheeses and I have like fifty percent earth Lloyd says this whole milk spat with Canada it's just politics\nWisconsin being a significant important states the Republicans namely obviously Speaker Ryan and it was a state that carry Trump became a political lately wrong and that is what started the whole process [noise]\nBack on the farm fill up arms says the new NAFTA agreement doesn't address the fundamental problem American farmers are producing too much milk and Armstrong believes opening a little bit more of Canada won't make a dent in that\nYou know I feel for the dairy farmer in the United states is ... what was happening his dinner her up here but it has no impact on their on their wellbeing it'll\nAgain plenty of Wisconsin in New York former see things differently they're glad to have more access\nTo a Canadian markets still there is an ironic twist here many American dairy farmers and organizations are actually now looking into a supply management system of their own similar to Canada's for the world Jason Margolis ... Ontario\nI'm this week we've been obsessed with what could be a murder story the victim Saudi journalist on October second ... entered the Saudi Arabian constantly in Istanbul and it's not been seen since we're not the only ones obsessed\nInside Saudi Arabia and outside I think we're all trying to figure out what happens I hadn't\nThought I thought of it is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker who made a documentary critical of Saudi Arabia she also new Jamal ... like him she lives outside the Saudi kingdom because she says speaking up can get you in trouble with the authorities there\nDissidents human rights activists or even just simple critics of what's going on Saturday for the past few years have been put in prison\nTaken from different countries and brought back to Saudi Arabia and such amount of the highest profile of something that's been going on inside tied to radio for more than a year now let's say and that gave me the\nSouth I tell us again what happened to you after you produced a documentary\nSo that the government officially accused me of supporting terrorism and so this shows a lack of understanding of the government itself of what is independent trimmer because there isn't anything called independent journalism and Saudi Arabia and so like for a lot of people even when I was being interviewed about the film there were like\nI argue Saudi dissident and it's like no I'm a journalist was covering the story but because there is no such platforms inside Saudi Arabia where you can take these things we all become dissidents inadvertently and there was no other space\nAnd this is the problem with with with how the Saudi Government dealing with everyone right now they are shutting down even though my oldest of comments and critique about\nTheir policies and so they've left no room for us they've left no room for us to be able to properly cover stories and that they love criticizing journalists for not understanding what's going on in Saudi Arabia and so it's a lose lose situation for us\nHas has the government clamped down harder since Mohammed bin Salman came\nI Can't lose her absolutely on everyone's ... I mean\nLike ... before you could be a human rights activists on for example woman driving or being critical of the economic reform in Saudi Arabia and there wouldn't be as much backlash as now we thought like a lot of the activists that had been arrested before the ban was lifted that that would be released by now but instead of being ...\nA lot more pressure has been put on them and they're using them or ... it's insane\nStuff I'm I'm at is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker we've been speaking to her from Washington I think you saw that ... [noise]\nOh [noise]\nInitiated the emergency abort sequence and the capsule that they were writing on\nPerformed what's known as a ballistic reentry and that's when you come in at a much steeper angle when you land on earth so I think they experienced nearly seven jeeze which is seven times earth's gravity so pretty intense flight um but they landed safely and they were able to be reunited with their families and\nUltimately it was a good and happy ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start their land and\nI Believe they're about thirty miles up so they weren't quite in space yet but they were almost there the astronaut noted that they experienced a moment of weightlessness which you're not supposed to be failing at that part of the flight and I think that had to do with the fact that there were no longer connected with a booster and then at that point they start spending and the ... century and then they're parachutes deployed\nTo slow them down to that they could land safely\nThey're not spending as they're racing to the earth early\nYeah they are [laughter] God I've\nDone what is known as a parabolic flight\nThat's when you feel weightlessness for a moment to time and during the ... experience extra D's and it feels like something is pressing down on you like a mattress I didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're ill so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\n[noise] are there any new details about what might have caused this problem I don't know if they've traced\nThe exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separations so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four\nOr and they were supposed to break away but Russia things that maybe there was some contact between one of the boosters and the center core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely this was the sixty ... of this particular Soyuz rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact\nBut I think that's the leading theory at the moment\n[noise] none of us and Russia they're frequently an odds especially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight why is that\nNASA has been kind of shiny beacon of hope in our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics inter now it definitely creeps into other aspects when Russia invaded Ukraine that\nKind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has had\nAn impact on other parts of our space infrastructure but when it comes to NASA we just can't let those things get and the way we need then at the moment because the soy is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not that Russia will let geopolitics get in a way that\nIs significant setback for the international space station\nI Would say it's definitely concerning about the nation's future we currently have three astronauts\nInto orbit on the station and they're going to have to come home eventually they got up there and just the way as as well and the Soyuz capsule can't last forever and or but they have a two hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days\nInto that so there are slated to come down in December it could probably stretch that to January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down soon or Russia could possibly launch an empty phrase capsule and send that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board but that\nHasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen it just depends on what the investigation finds\nLearned brushes
