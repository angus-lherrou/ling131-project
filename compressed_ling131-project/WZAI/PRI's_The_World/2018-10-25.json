the bat you\nMiss listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations\nI don't want to try to grab the is I don't want to go back ... that's right that's\nA market where a man this is the world lately things have been pretty tense between the U.S and China not just over trade and tariffs earlier this month and a major speech vice president Mike Pence took aim at China's leaders\nThere contesting America's geopolitical advantages in trying in essence to change the international order in their favor under President Trump's leadership the United states has taken decisive action to respond to China with American action\nOther areas of friction included the south China Sea Taiwan human rights intellectual property not to mention President Trump accusing China of meddling in the mid term election campaign David Rennie writes the blog one column and the economy is so big question David here is this a new Cold War with China\nDoesn't have to be an China is extremely keen that it should not be they don't even want to trade will and they are pretty desperate to avoid one and work out what America wants\nBut it used to be just a few hardliners here in Beijing who saw that America actually couldn't be negotiated with that America wanted to contain China and to stop China's rise\nThat fringe of hardliners is now spreading an awful lot of Chinese leaders look at the speech by vice president Mike Pence attacking China for a a cut of laundry list of complaints they look at how Donald Trump isn't really engaging\nWhen it comes to winding down this potential trade ... and they're starting to wonder whether\nHappening to them which is that just as they were poised to become a kind of great super power of the top of the sudden economic totem pole America in its last kind of\nDying vengeance as a kind of aging heck I'm On has two sides to try and soaps and and so that is the that is the question that Beijing leaders ... and they absolutely will not looking for this fight right now the busy trying to become rich and powerful and this has come out of out of the blue cap the\nWell the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP that was supposed to give us some leverage with some of those issues like intellectual property rights for Trump pulled out of it\nThat's right I mean those are those ... a retired very senior American officials in Beijing last week and it was all off the record like on a navy man but he was a kind of household name in this day and he comes to trying to ... for business or an stokes the Chinese they take advice from him\nAnd he had a small dinner for a group of us in Beijing we're discussing what Donald Trump wants on you know I was discussing having into the Trump the times about China went understood in DC I kind of put it to him and he was kind of uncomfortable but then said that maybe there was something to this that\nThe problem is that the machine in Washington\nHas kind of systematic structural things but it wants China to do differently\nTo play by the rules to try and fix the world trade older as you say Marco\nTo you know to what was something like the TTP where everyone opens their markets that bull Donald Trump I think is a systems kind of guy I think he has a number of very powerful very instinctive ideas and I think if you look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if\nYou know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically\nValuable piece of real estate and that\nPrevious presidents and America's administrations were too dumb and to kind of kindly to charge enough rent to the rest of the world access to that market and so it's like you know Donald Trump's back in his real estate days he's he he he owns a valuable property this time it's called the United states\nAnd it's time to review the rent and it's not going to be pleasant for the guy on the other side of the table but there isn't gonna biggest structural\nKind of vision of how to run the world trading older it's just it's time you paid a lot more rent I I think that's the core of what Donald Trump is up to right now\nWhat is China's vision for the world\nHe's a really interesting saying the Chinese joined the world Trade Organization Seventeen years ago and have basically been gaming the system ever since uh\nWell it's tough because China has an incredibly clear vision of where it wants to end up it has a very clear and gold and you know broadly that's to be one of the world's most powerful to countries and so powerful that no one else gets to say no to them\nTo go how they get that\nIs not actually so important that quite opportunistic if one policy looks block they'll try another\nIf there's too much pushback then there'll be nice for but that's very very kind of cross through by feeding the ... the Chinese kind of fries and and\nFor a long time they gave me the will trading system and and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months to trade tensions and you get this when he took the European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing\nIt turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike\nMore than an American led worlds trading older is no rules a tool\nAnd so suddenly the Chinese have been undermined the rules gaming the rules playing the system so I think they realize that the one thing they don't want to do is to lose the system completely so suddenly the Chinese are quite in the order of reforming the company's CEO and no longer kind of cheating so much so there is all this kind of\nThis will be moving parts where you could actually see something quite positive\nComments is the problem is\nThat you can also see some very negative kind of forces that could feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction\nOr I'm absolutely confident that the Chinese don't actually know how to play this ... because reasonably senior Chinese officials are now working their way down the list of people who can explain watching them and they go so low down the list are asking people like me and I literally have conversations with what I say\nI'm going to pose a it's not my job to tell you you know how to handle the Americans but they're all ski everyone is this trade war avoidable\nGraham Allison over at Harvard coined the phrase a few cities trap tell us what that is and how the Chinese said\nShe says this was an ancient Greek historian heroes about when you had a a very militaristic rising power sponsor coming up against us so stay ... Athens it ended up inevitably lead to war and so he analyzed a number of occasions I have a human history where\nThe status quo power finds itself being challenged by an upstart\nAnd in a depressing number of cases that does trigger armed conflict I mean you could be an optimist in say the Chinese are busy trying to get rich that trying to become more powerful they are absolutely not looking to solve the Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time even for a trade war\nAll sort of thing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of the phone with us from getting them I think he's not physically kind of war like person these kind of ... soft handed kind of New York real estate guy [noise] um so do you think that as people itching to go to war\nBut the dynamics can get a bit of weight from you when you've got these two big big countries\nBut no longer think that they are\nConfined win win solutions you know this does feel weirdly zero some now it feels as though the American charges that China's rise is at America's expense\nAnd that this is a kind of wind before trying to get so big\nThat it's too late to stop it it's it's a window to try and bend the cup and there was this story building Trump said I think it was at the U.N General assembly speech when he said the previous presidents have sort of\nBeen ready to watch China rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch that wasn't going to happen quite so see that's a really extraordinary statements and in a previous American presidents said\nYou know if you're going to rise let's make sure you rise in the right way you're going to rise as a responsible stakeholder remember that phrase that people used to use about China that it was going to become a kind of a member of the grace and good uh pogo ... along with everyone else but Sedona Trump to say at least as a piece of rhetoric\nThis is a concern all around the globe right now like in Brazil\nWe've been reporting on the heated presidential election runoff in Brazil this weekend right wing candidate ... was facing off against left his opponent Fernando ... died this information and fake news have been huge issues in that race a lot of it is playing out on the messaging platform what's up which we should note is owned by Facebook\nDoes it or a quarter of a is a Brazilian researcher now in Boston studying all this at Harvard joined student center she's also involved in an effort called ... a collaboration between twenty five Brazilian newsrooms to identify and the bunk fake news\n... tells me that the fake stories she's seeing on what's up are out of control\nWe make fun actually because the the misinformation campaign preview day sometimes can get absurd in what way at the support in and be nice and fears that are totally\nKnown things like Venezuela I supported by Hezbollah or stuff like this\nAnd I was coming here and I had a discussion we friend that teaches at Harvard she was trying to convince me that the right wing candidate wasn't the antidote to brand new not because\nAnd by the Hezbollah so ... was this teacher Brazilians\nShe's ... she's president and she probably heard this thing's via watch that\nAnd I I started to last and it was like yeah you know what listen here to the website of control over this is ally this this this is nonsense please you're a teacher at Harvard [laughter] but people believe this thing's\nSo is that one of the rumors the Hezbollah connection with Venezuela is that one of the rumors at spreading on what's happened Brazil\nYes this is bringing you this is fresh room or [laughter]\nThan there are the older still rumors making a comeback as Brazil's presidential race heats up\nFor example we had a real more about the last candidate being the creator of something called ... which is supposed to be an educational cheat to teach kids how to be gay\nWow [laughter] the the implication being if you vote for the left wing candidate you're going to have gay kids in schools and there will be connections with the government and a Venezuela and Hezbollah the same time I see what you're saying absurd\nUm just to be clear what definitive links have there been between these disinformation campaigns and either political candidate like the charge enjoyable scenario launch those yeah that'll legitimate claim\nThis is a rule more from two thousand twelve it's just you up in the website of the right wing candidate\nHe created this a false information he was a a a member of the the Congress so he took this issue to the Congress and several Congress person that are really changes they supported him in this story and this became a monster\nBoth and I was also accused of creating another monster a big one last week a Brazilian newspaper reporter that the right wing candidate was working with local marketing firms to buy a bundle of phone numbers\nAnd use them to mask taxed propaganda to Brazilians through what's up Brazilian authorities are investigating those claims in the meantime people like you as a record of a are trying to put out the flames before they turn into a fake news wildfire and Brazil\nWhat's very interesting is that as far as I've seen of watch the news and disinformation there is no story that is not in both platforms Facebook and watch that and what we see a different types of presentation\nYou have an all you see like there's this thing happening you have to act so there's a call to action that's very strong shared days otherwise our country is going to be a Venezuelan five years share this to save our country stuff like this\nOn Facebook you have the same narrative is the same narrative but Facebook is more sophisticated they have videos they have text specialist opinions all the things that make\nPeople believe so what I see is that there's an entire system if you look just to watch that\nUh we're not getting all the picture\nI mean I ... I don't want to suggest that Brazil is different from any other place in the world but I mean is there a kind of a cultural thing here with the contagion of these these fake news stories\nYes we have a a social and economic component that need to be taken into account when you talk about fake news and what what are those because I think we have a huge inequality and poor people are left behind him in so many things and including education\nWe have a level of instability that was provoked by the impeachment\nOf Duma that may people is a former President Bill yeah uh that makes ... made people does believing in and they don't believe in ... anymore neither the government or the newspapers\nOr and I know there is no easy tuitions that they would believe right now and um this is also very important when you study fake news because people tend to believe\nIn the misinformation campaigns instead of leaving the institutions or newsrooms\nThat was recorded on how fake news is playing out of Brazil's presidential election quarter of a studies this information out of Harvard shore and seeing center she's also involved with ... a collaboration with Brazilian newsrooms and social media companies to take fake stories off their platforms\nRunoff election in Brazil by the way takes place this Sunday oh\n[noise]\nThere's a very well preserved shipwreck long at the bottom of the black sea off the coast of Bulgaria it is so old old as it it made it back to a time when Aristotle was alive\nIt's found by a team of researchers using a remote controlled submarine they found more than sixty shipwrecks in total deep and the black sea including this one Seventy five foot Greek trading vessel which they estimated been lying under water for the past two thousand four hundred years\nWhich they say might make this the oldest intact shipwreck ever discovered professor John Adams was the principal investigator for the black sea maritime archeology project\nThe most ... I think about this useless to these ... actually complete complete the mosque to still standing the super structure is that the reading benches are still across the hall both of them with a list of the time it looks very much like some of the crop to fix his own a theme in fifth century bc vases\nI never thought I'd see anything like that in my life\nSeveral members of the team have also noted the ship bears a striking resemblance to the one on the siren posit the British Museum and that bothers you see an image of a ... strapped to the mass as this ship sails past three sirens\nMarine archaeologist Dr Helen far says this discovery could help historians connect some thoughts about travel in the classical world\nWe have a free for a vaccine fix says that lots of land and take action that the Mets training is out we need that we didn't have with the shipwreck say this really hills and missiles off that takes us on\nIt's unlikely that the ship will ever be displayed on land the reason the shipwreck has remained in such good condition for so long is the water it's been submerged in for centuries the black sea is and knock sick or free of oxygen and more than a mile below the surface there's not much marine life to disturb the wreck here's professor Adams again\nWell let me look safe perfect to us [noise]\nThere's very little physical strength left in between those two thousand four hundred years there's a long time there were bacteria would work inside the souls of the woods and they're still actually actively even offer was tough to say that means the wood has a new mechanical strength so you have to lift it piece by piece and even then it would be very very different\nSo I think we all technology that we have available to us now we can record is in ...\nWithout even touching but it's probably federal where it is\nOther finds by the black sea maritime archeology project include Roman trading vessels and seventeenth century ... rating fleet a two hour film about the discovery was shown at the British Museum in London yesterday\n\n\n\nStill ahead Egypt and singer Dina el with Dee Dee tells me about the fan boys that are shows in Cairo here with the world [noise]\n\nThey were first called penguins and the former recorded history uh we reckon that the great ox were abundant on the entire eastern at fighting from Norway down to ... and actually have been found in a cave paintings in the Mediterranean naturalistic", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Brewster", "day": "25"}
