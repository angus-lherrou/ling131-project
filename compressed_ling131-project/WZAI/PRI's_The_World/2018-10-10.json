the hotel industry achieve the goal they've been fighting for for a long time getting their employers to do more to protect them from sexual assault\nThis made headlines a few years back when a hotel housekeeper accused Dominique Strauss Kahn the former head of the IMF of sexual assault that case was settled out of court but the problem never went away here's the world's Alison at at a\nImagined is you're a woman working in an office and you're in the middle of a meeting all of a sudden your meal co worker starts to undress it's hard to imagine that happening right well if you're a hotel housekeeper chances are it has happened to you\nYou know I'm not three times and I'm assuming oh no one's in the room so I'm going to put my key and I'm going into the room so this particular time you know I'm not answered there isn't I mean these gases than in a completely ...\nThat's ... she's a housekeeper at a large hotel in Chicago she asked me not to use her last name or the name of the hotel where she works she's worried about how speaking out my impact her job she says that when this happened she was more than just scared\nLike it just it made me feel discuss the angry so I just kinda like bag the just left\nShe recorded a tour manager but she says nothing was done\nSo it's one of those things happen so much in housekeeping where your managers kinda fits\nAnd they just say okay you don't go back to their own today\nBut she did have to go back she brought another woman so she wouldn't have to be alone and fortunately that guest wasn't there but he wasn't asked to leave\nSo in twenty sixteen when members of her union UNITE HERE wanted to ask her and her co workers some questions about sexual assaults on the job she knew this was her chance to make change happen\nI'm like oh okay and one of my coworkers within the next ... and she's like you know just kind of knows me like you know they come and talking about sexual harassment and I'm I'm like this is our opportunity to kind of share things that we\nDeal with everyday with Tony and other housekeepers in the union set up to survey more than five hundred women about their experiences on the job\nNearly sixty percent of women they talked with dealt with some form of assault by hotel guest\nThat lead to action last year house keepers in Chicago successfully lobbied for device to keep them safe it's called the panic button and it was part of the city wide campaign known as hands off pants on so this is one solution\n[noise] [noise] it's it send a message that I was in danger in the room\nThat's already for her age she's the head of housekeeping at the Witte hotel she shows me how the safety device works press the button and hotel security is on the way [noise]\nHoge emigrated here in the nineties from what was then Yugoslavia she's always worked as a housekeeper\nStories not uncommon according to a study done by the American immigration council the top occupation for foreign born women here in the U. S. is housekeeping with nearly nine hundred thousand women working in this sector\nFor Hoge having the panic button has made her and her staff safer I honestly think there's a great think it is great that Chicago hotels are required to give this device to housekeepers but sexual assault in the hotel industry is a global issue so what are some of these larger\nChains like Mary I tuned to keep their workers safe say in Paris or to buy\nTheir such heightened awareness around safety and security so we're dialing up and MySpace but I think it's important to remember there is no one magic answer\nThat's Erica Alexander she's the chief lodging services officer from Marriott International\nUp in the U.S and Canada but the company has no current plans to put panic buttons into the hands of their workers in other countries\nThat for us it's a huge problem because we understand that you know Mariette brand should be doing the right thing whether they're here in the United states around the world\nThat's Cathy find gold she's the international director of the AFL CIO she says that back in June housekeepers from Chicago presented at an international labor conference in Geneva they inspired other housekeepers working in South Africa and around the globe to push for hands off pants on campaign\nPractice that's happening here in the United states and Mary I can do it here in the United states they can do it in China where they had a massive expansion they can do it throughout Asia throughout Latin America\nBefore the me too movement last year house keepers like Tony I didn't have much of a voice when it came to safety on the job [noise] they've been trying for years to get their employers to protect them\nAnd then all of a sudden all of this stuff started showing up in the news and I'm just like this is incredible on my because ... like we we all had the same feeling like we've started something\nAnd they have five of the major hotel chains have promised to install panic buttons in older hotels nationwide by twenty twenty but for so many people around the globe workings housekeepers there's no problem that can press to stop them from being assaulted on the job\nFor the world Alison ...

intelligence can take you to the far end of the earth remote villages in Russia for example but getting into can also be as easy as going online and doing a few searches the investigative news websites belly cat and the insider did boats\nAnd in the process managed to reveal the likely identity one person allegedly involved in the poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. the suspects name is Dr Alexander Michigan\nAccording to the investigation he's a trained military doctor who worked for the G R U Russian Army intel\nThe ... cat reporters who worked on this case you went through a pretty a lengthy process to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with\nWhat we had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities had really about the cover daddy's at this guy so we now know his real name is Alex ... before he was Michigan he was known as Oxnard Petra which was his coverage was totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere for him to travel under\n[noise] um and so we had some information about that cover identity including his birthday um where he had to pass passport issue too which is a very small town in the middle of nowhere [laughter] I'm In northern Russia\nSo that was a good starting point so talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably use some of the same information or discover identity from his real identity [noise] so we looked into a bunch of databases some of them are openly available some of them are leaked um Russia is a very corrupt and leaky society and because of that they're leaked databases\nFrom driver's licenses and insurance stuff and voter registration and addresses and stuff all over the Internet you can find if you just know where to look so we cross reference everything we could find and we found them ... about a guy named Alex in Michigan at the same birth dates and this from roughly the same village in the middle of nowhere and northern Russia\nAnd after a bunch of digging including actually sending someone to go to this tiny little village where he's from and finding locals who knew him\nApparently he was a local DJ on before he went on medical school yeah he was he a DJ at the local clubs one club I'm sure they had in a tiny village so we once these hunters in these databases across represent a tiny bit of information we think would probably matched the true identity of Michigan\nI go to see some of the steps in in your process the you and your investigators really seemed to have to put your cells in the mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this is just a lot of very creative thinking thinking of um any vulnerability of what would leave a paper trail from a spy and Russia so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all been forged in his new way forever but again these spies real lives to they have a family they have kids\nSo you can find information that would track back to them so I mean yes maybe some of this is kind of spy Ware it but a lot of very very basic routine research on this stuff you learn and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for any interesting details a cross referencing them and see what's on your matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the Kremlin\nRegister to address as as the headquarters of the cherry which when first glance it's absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public\nAddress like on his driver's license to address the you know see I ... the equivalent of the CIA [noise] well he did it because uh you know if he gets pulled over in his car the cop pulls up his address and he sees the address of the you know the Russian CIA more or less and he's like oh actually no everything's me up and up you can just go you know you're fine so\nUm that we ran the address I'm an air traffic database we found is three hundred and five men all between the ages of twenty five hundred fifty\nWho all have the same register to address or just this one address in Moscow so all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you and they all lifted their vehicle registration as his address 'cause they just don't want to be a traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get pulled over drunk driving or speeding the cop just let them go right because they don't want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services\nSo really everything just goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how a lot of the owner abilities how were you able to research this um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news and treat me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange sloppy knows so what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and his butt intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose that always possible right because you know every time any investigation ... Russia people always chime in and saying well they wanted you to find it very well if\nThey want us to find out why is no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance registration for these vehicles to the jury you headquarters you know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new agencies address saying like Jerry you address it again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to again just corruption and laziness\nA few weeks ago your website ... identified as a second person allegedly involved with this group all poisoning I have is already some UK or anywhere else been in touch with you about your findings\n[noise] um no no no not really all I mean I don't really have any and I don't think Elliot our\nFounder has contacts with you ... [noise] um so we don't know what they're thinking for all we know they discovered this all weeks and weeks ago or maybe in this all completely news that we honestly have no idea\nYou know just listening to what you said about all the available data that is on line is it impossible to be a spy in the digital age\nIt depends I I again I don't know if I have no idea I've never worked in intelligence services but I'm sure you can do it in some ways but it's much much harder than ever been before\nThat was our solar with the new site a belly cats together with their partners that the insider and I said\nIntelligence officers suspected of poisoning for Russians sought Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the u._k. back in March\n[noise]\nExcalibur she said no actually what the eight year old said was way better stay tuned and you'll find out on the world\nSince I was old enough to hold something I've been holding the fishing pole joker rue of Marion me my mom my dad we're all fishing that day trolling the ... and then\nI could see the pokey on the top of water spinning and flipping I told that I was like I think might poke he's dead but fast they swim fast they hit the fish in St on it then they come back", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "10"}
