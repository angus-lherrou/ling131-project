Africa's security correspondent joined us from Nairobi a really outstanding piece of investigative journalism Tommy what made you and the team think you could actually practice case\n[noise] well I think first of all it was just the the shock\nThat gripped everyone who saw this video right from the beginning\nAnd began you know just conversations across to each other with different research is reaching out and saying does anybody know whether this is as anybody have any idea\nWhat the what the terrain um links to and that's how the conversation started lots of people talking and then the b._b._c. picked up on that and became a full on the investigation\nWhat country this happened in them and getting more specific details about where in that country how did you figure out the location and what role did open source technology played in that [noise] well [noise] I mean it it\nParts of this whole collaboration festival looking at that that could be anywhere in the ... which is why it across west in Central Africa a botched with many heads put together one of them was Amnesty International their rights group which\nHad been researching northern Cameroon and about the military that and you know also when people when you listen to the video and you know\nLooking at the uniforms listening to some of the dialogue in it I'm an amnesty with their research as well they suggest that\nThis was camera and this was northern capital and of course that's also a vast\nRegion but over time trying to match the topography as you could see in the video that sets in distinct outlines of the mountains in the video and\nUsing those rich lines matching them to Google a digital globe and other imagery providers using geo location that's how you know this whole all moved on and and the location was matched\nI've found that part a little bit difficult to kind of understanding how you were able to know that that ridge line match the contours of what you found on GPS I mean that's the only original and that has that shape and all of common room\nIt's painstaking work it's it's not something that was very easy but there were so many clues put together so it's not just the rich line I could be any Richland but when you have one clue when you have another clue you sort of bring them together\nAnd that narrows the results you get so for example looking at different times for example when second buildings existed was his when they did not so going back in time and looking at different elements of that and adding everything together so it's it's something that took\nQuite a bit of time and more than a dozen people working on it\nYeah and you also worked with Kathy open source research group which is seriously experience on this kind of stuff I'm ... how did you figure out who was responsible [noise] well\nFirst of all the government tried to deny initially that these ... soldiers they said you know the uniform on was not watch\nUm the the soldiers would way up north um they said the guns and not the ones issued to come Munoz soldiers but we did identify some of the guns one of them as a staff I Am Twenty one which is used by some divisions of the kind of Indian Army will serve on some of the the uniforms where indeed ... ministry uniforms and and so we were able to\nFound that those were Kembrew Indian soldiers but then in the dialogue is well some of the soldiers was saying each other's names one of them was was referred to as Churchill or another one is called sign guy but around the same time before the b._b._c. investigation came out the camera and government actually arrested\nSeven men seven soldiers so they changed that tone and said while they had the rest at seven people in in relation to this video and\n... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video to some of the ones that were arrested and some of those names when nicknames but on the on the official list they had the official name zone so we could match that we can use\nFacebook as well to match some of those details of your parents still you know you've found church on Facebook right yes indeed um that's that's the nickname of a soldier called ...\nAnd apart from just to Facebook you know we found a will to speak to a former can ruin your soldier who also confirmed that this wasn't the Joe Joe so somebody who who knew him\nHave you been able to find out and the team been able to find out any possible motive for the violent crime to women to children including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to to these uh women as Boko Haram so saying that they are members or at least affiliated with Boko Haram\nAnd there's a point where I Am I'm One of the soldiers sort of a tells this child that I'm Sorry we have to do this kind of thing and and and\nUm basically saying it's it's your parents' fault that you are getting killed as well um so you know the soldiers and no forwarding these women and children any any access to to fat trial to a fair trial or they just you know execute what they consider justice on the spot\nYou know I guess we'll see how many crimes like this are are invisible what kind of feedback to this investigation has the b._b._c. Africa gotten from the public like from Cameroon and the jury itself\nFeedback has been overwhelming and people of all walks of life from around the world responding to this and saying you know well done on the work\nUm but I think one thing that people are most fascinated by is the method you know the location that use of mathematical calculations calculating for example you know the angle of the sun and using that versus the length of a shadow and using that to tell what time when exactly this happened so those\nThe audiences I'm so there's been a lot of praise for that and a lot of people hoping that more can come out a cameraman and people in particular had been calling for more to be done to hold their their government and that forces accountable\n[noise] the video or you have to say is very disturbing how're you doing and the others on the investigative team\nUm it's it's not an easy video to what to watch um [noise] you know it's it's it's difficult to you know once you've seen it festivals even believe that that happened and and and the shock\nAnd it's something you can't really you race from your from your mind so uh it's not something easy to watch\nA ... isn't necessarily job to to be done to when you have to expose these kinds of things um the loss of atrocities around the world sometimes you have to go to the hard way uh to be able to to get to the ... of these things and expose them\nThat's my colleague taught me a lot of people the BBC's Africa security correspondent thanks very much You're welcome [noise]\nYou know let's say that a child was moved from a facility where there were maybe thirty bad a capacity for thirty children so much more of a home environment they have access to education so they'll receive some kind of classroom instruction and basic\nYou know basic subjects all in some English the also have regular attention they'll have regular access to medical care to um you know mental health support psychologist [noise] a lot of these children are suffering or you know I may have experienced some kind of trauma either you know in home country is the reason for leaving and\nOr possibly route and so and so it's very important that these children have\nYou know the attention that they need and the access that they need to and so I think in a big facility when we turn to these big facilities like turning out of this emergency facility we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education um the the kids you know we were told the kids get work walks but\nThat's not a education you know a far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of melt mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really ad hoc it's really the onus has been on the child to to ask for it but you know they've\nJust been transition there from a different facility they don't know anyone there disoriented you know their possibly upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids um it's quite destabilizing\nYeah ... ... when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help if they can access\n[noise] um well that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but you know by and large children at the permanent shelters are provided with an you know your rights\nPresentation um they received screening and so in some cases some of the children are able to get legal support through those avenues\nFor some other facilities to turn into you know my understanding is that they're not receiving any more no you're right that tornado I'm at the time came facility and you know the access to legal services there has been very difficult so again it is concerning\nMeantime the administration and its supporters say the immigration system is broken and Congress needs to fix it um how do you respond to the\nShow I mean I think we have a\nSystem we have a a protection system in place a lot of these kids are seeking protection\nIn this country we have that in place [noise] you know could improve short I think what's really missing is investment in the system there is a huge backlog of cases we need more immigration judges more support staff\nFor those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process instead of saying oh the process doesn't work because it's so slow or oh the process doesn't work for other reasons I think it's it's chronic lack of investing in a system\nWe we need to prioritize getting kids out of getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them it's just not a ... it's not a long term it's not a good solution we need to get kids out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um or are you hopeful\nMy hopeful you know I I Am hopeful in the sense that I think I'm I'm I'm\nYou know the public is engaged on this issue I think I'm Congress has been very engaged in this issue um and you know doing a lot of visits certainly to different shelter is looking at this this issue holistically from from a rival to the immigration courts and so I'm hopeful there's a lot of oversight on this right now but I'm obviously\nIt's one thing to have that versus you know commitment to funding you know and and hiring more judges and you know to really think children to appropriate and safe sponsor as soon as possible\nTrouble as an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time well thank you very much\nPresident Trump crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months\nOne of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency\nThis change would essentially mean that anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government by access and government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card\nAdvocates fear this could lead to families here in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of reporting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for loosely says she's ...\nPediatrician and Washington a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nSo this proposed rule as a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who was applying for a visa or for\nPermanent residency so what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents are immigrant families with an unfair choice either keep yourself and your children healthy but risk being separated\nFor using these services such as Medicaid or snap also called food stamps or forego those vital services that include healthcare and Nutrition Assistance or your family can remain together in this country so really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to child and family health\nSo the rule uh obviously still proposal phase but what chilling effect so are you already are seeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with families is fighting to descend roll from these vital services just in case it could be used against them in the future\nAnd this includes even opting out of programs again like snap and even ... or the women infants and children program and four months parents have been asking us if it's safe for them\nTo access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal the draft of which is nearly four hundred and fifty pages so parents are choosing to play it safe and remove themselves from programs that they qualify for so it's a very confusing and scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you couldn't tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nSo I'd say that one of the many situations that troubled me in particular is that more and more I'm seeing new moms with newborns who are only a few days old choosing not to sign up for these services so as recently as last week I cared for baby who was only four days old\nAnd as many new moms I'm the mom was motivated to breastfeed was having a difficult time doing so as she was also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom I'm so they usually do I talked about the\nMany benefits of federal programs that provide\nBreastfeeding support or formula is needed or food assistance but she declined I'm\nAnd she said that she'd heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S [noise] so so I worry about this baby and many babies in similar situations who are starting their lives without all of the support that they could get if their families were not being place in the situation of you\nChild I saw last week but so many others over the last several months that I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and across and possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal status\nRight right so they're being forced to decide between either\nStability in the U. S. with and a new status or choosing their family's house which is really an impossible choice for the message that immigrant families are hearing is that they have to make that choice either health care and food or seeking permanent legal status in the United states\nRight and it's not just medical benefits that will be affected right I mean it's a whole range of other benefits that could ultimately have an effect on people's health\nRight exactly so with the the programs that are affected include Medicaid so which\nWhich really is a lifeline for a lot of my family's they would not be able to afford the preventive care the specialty care that dental care that all kids need if they didn't have Medicaid and includes programs like snap\nOr food stamps that provides healthy foods and includes housing assistance I'm and other services that actually allow them\nTo be healthy and stable so that they can contribute to the United states to our economy to our society\nAlone rifle Lucy pediatrician in Washington with the Children's National health system also a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics thank you very much for being with us thank you for having me\nLet's take a minute so you know about a remarkable story will have tomorrow it's about a man named Jesse she lives in California he comes from a Mexican American family he's been incarcerated for half of his life and he was told early on in prison not to mix with inmates who are not like him\nYou know we don't engage with them we don't do business with them and if you do you're going to get in trouble at least you're going to get beat up at war she wouldn't give stab\nBut that's not true in every president we go to one where change is happening and image like Jesse are part of the change that story coming up tomorrow [noise]\nYou're listening to the world [noise]\nMuslim and from a town on Martha's Vineyard drummer song well the twentieth\nOur starting to get pretty hardy gonna sixteen to Eighteen or actually seem to be when when you're in a bit of a state and uh [laughter] running just rolls right along [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Brewster", "day": "02"}
