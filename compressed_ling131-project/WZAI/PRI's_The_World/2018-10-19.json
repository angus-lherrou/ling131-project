I set up to ...\nDo you call yourself a dissident yeah yeah yes and ... ... did not call themselves a dissident\nDemo controversy if fuel is this war and we talked about it he said this war it's certainly history because people inside the country they believe if you're on dissidents or if you are opposing the good part of me\nThat I mean you are aspiring when you're on the bottom and you are trying to tell what other social model a void explores\nThe Washington Post published ... g's final column today the posts went up in English and Arabic do you know whether it's getting red in Saudi Arabia\nYes that have lots of websites which has blocked in Saudi Arabia on April ... building proxies to open this things on war for people it's become more popular if the government attack them about Dillingham into one day it's a it's\nWell when I talk nobody really what if the government that is to me everyone would read it on there that lets you know everyone what jobs are job hundreds you know\nYoung Sunni fled Saudi Arabia he now lives in exile in London where he founded and directs the human rights group out coached\nYour thank you very much for speaking with us and given what she did an update now on a case that also touches on issues of freedom of expression you may recall the name Laura ...\nShe's a University of Florida graduate who was accepted into a master's program at Hebrew University in Israel I'll go some was granted a student visa to travel there but when she landed in Tel Aviv two weeks ago Israeli authorities revoked her visa\nAnd barred from entering the country\nReporter Daniel ... has been following the store and she joins us now so there's news on al ... case today Daniel what happened\n[noise] well the news is that the Supreme Court and Israel rural that her student fees that should not have been revoked and she is now being released and her lawyer is on the way to the airport to pick her up\nSo take us back and remind us what the dilemma was for Israel in for Laura ... who is she in what it is really special detain or upon her arrival\nAt the heart of this issue Marco is that Israel passed a law and twenty Seventeen\nThat allows it to bar entry to foreigners who are involved and calling for a\nBoycott Israel and so it's real estate lawyers said that al ... father is of Palestinian descent and that she was the president of students for justice and Palestine a pro Palestinian group while she was at the University of Florida and she presents an ongoing risk of calling for a boycott while in the country\nAnd until now the lower courts have sided with the state lawyers but her lawyers said that she hasn't been active in that group for more than a year she's also said that she wouldn't support a boycott while she's in Israel\n[noise] so how does the kind of dominating conservative political class in Israel see the judge's ruling\nThe Hebrew University supported borrowed costs and an even sent their lawyer to bakar up but education minister Naftali Bennett he's from the\nFar right the Jewish Home party he said that that was an improper move by the university and when I was at the court case last week in Tel Aviv I asked ... Israelis in the neighborhood what they thought of al ... case and they\nSaid you know if she doesn't like this country she doesn't need to come but there are definitely other people who I've heard say this does not look good for a country that calls itself a democracy and as opposed to the hearing that I attended in Tel Aviv at this hearing judges seemed to be there\nAuthorities were interpreting this two thousand Seventeen\nLaw [noise] so now Laura al ... is free to go to classes at Hebrew University any sense of what her life is going to be like when she gets or is she going to face pressure not to get involved in activism\nEarlier this week some students put an empty chair in class thing is is reserved for them and they wrote it also an Arabic and then that's fine with they faced by right wing ears so you can see that her presence in Hebrew University is definitely going to raise questions but she's also\nAnd any program for human rights and transitional justice her fellow classmates are going to be dealing with questions around that very issue that she challenged\nAnd so I'm sure it'll be a ... year it's plenty of academic and non academic thing to discuss\nDaniel ... thanks very much for your time thinking Marco [noise]\nLong range so did you move on and what he is still haunted by nightmares\nMr Jong couldn't even hold himself up by the end of those ... months his weight trout from a hundred and sixty five pounds to about eighty\nIt turned out someone had accused Mr Jong of being a spy he eventually made a false confession just to get the torture to stop then Mr John was transferred to yo the prison camp heavily guarded labor calling me with about forty six thousand political prisoners including children [noise]\nAt your ducked prison camps\nArmed guards four sisters young too hard labor for sixteen hours a day seven days a week [noise] the winters are so cold the dead bodies of other prisoners would freeze into what he calls big jelly blocks of flash and Mr John would have to break them apart with a shovel and bury them as part of his job\nAnd go and do you look at and we want that has solution and was treated like when the animal and concentration camp [noise]\nYears later and two thousand three the government decided that Mr John was actually in a sense and they released in front of the president's half [noise]\nBut he found that his house had been seized and that has family is gone [noise]\nMr Jones friends had already help them flee to China [noise]\nMr Jong by a Chinese cell phone on the black market one that the government couldn't monitor and he managed to track down his family\nJust twelve days after leaving the prison camp Mr Jones snuck across the border into China by swimming across the two men river he reunited with his family and together they cross through Southeast Asia with the help of Christian missionaries\nAnd when I asked him about it he almost seems to block it out [noise]\nThem move you\nKnow there are just fully focused on surviving and making it safely to South Korea\nThere's there's nothing he could really\nRemember it's not like the coup spicy or the other thing [noise]\nIt's been fourteen years since Mr Jong made it to South Korea fourteen years of rebuilding its life but never forgetting the people he left behind his friends neighbors fellow prisoners even family Mr John has a younger brother and North Korea who calls him about once a month using a burn or cell phone\n\nSo let's get back to the car with Mr Jones and the focus of the day we sending food and USB drives follow forbid and media to North Korea is all just dirt path from here to the shore and you really can't say anything it's always because\nThere's always somebody who was one of them than\nWe ever I finally [noise]\nAfter two hours of driving we've crossed over a bridge to an island just eight miles across the water from North Korea [noise]\nBreath the shore and there and on packaging the bags like right it's in Bible\nWhere men everything else\n[noise] to ... inches away from the water [noise] some groups like no chain send goods to North Korea using drones are balloons or even smugglers on the border of China Mr John's latest send over strategy is a little difference\nHe sends the packages in the water he waits for the lowest possible tied which happens twice a month and then let's the currents carry the packages to North Korea [noise]\nThe packages are waterproof the rice and us bees are in recycled to lead our water bottles they're stuffing bibles donated by a church and just sealed plastic bags and then taping them to decide for those bottles [noise]\nEight cents to North Korea as often supplied by Christian churches and missionaries are also known to get involved with North Korean human rights they even funded an entire technology University in North Korea [noise] today\nFifteen hundred pounds of rice four hundred USB thumb drive four hundred parasite treatments two hundred bibles and hundred and fifty US dollars once the tide is at its lowest [noise]\nThere were only the bottles of price and other goods into the water and you're starting to see them slow\nDown the current towards North Korea [noise]\nAnd about six hours to packages will reach North Korea and they'll probably be picked up by young soldiers men who are often under fed and forced into their job Mr Jong is okay with that\nHe hopes the U.S bees will be passed along so that each one can have an impact on multiple people\nSome North Koreans the wealthier one\nDo have computers smartphones that the government has the power to monitor them very closely [noise]\nA lot of North Korean devices can automatically detect foreign media files and stop them from opening in some cases devices even delete them North Korean phones are also now into automatically take screen shots and police can ask to see them whenever they want [noise]\nAt least one big name has taken an interest in Mr junk\nWhere we have a very special group of people with us today user escape bees from North Korea\nOn January second two thousand Eighteen President Trump invited Mr Jong and other North Korean defector to the White House to talk about North Korea's human rights abuses\nI thought through our really fabulous interpreter we could probably go through a couple of the shores 'cause they're incredible and very inspirational\nMr John was the second person to share his story yes go\nAhead [noise] the lawyer who to call my\nIs also Britain's prison in North Korea of political reasons I Lived there for three years to to go on to\nMr Jones goes on to describe his work with no chain he also tells Trump the he was moved by his speech he gave at the south Korean national\nAssembly three months earlier he translated Trump's speech and included an an ascended over\nNorth Korea Vancouver much hope would help them and let me think about it that was great\nJune months after this meeting President Trump had his big summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong un Mr ...\nBut those are two of them were\nHe doesn't really understand why people would say a Kim Jong un is more like a messenger for peace he rather thinks that he is a ... with a smile on his face he killed his own brother\nHe assassinated his brother and also he killed one of the relatives so he is the person who doesn't really treat the people\nIn the way they should be\nTrump's claims he mentioned human rights during the summer but there's no public record of what you said Mr Jong wants to be helpful but he's not convinced that the summit will have any real effect on the still unfolding tragedy of North Korea he called it political theater last\nQuestion Mr John do you think you'll do this work for the rest of your life and what are you hoping for in the future [noise]\nChris a e do chain ... to ...\nI should go on now is that if we got to go through the [noise] the\nUm you know he at some point he wanted to give up but now he feels like he has a sense of responsibility in in a sense of duty to make this work especially considering that there's still people and friends back in North Korea in concentration camps and\nHe was the only one who got releases and also he fills not put up some kinds of responsibility\nTo make you make it more for the rest of them\nI can barely hear the last thing
