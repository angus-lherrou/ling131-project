GBH radio\n\nI'm Mark a worm and misses the world we been talking immigration and free speech today to things our next guest a Chinese dissident artists I weigh has also been talking about as he prepares to move back to a city he wants called home New York\nThe reality is about how you as a nation still have a power to accept the difference still have an allergy or do young enough to pick the challenge and have a vision and a and a half of the big heart\nBut what does that American Heart grow smaller asks I way way\nWe'll get to that in a few minutes I weigh ... name became well known here in the west after he was targeted by the Chinese government for his activism before that he was working in relative obscurity in Beijing in the mid nineties and for some years in New York City I look back on those years now as an important season in his life\nIf you talk about the winter then you come to spring here ... summer more and more pressures of time\nHis new book capture some of those times it's called I weigh Beijing photographs Nineteen Ninety three to two thousand three\nIn several photos he documents the final days of his father I Ching one of China's fine as modern poets and an artist who like his son felt the wrath of Chinese authorities after he passed away I feel\nYou feel you're alone and they don't belong to\nAnd maybe that's the moment that you want to act so that's really a psychologically prepared ration for me to become a new both of them is self a new boss of yourself yes this is like the godfather fail\nSo I'd like you if you would tell us a story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because the Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that offense should really unfold right yes is this the communist society Irish and have a\nClear hierarchy you know so he was a kick out from a Communist Party\nAnd even he was the same generation is on the state leaders chairman mall drawing an eye on those people\nThat work together but uh but he was heavily criticized us or right is in some way against the party so your father was in that inner circle with now oh yeah yeah they're really core which is supported the ruble ocean\nOr part of their own ... by the late ... of course he'd being kicked it on a from a party has untied revolution and uh spend about Twenty years so yeah I ... nuts\nAllowed to ride towards his name's totally disappeared in the public so the memorial how did that memorial first they decide that his body has to be covered by communist flack\nIs very high on there\nAnd that means you're you're part of it is a\nRevolution but I feel ... uncomfortable you know I said you know you should not do something to somebody already passed away which is made against his will so I made that argument that says we don't need covers out a flag\nDid they resist ... yeah they they told me they said you'll find that doesn't just been on the family\nWhich is very good argument they say I recently announced to the Communist Party or state was it a convincing argument though no it's not as a ... is ... to some mind now and has suffered so much\nThat they are being covered by that piece of read but I think it was this a Hummer and a cause that sickle said cool yeah I'm right if I mean it's brutal [noise]\nHurts me and then there were the flowers flower as in this kind of ...\nThat of a paper flowers you know if someone you spend the next\nDay a week later somebody dies the oh ya ya at the same\nI I Will walk in the room I feel no no no we\nDon't need to use and isn't being used before so they say why they're going to do after that we'll buy fresh ours my father's point his art has seen the he he lived for a civil much relate to the highest as static document on moral judgment\nSo I said I have to change it\nSo we send out a A R people bought all the ... forest in Beijing city wow I never made a fresh for bad so he can sleep or in the middle but still covered by this ride blanket\nWhile your father was ill you did this performance I that's all I can call it a you intentionally smash teaching dynasty porcelain and a ... dynasty earn and you were photographed smashing another are and how did these ideas come to you especially well your father was was dying\nNot really much ideas is really attitude or some kind of a stupid ridiculous uh action you see how do that kind of ... and all the time\nWas your intention to shake up the Chinese public know was not\nPossible you'll have no path for the rest of society is in deep sleep and they don't care\nIt was interesting something you said about smashing the vows you felt it was almost like a child acting out and I want to ask you about the middle finger because it's a photographic motif that you've used pointing a finger\nAt the Hong Kong's skyline appointing her middle finger at the Eiffel Tower Chairman Mao I felt like when I saw this it's like a rebellious teenager has just gotten a camera for the first time what is up with the finger is just so sad that survey\n... now I realize that don't do that anymore because I'm a\nGirl older you know and the U.S individual in this society what else do I mean it's just give out opinions\nSo you spent a lot of time in the United states do you feel you can still count on the U.S to be kind of the beacon of free expression around the world\nI don't race sinks outweigh you know on the surface things on the shallow surveys yes us are defending individual rights are human rights but deeply us also costs and a lot\nFor other nations for broader human rights violations\nI mean I asked partly because you live in Berlin now but I understand you're moving to New York with your family right yes so I Know you've described to us as a country of immigrants which I think a lot of people would agree with but president Donald Trump seems to reject that idea how do you feel about this reality as you were removed to the same with the reality\nIs about how you as a nation still have a power to accept the difference still have an allergy or\nJew young enough to pick the challenge and have a vision and a and a half of the big heart so if they don't then it will push people way they'll blame other people a day it just shows the with kindness\nAnd if that big heart starts to shrink while you're here you're going to turn your eye and your critique toward the United states or at least make your critics in your art of China more universal and maybe I'm to the u._s.\nI always protect the basic rights of freedom of speech and a human rights I don't see that the only as a Chinese problem is universal problem\nI weigh ... thank you very much for your time it was an honor and a great pleasure to meet you thank you nice to be

like it it's made out of material from finds that used to grow at\nThat time and the remains of dead animals are in the soil to not fossilized Bones Are petrified wood to actual stuff\nAnd all of this organic material has a lot of carbon in it in fact that's what the word organic means organic chemistry is carbon chemistry so ... says the soil has a lot of dead plants in it she means we put our carbon in the freezer\nYeah we have and now we're unfortunately kind of taking the plug out of the freezer and start she saw and so then one\nFrom a frost starts to truly thought than than carbon just kind of comes like how does the carbon get from down there to up into the atmosphere um because migrants are eating it and they are aspiring so they are briefing\nBasically and then they emit carbon so it's a micro breath that we have to worry about [laughter] basically [laughter]\n[noise] microbes when living things die microbes begin breaking them down and the carbon that was locked up and a blade of grass or the horn upper basin gets liberated and floats up into the atmosphere as methane or carbon dioxide\nFreezing slows microbes down but it doesn't kill them signed speeds them

summer long and this is all just to understand how much methane is coming off this one small area this year under these particular condition\nGroups of scientists are at work around the Arctic studying sites that are wetter or dryer colder or warmers with more or less vegetation and they're all trying to understand just how quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nI think the scary part is that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon stored hearing that from a ... we're trying to actively to figure that out [noise]\nYour team says it's hard to accurately assess greenhouse emissions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex\nBut it's also hard because humans have never won the planet up like we are now we have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective we're in what climate scientists call a new analog situation a massive global experiment\nIs not that we turn on the big Arctic permafrost machine or we don't know what it does [noise] um and until we actually figure out what it does maybe you could do to stop turning out [noise] [noise]\nIf you have the warming of one degree that makes all the difference in the world because it gets from frozen to thought and that is something that scientists are really worried about because many ah thresholds that he might cross their uh\nSays that in many parts of the Arctic permafrost has already thought enough to start emitting carbon in other places the frozen soil is right on the cusp of that pay the point where a change of one or two degrees\nStores carbon to something that ...\nWe might tip the scales of these really large exchanges then it can have really traumatic consequence is\nIt's not about saving the

gets much warmer\nAct the way that we have evolved with our agriculture and how we like the food that we eat\nAnd where we live it's just not adapted to it [noise]\nWe don't know how close we are to a massive release of carbon from frozen Arctic soils but we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point\nScientists call it a positive feedback loop more carbon in the air leads to more warming which leads to the release of more carbon in the process just builds on itself\nAnother thing we know is that we don't get a second chance at this once our emissions potentially trigger this huge release of carbon we've put ourselves at the mercy of processes that we can't control and that will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and her own civilizations\nI ask your team if he thought there was any way to stop this experiment we're conducting on the Arctic or if he thought the damage was already done and now we just have to ride it out [noise]\nNo we have an ability to stop [noise] of course we do we have choices [noise] I think especially in the western world in which we have choices and therefore we have responsibility [noise] um [noise]\nAnd [noise] one of the ways is to try and understand his experiment better and that's my that's what we do here and the other part is acting on what we already know which is start putting so
