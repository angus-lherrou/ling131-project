Concord New Hampshire\nSo\nWe have photos of severe was you're going door to door on the campaign trail to come out on our Instagram we are\nAnd what did they actually doing they're like what is a normal day of re education at a weaker home look like\nMost of the pond civilians that are coming into the homes are only staying for a period of a week two a month in some cases\nWhere they typically it looks like it's a lot of political events there's often flag raising ceremony you go out and you swear allegiance to the Communist Party there's a red songs singing patriotic songs singing activities there's films that people watch where they get patriotic education there is also cultural events that people participate in\nTheir drinking events basically testing to see if there's any reticence to doing this sort of thing because for a week or this is not um it's not comic activity\nAll of these things are tests of the loyalty of the week are subject to the Chinese state\nThey're trying to see how patriotic these people are willing they are to participate in hard cultural activities one of the things that the manuals that the ... billion to use one of the things that they advocate is that you ask the children because you'll get honest answers from the children concerning the agents as the parents\nDo the Han civilians who are in these homes they report on their host to like some higher authority [noise]\nYeah that's one of the primary goal of what they're doing it's a fact finding mission\nSo they have these manuals that they're using and those spots in these manuals that they fill out whatever activities they've been involved in if they've seen anything religious on the walls of the home that sort of thing they're making recommendations as to whether or not the rigors that they're spending time with our safe or unsafe whether or not they should be sent to the re education camps to get formal education\nReacting to this well many many years that I've spoken to have had ... on civilian staying in their homes have told me that they experience is pretty extreme form of a tournament them a kind of in ...\nThey feel like it's a violation of their personal space and up their family life there particularly concerned with the way that the ... civilians are treating their children their training their children to speak Chinese leader languages now something that's forbidden in schools\nThey might see their parents as backward which is what they're basically being taught by the state and we were parents feel as though they have no power to stop that sort of activity\n[noise] so how do harm civilians view their roles in his government project\nSo I found a variety of perspectives it's complex because there's hon people that live in this province who have lived there for decades those people that are from this older group many of them grew up with leaders in school in their neighborhoods from their perspective what's happening to the leaders is appalling\nMany of them talked about this as being something similar to the cultural revolution in the Nineteen sixties and seventies where populations were polarized and extreme way and all speech and action was politicized\nSo there's a lot of concern there from this older group the newer group of people that I met people that came to the province more recently are much more positive about the approach the state is taking they see it as something that needs to be done has essential\nOr many of these newer folks that I met were wearing lapel pins that had Xi Jinping's face on them or the Chinese flag they call each other comrades or sort of a patriotism fever among them\nAlso seemed as though they enjoyed dominating the spaces of leaders like in a restaurant for instance if there's a long wait for food they would demand that they'd be served first so it seemed as though they were taking up the position of the occupier or you know to conquer kind of enjoying the privilege that they now have there certainly are resonances\nEchoes with earlier projects to control unwanted populations\nThe way they train their final solution is lasting stability or long term security but it's quite big we don't know exactly what that looks like it seems as though they're thinking that the whole people for a generation\nEither in the camps or in tight surveillance and then maybe the next generation the young children that are going to these Chinese medium schools now that they'll be able to assimilate into mainstream society so their position is really quite fraught and precarious\nDarren ... is an anthropology professor at the University of Washington Thank you very much for being with us darn\nIt was my pleasure kinda feels like it's global campaign season right

they're legal residents they can vote in municipal elections but the majority choose not to it's a protest of Israel's annexation of their side of the city in Nineteen sixty seven Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state\nDevilish says he's gotten death threats and he believes Palestinian opponents tried to kidnap his three year old son do you think that was connected to the election\nApproach to the campaign he has no election posters because he's afraid other Palestinians will tear them down instead he speaks in private homes in mosques and on social media and tablet hired a religious Israeli campaign advisor to open doors in city hall\n... for me because I have a Marxist than it was a\nRecent Hebrew University poll found that fifty eight percent
