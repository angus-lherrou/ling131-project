Andrew with the world\nA moment of crisis those are the words secretary of state Mike Pompeo use today in Mexico city to describe what's happening with that caravan of migrants moving north from Central America\nProbably his message to Mexico and Central American nations stopped the migrants from reaching the U.S border President Trump has been tweeting the same message even threatening to close our southern border if the migrants make it that far\nThe group has grown in size to at least four thousand people mostly from Honduras right now many of them are in border towns in Guatemala trying to cross into Mexico\nReporter Emily Green has been on the road in Guatemala following their progress I'm Emily describe what four thousand migrants traveling together from Honduras Guatemala what is it seen look like\nAll over the last many days initially what I understand though is that all the migrants were traveling together but then it became so big so huge that it became incredibly dispersed\nI write to Guatemala yesterday and I made my way to a shelter and a city called ...\nWhat I was told us that roughly seven hundred hundred and had arrived yesterday and so the idea of a caravan as one might think of it is not really accurate it feels to me more like a mass of thousands of people traveling right now to the Mexico Guatemala border\nI mean it sounds just like a very long line of people as many as four thousand though I mean that that's pretty dramatic\nIt's completely a dramatic where I was last night was at a municipal sports center and it was like a basketball court was bleachers and there were just hundreds of people in it sleeping\nEating and it was loud and that kind of smelled of human sweat and what really stood out to me was just how many kids their work\nAnd I'm not just talking teenagers are ten year olds I'm Talking toddler stumbling around in their diapers\nSo it started with a lot of Hondurans um remind us where they're all coming from right now and and why they're leaving their countries\nI think that's still the vast majority of people are ... I Know that there are also of Salvadorans and I think watermelons are also joining\nAnd most of them say they are leaving because there's simply no opportunities and also just intense violence that affects their everyday lives I talked to a woman this morning who said her husband had been murdered three months ago and and her story is not unusual\nSo aside from the stories of violence what else are you hearing from some of the Margaret so I Know you've had the chance to speak with some of them\nWhat's really stood out to me is that this is not something that most of the migrants plans would they say to me is based on the news or they saw on Facebook that the caravan was passing and they said we're going to take this chance\nOr in the case of twelve year old Mario ... who I met on the road traveling alone he said he saw the caravan passing by and he decided to join his father's out of the picture on his mom is sick\nIts but oh I Know I got most of that coming up the until the cause of climate change for the military and still head on the world\nThe world is supported by as low business banking redesigned by entrepreneur is for entrepreneurs with digital tools to run your business including built in in voicing mobile deposits and online account set up learn more it as low A.

lot of people to your field you had to provide something for them to drink you didn't want to provide something too sweet [noise] because you need to drink a lot of liquids you're sweating a lot [noise]\nJust water sugar vinegar and ginger and it's about half as sweet as a soft drink or fruit juice so it doesn't really affect how you the sweetness but the vinegar gives you some electrolytes and give us some tiredness and the ginger hides the vinegar flavor for the last few like ginger it's it's a good I kind of like\nYou're listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations or service of W GBH radio\n\nI'm ... and you're with the world the story of what happened to the missing and presumed dead Saudi journalist ... continues to unfold\nHow it's been unfolding though that's what we want to focus on right now there's sometimes gruesome details in the case appear to be coming out in a deliberate slow drip courtesy of Turkish officials they're the ones who first put out the story that ... was brutally murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nTo learn more we got in touch with Carlotta Gall assembled bureau chief for the New York times so Howard took U.S officials getting their information and how are they parsing out what they know\nWell that's what's so interesting is I think they've known from the very get go I'm literally from the first day or evening um what happened was that the first week the Turkish\nOfficials I'm old anonymous ... not to be quoted started reaching out to the foreign media which was interesting because it's not usually what they do yeah so that then became a big story in the west and it was clear that that was that a him they wanted to be listened in the west they want it to be believed\nSo um it's been so they'd be they'd be cautious and careful with how they have released um what they know the details coming out drip drip I'm\nIn a way that has kept it in the news every day\nSo how much of a problem is it for journalists both foreign and Turkish to report the Turkish findings when the people in charge of the scene of the crime the Saudis are not really corroborating anything right now\nVery difficult I mean\nMr in many ways there's no full now that's coming out in the Turkish press which we can't completely dark ... one of the one of the things was that the record the audio recordings maybe came from his apple watch\nThat was quite quickly shut down by technical X but I'm the photos that were released of the Fifteen Saudis who are being accused of being the scored who flew in the sense that day and flew out that day we had teams in Neal and they were checking ... to try and match them with\nOpen source materials social media and stuff and so on we found\nPeople who are easily recognizable from you know the entourage of uh the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman they caught on [noise] um you know photograph news agency photograph so those are the things we able to match up there are others that it's difficult\nTo walk out who they are all\nThese leaks ah have gotten a lot of attention in part because the killing is a reporter to be hideous and a ... he was tortured some are going to see this as a threat not something that went to arrive in your reporting have you come close to understanding this [noise]\nUm no not yet I mean I think that for us we need to find what exactly happened and then perhaps we move on to why and why in this way but [noise]\nYou know this wasn't a a a shooting in a dark alley um that could be pinned on no one this is a very brazen attack and so I think the talks have been tucked that as a threat against them against our own government and\nPresident out on himself so that's why that particularly in range I think\nAnd so now people are looking at the relations between turkey and Saudi Arabia which although the sudden diplomatic deference they do have differences considerable difference it\nAnd so now you see in the pro government columnists quite a lot of anger spelling out a victory and demands that um the crown prince be removed so it's it's gone going very high\nCarlotta Gall the New York times bureau chief and assemble thanks very much for being with us pleasure to meet with the\n[noise] [noise] Mm\n[noise]\nMichael is gone but the recovery is just beginning Michael tore through the south east us last week a powerful\nThe climate change among the places that took a direct hit ... air force base in Florida to do just one of many us bases around the world that are vulnerable to be growing impacts of climate change but as the world's Carolyn Beeler reports the military is not tracking those costs\n[noise]\nBeing ripped off a building that single air force base and swung through the air in ... like ... [noise] the wind also smashed buildings in piles of lumber and flipped over ... it's for roofs off of airplane hangar\nAnd damaged esque twenty two stealth fighter jets worth more than three hundred million dollars each\nMore than a week later officials are still surveying the damage but when they're done the repair costs will not be added to any running tally of military spending related to extreme weather or climate change because that doesn't exist\nI think it is fair to say that the military does not know what the costs of climate change will be going forward\nThat's John konger he oversaw environmental policy and managed facilities for the department of defense during the Obama administration last year the government Accountability Office recommended that the military start tracking the cost of extreme weather and climate change and all their installations ... wrote that recommendation for the watchdog agency\nWe think it's important to capture the distinction between a normal maintenance repair versus the closer College of a severe storms so that it helps to guide future adaptation projects\nLook argues it's a lot easier to justify the cost of an adaptation project like strengthening a hang roof if you know how much you've spent repairing hangar roots in the past and how much more you might spend in the face of increasingly intense storms and he points out it's not just about the money\nWe have military bases to support a military mission and if the base is out of commission by definition if not supporting the military mission\nThe department of defense responded to the watchdog agencies call to track climate and extreme weather class by saying no thanks actually they did say a little more they responded that quote associating a single event to climate change is difficult and does not war at that time and money expended in doing so\nFour or five years ago that was correct\nTrevor Hauser is with the economic research company rodeo group\nThe science was not yet at a point where that kind of attribution was possible\nWe can do it scientists still don't usually say a specific drought or hurricane was caused by climate change but they can say for example that an individual drought was twice as likely because of climate change or that Fifteen Percent more Maine's out during the hurricane\nCombining that new science with big economic data lets people like Hauser estimate how much climate change will cost investors insurance companies and government agencies\nRight down to a building level to estimate how much more likely it is at a given building a experience as extreme weather events now than it was Thirty years ago and how much more likely it will be in the future and what the price tag of\nFiguring out how much damage climate change is currently costing the military nearly five thousand sites around the world wouldn't be cheap but Hauser says it'd be totally doable\nI mean I don't know exactly what it would cost but I'm guessing it would cost them wash then you\nKnow half of a wing of wind sixteen fighter\nA department of defense spokesperson told the world they plan and design facilities to address whether an environmental conditions but climate change planning doesn't have a specific budget line however they say they're currently reviewing their climate resilience policies for the world that Carolyn Beeler\n[noise]\nFamilies would also required to pay two hundred and ten years per child each quarter for the school bus\nAnd many obviously looking forward to do so with ... migrants who sometimes don't have a job how can afford two hundred and ten years\n[noise] so what does this mean for immigrant kids like what were the eating at lunch and how do they go to school and how did they get home\n[noise] the thing is that before signing a low the first thing a ... he's trying to figure out the consequence of that resolution\nAnd convenes they were totally aware migrant children with being forced to eat separately from their classmates\nThat was his older load that prevents Keats from bringing their own food from home inside that class obviously was a problem for their parents because they were forced to take their kids to school in the morning\nThan some of them were taking their kids back home for lunch and then sending them back so they had to do that come forward from the house to school like three or four times a day to provide their keys some food\nHow have Italians been reacting to this\nThere was a reporter for ... for many ... TV program for first report to the case and they went to low income from that some of the seats and slow the asking them what do you think of the ... and you know well they were pretty ...\n... but things were different you know after a few days when the news got huge need ally and as I say at first ... supported the residue should but then when he figured it out that a massive cruel finding to help the migrant Keith ready to raise\nSixty thousand euros you said that a ... of assets that being an off to go out on the school meals\nThere was one left wing politician in Italy called this resolution apartheid ah how many Italians feel that way\n[noise] [noise] yes there is a vision is being described as an op are tied as a form of segregation or that he's the feeling that we are going seriously to fire the\nPink ... are now studying just seeing that you know this is probably the most far right governments in the end of the world war second anybody for sure and maybe in ...\nYou know for kids it's never easy arriving at a new school and then you face these regulations that alienated from other classmates have you spoken with immigrant families and did they tell you how their kids are dealing with this\n[noise] I did speak to a mother you know do the she came from Tunisia and she was telling me that she fell you mediated she felt you know she was angry she was the seriously you know disappointed and humiliated by\nLow crime by politicians were pulled totally aware of the ... ... migrants in lowly\nSo they felt the was injustice and it's very hard for them to express their anger and frustration because often they are invisible any of the\nInterior minister Mattel solving supported this resolution but then backtracked as I said has the mayor of ... also backtracked no she didn't\nKnow she didn't she say that she will concede or a so suffocation ... says as a way to guarantee school meals the kids but she said that she was never drove the resolution\nGuardian reporter Lorenzo tone to thank you thank you\nSpeaking of things that sound wrong imagine a TV show like cops but for ice as an immigration and Customs Enforcement you know show would follow ice agents around as they conduct raise looking for suspected undocumented immigrants\nAnd the purpose of this t._v. show uh sensibly entertainment you may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson his\nNews ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality talk show\nIn this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess he's over stairs or people who are working against the terms of of their their views in Japan and they stake out people you're there with them in the car\nUm they they capture them interrogate them and then um as the title of the show suggest or deport it on the next plane type thing\nWow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or translation and English\nIn Japanese it's called ... which I guess translate says Koch at the moment of deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show it uh in Japan called a Tylenol ... which is like caught at the moment of harassed sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada Ryan from for example uh we had a show like this that kind of the border services agency collaborated with with the producers and actually the Kenyan government help funded and so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless\nAnd it was only taken off the air because of the uh the contravene privacy regulations Canada\nWhat is the tone of the the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very leery and breathless um when you eat you basically have a a Japanese person um ... what's happening it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and in Brighton pleasant so now the the immigration agents are on their way to the\nThe dormitory word some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of of of hiding out in a minute sort of narrative and say it's a very um\nYou know cinema verite say you're you're with their with them in the car there's a camera you know you're driving down the road it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also has very stringent privacy regulations\nYou can't really show anybody's face so everything is word out including the like the neighborhood where it is because like like say if you show the neighborhood\nOr the people who live there would probably complain in ... create a flash and so it's just like this is like an hour and a half of what worry blurt out\nImages you can't see people's faces and voices are describes is quite an odd courtroom\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is that a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be um because uh the the program\nThe Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl so they leave I mean there's people who put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to immigration agency and get more resources I'd assumed is going to be some work PR efforts like this too\nI gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan what have active it's been saying\nWell I mean yeah I like on line there is considerable backlash from anti racism activists who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant anti racism a movement and so yeah they they basically said why are you trying to introduce entertainment like why why are you showing people being deported\nHow can this be entertainment and then um the the mainstream media picked it up so it varies newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot in front of 'cause I mean like the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstayed their work permits\nWell I mean I guess it'd be the obvious appeal is racism ... people I suppose have biases about people from other countries the uh they don't speak our language or they look a bit different and\nAnd they're coming over here and taking our jobs type thing so I I but personally I I'm not sure like uh I think it's just kind of a ... sensational kind of a cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended it by getting samples all over the place that they have a a catchy theme tenet everybody's not singing [laughter] yeah\nI mean I I guess you might think also we live in a time when around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because of a say for example Donald Trump for\nBrexit or invasion of Crimea so maybe people are just feeling I'm less secure in their own country and so perhaps these sorts of shows provide some reassurance that someone's doing something to protect us here\nNevin Tom Cindy Japan editor for global voices thank you very much for telling us about this a
