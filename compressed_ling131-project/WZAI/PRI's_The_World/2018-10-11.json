... for the independent he joins us from Istanbul so let's start with the information published in the Turkish newspaper ... walk us through what they say happen ...\nAll over the Turkish media essentially they're saying that a team of Fifteen people arrive from Riyadh the Saudi capital onto private airplanes from a company close to the Saudi leadership just hours before Jim office Yogi was to show up at the consulate for routine paperwork\nAnd that this team showed up at the consulate just before he came in and then left in a black van and other vehicles\nTwo hours after he arrived and

you talk about intelligence operations and climate sting operations and so on you're not going to get a standard of proof that might hold up in a U.S court but as far as we're concerned watching the

judged for the actions of a man he never knew\nOur lives never overlaps he died sixteen years before I was born so what I Do know about him I Know through reading about it from the same materials you have access to so I can only speak about it from a historical standpoint there's no personal connection time and space wouldn't allow it\nAnd so you know what I Do know about his alleged activities I condemn outright false horribly with no equipment Keisha\nBut that hasn't stopped Duncan Hunter the incumbent Republican congressmen and companies jars opponent from using company's jars family history as a political club like in this campaign spot\nHallmark jars working to infiltrate Congress three different names to hide his family's ties to terrorism masterminded the Olympic massive whose

quarter of a million dollars in campaign funds on personal expenses like a vacation to Italy family dental bills and video games\n... says voter outrage should be focused not on his background and family but I'm hunters alleged crimes you lost his\nWay and Washington and I think there was a a kind of a a slippery slope that he went on it turned to self interest and now it's leading to self destruction\nAccomplish are also says he wants to keep his campaign positive his platform emphasizes affordable health care bill ... training and clean energy reserves were worse when he talks to voters companies are emphasizes need to get beyond today's tried to call it checks\nFor all of us\nFrom Jason raised a military veteran who often votes Republican likes what she hears from companies are even no policy wise\nI'm not a hundred percent in agreement with everything [noise] um I think he's got to be a character and I think he means the best for America and for this district and so he's got my vote\nBut until hunters indictment ... campaign was considered a long shot and even in the wake up in the indictment hunters still leads in the polls but companies are is counting unsteady demographic\nGrowing Latino in Arab American population\nIs the biggest county in so Christian Iraq account of population outside of Michigan in Iraq it's thirty five percent Latino we're sitting in a place where as I can do to were thirty percent of all the voters love and it's a majority minority city and and\nYou think because of those changes more receptive yeah you and your ... and in the last few weeks of campaigning companies are says he's ready for political dirty tricks that try to use his heritage and family's past against him here's the thing\nI didn't wake up and become Latina Arab American when I started running so all the all the intrigued that comes with that and all like the trials and tribes that come with having a diverse background [noise] and the opportunity and challenges of that I've carried my whole life\nFor the world Saul Gonzalez San Diego\nUSA Today published an opinion piece pen by President Trump today Trump attacked the plans of some Democrats to expand Medicare to include everyone Trump called that socialism here's a quote\nThe new Democrats are radical socialist who want to model America's economy after Venezuela which got us wondering about the word socialism and how politicians use it\nPatrick Cox's here he reports on language for us\nSo people in the right Patrick I Belong to attack their opponents for being socialists what's different than how Trump use the word today\nWas funny you know this in a way there's nothing different from what people have been saying for decades about socialism like basically it was just a stand and foot communism right\nNow though some elected politicians on the left or right she embracing socialism you think of bunny son does New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio Cortez they identify as social or what a socialist means\nFor democratic socialist down their value for me that I Believe that in modern\nAnd welfare society now for the last [noise]\nPretty Sanders a court says they use the term democratic socialist what what does that tell us like because it kind of a branding their socialism away from Marcus revolution and communism as you were saying\nYeah I think that's what they're trying to argue and it's weird because if somebody like me who grew up in Europe it really isn't a stretch I you know I'm used to hearing about political parties during the Cold War who called himself socialist or at least they openly supported social as funny as\nAnd nobody was espousing mocks his revolution I Know that wasn't the case here in the U.S if you were a socialist you might as well\nThere was a political said right yeah right I mean even the white Trump used the word today kind of has its genetics and the red scare and the Nineteen fifties in the McCarthy which ... so what kind of support the socialism or democratic socialism if they call it that what kind of support does it happen to us right now\nWell I think we'll get some clues from the results in the midterms\nBut there are other indications too I mean for one thing you have people on the right attacking socialism formal frequently than they used to the idea of socialism has become very popular among young people like Ben Shapiro who's a relatively young conservative commentator he was barely alive when the Berlin Wall came down\nAnd they frame socialism as you know the opposite of capitalism\nCapitalism is good because capitalism is freedom socialism his dad 'cause socialism is tyranny not an aspect of journey socialism itself is sharing\nAlso mark ... democratic socialist of America on the eve of Donald Trump's election them membership was less than ten thousands today it stands up more than fifty two thousand you know no big but it's growing\nYeah and that's interesting when you think about Trump singling out Venezuela it's the opposite trend where the Chevy Chase a socialist and pretty much all headed for the exits except for the loyal died in the little ones anyway
