there from Madrid [noise]\nUp un climate scientists say it's not too late to avoid the very worst effects of climate change though would take some truly historic and transformational change of the ways we live on the world\nTwo rows and lesser my family had a house in ...

conservatively\n[noise] they can just say oh there goes your advice of a chicken his family you know hide the fake and you're listening to the Cape and islands NPR station\nWe seemed go by and say okay for him he's a survey but we're not going to be [laughter] [noise]\n\nI'm ... and you're with the world\nThe difference between one and a half and two degrees Celsius doesn't seem like much but in terms of the global climate and how it impacts hundreds of millions of people around the world it means a whole lot\nScientists have been looking at how we might keep the warming of the planet to one point five degrees Celsius\nAnd researchers who just put out a new United Nations report on climate change say that goal it's still possible but limiting warming to one point five degrees Celsius or about three degrees Fahrenheit would require huge changes to transportation land use and urban infrastructure that are unprecedented in human history we\nReally need to start working very hard right from now if we're not going to see the auction slip away so the message is indeed a very strong\nThat was Jim ... from the un inter governmental panel on climate change which released the report the rules Carolyn Beeler here to tell us more about it uh this report found as possible to reach that one and a half degrees Celsius target but just how hard would it be well\nHard as you mentioned that reports authors hundreds of them wrote that for the inter governmental panel on climate change said there is quote no documented historic precedent for the scale of the economy wide changes we'd have to make to cut emissions enough to keep global warming to one point five degrees Celsius\nThat's because we'd have to cut carbon emissions roughly a half in roughly a decade and would actually have to reach net zero emissions in just Thirty years\nI just want to underline how hard that would be to do it\n... enough by twenty fifty that anything we met we can then sucked back out to the atmosphere by planting trees are taking other steps so that would be a huge undertaking\nYeah I mean people are already talking about how hard it is why Carolyn does this report focus exclusively on the differences between one and a half Celsius and to Celsius in other words this is the difference between about three degrees Fahrenheit versus three and a half degrees Fahrenheit\nBecause those are the two numbers that are written into the twenty Fifteen un climate change agreement so for a long time two degrees Celsius was sort of thought of as this kind of goal but in Paris at the un conference in twenty Fifteen\nLow lying island nations and really vulnerable countries like the Marshall Islands in Bangladesh banded together to push for this more ambitious target to be written into this global document so they got it in their Bangladeshi climate advisor ... we'll talk with one of the people working behind the scenes to get that more ambitious target written into that taxed\nAt that time it was more of a moral argument that we won't get disabled keep you on the planet and not just some people on the planet but what we have no is a very very sort of scientific assessment of how much damage seemed to me he's going to be to the whole world is just for people on the planet\nYou okay so what would two degrees Celsius due to the whole world\nThis report spells out some really significant differences even though one point five and two degrees don't sound like that far apart for example um ten and a half million more people would be impacted by sea level rise under two degrees and hundreds of millions more people would frequently face extreme heat waves\nA natural habitats would shrink for a lot more animals\nAnd coral reefs would be all but destroyed whereas under one point five degrees of warming some would still be around\nYou and twenty fifth is just around the corner so this is this is really sobering news um and like so much of what we hear about climate change kind of depressing where's the hoping this report\nWill I think people like ... in Bangladesh been pushing for this one point five degree target for a long time\nWould say they're happy that is still technically feasible to reach that and also that this report that so thoroughly documents the differences in real human experience between one point five degrees and two degrees will help focused even more on that more and dishes target\nWhich I'll do it would be very difficult to reach I think that increased focus would be seen as a positive by a lot of people\nThe world's Carolyn Beeler there the winners of this year's Nobel Prize in economics or to American scholars who make connection\nBoth the royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that William Nord house and Paul Romer were picked for their work on the most basic impressing economic issues of our age\nNord house as a pioneer in environmental economics he started warning policymakers in the Nineteen seventies that their economic models were failing to take the impact of climate change into account\nNew York university professor Paul Romer helped create the modern approach to understanding innovation and how it relates to economic growth\nHe joins us now from NYU Stern school of business uh first of all professor congratulations I have you had a chance to speak out with your fellow winner William nor does no\nI haven't I just wrote one of his nephew hoping that I could find out how to get in touch with Bill it's really a terrific honor to be linked together with him he's just a great scholar and accept suddenly decent guy couldn't ask for better association\nSo your work is linked to the work of Dr north house how would you describe your work\n[noise] we're both interested in\nNot the kind of trade off that's common and economics like we can use this field to produce a little more corn or a little more wheat what Bill and I were focused on is the huge gains that can come from discovering new things the real source of progress for humans\nAs in the discovery of new ideas that gives you more of both corn and wheat so that's a unifying element in what we do [noise] you know we have our own different specialization bill is really the one who's focusing explosively on climate change\nBut you know I'm very supportive at work and I firmly persuaded that the real key to addressing the ... of the energy system will be\nTechnological progress and the key to policy right now should be to encourage this amazing machines for discovery we have in the modern economy just encouraged apt to go tackle this very important problem\nSo it sounds like your body of research looks at that discovery of new things part of technology can you talk about how that overlaps with the work of Dr ... and ... with climate change\n[noise] there's a very simple model that would say something like oh the government supports basic scientific research I did giving grants to university professors than the private economy puts that knowledge to work\nProfessors love that story because it involves the government giving money to professor so you know they're they're keen on that but the truth is that most discovery and most learning\nTo fix problems and the academics often come along later and kind of clean up afterwards\nLike when people started working out how to use steam engines to do work it was much later that just came along and invented thermodynamics to figure out you know what the heck are these guys doing so it wasn't like the ... the invention Stephen\n... engines led to the ... there was a real advantage to creating incentives for start ups and firms to go out and try and make a business in this area\nAnd so I think both villain I Would recommend kind of attacks on say carbon based energy sources you need to use government policy to unleash this machine for discovering which is the modern accounting professor what's next for you\nI went to the world bank right after the vote on Brexit but it was the summer when he's sixteen\nYep yep that for me was a real red flag there were many things going on there were still trying to understand that part of what was going on or is there a lot of people who basically said if the economist or for or against it so it's a whole lot of people say if I don't know so far we're against it kind of us need to pay attention and figure out what we did wrong\nTo lose our authority is to people you could trust to get the facts [noise]\nNew York university professor Paul ... one of the winners of the Nobel memorial prize for economics

the rock is very offensive to the on the news cycle and let me know what you're saying so that comes from observing them on the clock as I talked to ... tourists at the base of ... there was this one sentiment expressed repeatedly\nA feeling that ... was an Australian treasure and they have a right as Australians to climate like this guy\nDoing a few structures because it's a hog farmer of member thing her\nGlenn from Melbourne who was doubled a touching his toes when I talk to him\nOr understand why the aboriginal people don't want people to claw about ah do get that but I'm all respect to the rest is older than them too so I'm happy to climate again and I wanted to do it\nCome now because of a recent decision by pox astray Leah any aboriginal owners to close over to climate in twenty Nineteen [noise] it's something average will owners have wanted for a long time and well Glenn and all the tourists might be upset pox Australia Steve Baldwin says they just don't realize what the rock me\nThis one line up and say what you've done by climbing on that side of the rock where you shouldn't as fuck harming over that sensitive thought it's the equivalent of ... over the Sistine Chapel or oh climbing over church\nThe decision to close over to climate was a big deal Bolton says\nI was in the room on that diet and uh there were people tease it was it was ...\nHe says it came down to data fewer than twenty percent of the tourists to pass through the entrance gate ... actually making the climb so closing the rock climbers wouldn't be so drastic he says there are plenty of other activities for tourists\nYou could hire recycling cycle around all the routes you can have a progressive dinner on a double decker bus or not\nYou get the picture and the local original

going slowly they're going to get the money\nSeems like you\nBut and there's money being made here around this all are rude just your community get much money from this from the old the tourism dollars that come here yeah someone running and running for [noise]\nSmith us the money the local aboriginal community receives is a share of the puck entrance fee about twenty dollars for three days past\nBut they say the real money is made up the result so why don't share some of those profits with the local traditional owners I pose that question to Eddie fried that ... percent of the
