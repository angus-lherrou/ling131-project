Ah yes ah so did the trouble goes way back by\nLeader and it's a separate\nInstance of it and it has nothing to do with the mythological creature\nThe French came up with a troll meaning to bomb casts about or to kind of scan for something or to slowly look for a thing and we borrowed that troll into English and we use it primarily or did in fishing where you\nYou dangle debate over the side and your boat slowly goes down the stream or across the lake and you try to attract fish to slowly moving bait and you bring them and that's troubling\nAnd so we fast forward to the Internet I'm very early on in the history of the Internet is big social phenomenon people started\nDoing what we now call trolling which is saying outrageous things\nSometimes that they didn't believe in order just to get a rise out of other people to get their\nGoats so to speak or just to bust\nTheir chops and missed trolling comes\nSpecifically from the fishing kind of trolling which is you throw something outrageous out there on the Internet and see who bite maybe it's going to be a newbie who doesn't know that you're a big jokester maybe it's going to be somebody on the other side of the political spectrum who you just know is going to be ... at the map this this thing that you've said that you don't even really believe in but\nObviously people know about the mythological shows a very soon people who do trolling which is comes from fishing were called trolls with the idea that they were\nUgly undesirable beef that are more causing all this mayhem and you didn't really want them around of that while yeah right [laughter] I think it was a man the language borrows words don't stay themselves they they transform they ...\nSimilar words a lot of times those meanings intersect and we borrow from both streamed in order to make a new stream\nWell that is absolutely fascinating\nI recognized the language static didn't expect that [laughter]\nYeah so the Internet trolling where you just say outrageous are dumb things on purpose in order to irritate her aggravate other people have to at least the early Nineteen nineties a lot of times people will credit\nOf the news group all folklore urban but I've actually found it earlier than it's ever was ever mentioned in that news group in other places in using that in in the news groups\nWhat what's wrong cable TV with some regularity\nYes well it's mainstream now I'm not surprised that you heard it on cable news or ... feet in the newspaper it's utterly mainstream because the Internet had mainstream and move we've been an Internet Society for going on Thirty years\nNow right and as you said the speaker of the house he used the term right it's it's striking to me that it goes from the fishing trolling idea\nBut also incorporates the that creepy guy under the bread yeah that's what I picture it when I have Internet trolls you know I think somebody coming out from the that dark nether regions\nWell there's this there's this enjoyable period there where they think this is important Harry to\nWhere the fishing trolling first became figurative and non fishing related in other ways\nBefore I arrived to the Internet idea of trolling so you can see people trolling for dates\n... going to the mall and trolling for trouble or trolling for information and there's another kind of correspondents here with the people that people often bring up which is trolling\nT.
