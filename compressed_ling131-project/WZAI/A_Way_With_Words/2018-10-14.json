words that we were ... ...\nOh you have a way with words Hi Hi who's this\nThis is Barbara Murray and I'm calling from Curtis by the the California\nHello Barbara next to talk to you Hi Barbara what's up high they detect you got to what can we do for you\nUm I have a question about it\nAnd I never heard anyone else use it and it got to be kind of a family joke so now when we use it only use it like in a in a\nJoking kind of way because we thought it was such a silly phrase so she would always say whenever she thought we were going someplace like I grew up in northern California in the bay area so like when we had to go over to San Francisco and she knew it was going to be crowded and she would be like oh I really don't want to go it's going to be a mob steep\nAnd so that was her favorite she would always call things that she didn't even know for sure but anything she thought was going to be crowded and she called it a mob scene and\nMy kids pick it up and it just became a family dog so now when we talk about going and they were like oh God should we go it's going to be a mob\nSee [laughter] why why not just because it's employed so often\nTo me it always sounded like I didn't know where she got the phrase I never heard anyone else say it and it like it sounds vaguely sinister but the way she said it didn't really sound scary that I always pictured like the scene in the old Frankenstein movie where the the crowd is storming the castle with flaming torches\n[laughter] pictures when she said mob scene so I just you know I wanted to know what was the real or agenda of the phrase due to other people use this did she make it up\nOh no it's been around for quite a while since since at least ah\nThe late Eighteen hundreds mob scene and it referred to kind of the kind of seen that you're talking about just it comes from the world of theater and a whole bunch of ... calling on stage you know they're big climactic crowd scenes yeah yeah ground lonely\nSomehow the the word mob makes it sound more horrible or bigger\nOne has developed nuances over the centuries since it first really popped into the English language it's been in contact with sometimes ... automatically imply violence or danger yeah\nYeah which which it was not in her case it was just me and she wasn't I Would not say that she wasn't any scientific says agoraphobia she just didn't like to go any place that was crowded mhm even though she's constantly had to and so she would just always use that phrase and like I said now it's a family joke\nI Love the word mob too because it comes from the Latin mobile a bogus which means the or the changeable\nCommon people the physical common people in the mobile okay like mobile it's related to mobile and move and the ...\nBut not vulnerable enough snow owners in common or ... yeah exactly say ... yeah so the ...\nVogue us was was the uh the common people to the crowd that would uh seeing ... one day in crucify him next\nOutlawed isn't necessarily bad it's just a whole lot of people\nThere and disorganized ... will you never called soldiers on parade a mob because they're in right wing and rose right\nRight they're very organized whereas a mob is just a bunch of people milling around right wing maybe\nPart of like my mother didn't like was just a whole ton of disorganized faithful\nAll right yeah I'm picturing all the extras in a in a movie scene or on your age you know saying peas and cares peas and carrots or whatever it is it they said to simulate crowd noise steamboats on ... [laughter]\nWell that's great I just you know as I said I have really never heard anyone else use it and I didn't know she had made it up or if it was a real thing and I just I Love that it's become a joke thing it's really one of those I rolling thing now\nYeah ... yeah so I think she would be happy to know or carry it on for her\nAnd now I'm going to think of her whenever I hear that term\nGet well my mom with a great person so great for the most part but thank you for your call we really appreciate it okay you have a great day by by\nWe've talked about this on the show before how words that are now ordinary were once condemned is horrible and mob was one of those words\nSo as early as Seventeen ten Jonathan Swift and other people described the word mob as terrible as a shortened form of Latin phrase and he said it's the result of a natural tendency towards relapsing it's about Barry which delights in ... syllables\nThis criticism of shortening words which is perfectly ordinary way to make new words in English at least three hundred years old and a long tradition of natural tendency towards relapsing him to the bar verity but it's not human condition [laughter]\nIf he had pearls he would have been clutching them right [laughter] eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three [noise]\n\n\nAnd from our business sponsors whose commitment to WC eyes work on the Cape the coast in the islands is shown through their financial contributions please take the time to let her sponsors know that you've noticed and appreciate their support [noise]\nBring 'em all from the radio this week reporter Chris ... talks about the peanut butter grandma Nineteen fifties Washington homemaker changed how the FDA regulates commercial foods she and she only takes ... to a bus station Tel Aviv or Filipino cuisine served we cook a bright in fragrant yellow occurring\nWe show you base it weighs a toaster spice coming up this week I'm no street radio from here today at noon on double UCA I\nHow we use it a grandparent and Martha burn it a while back we had a conversation with a young woman in Florida\nWho naturally use the expressions yes ma'am and no sir and some people thought that was a little strange a little affected but it was just the way that she taught right and that reminded during the Hickey from Austin, Texas\nAbout an experience that she had in ninth grade in ... Ohio which is about fifty miles outside of Cleveland she wrote to us\nI was a very quiet girl shy and slightly backward but I was smart and in what was then called advanced classes\nMy dad was in the military and we moved around a lot so I was really quiet and shy for that reason our home and family was Mississippi [noise] she goes on to talk about how one day early in the school year\nHer English teacher asked her a question and during the answered yes ma'am her teacher was indignant and said you do not said ma'am to me it is disrespectful do you understand\nEnter into automatically responded yes ma'am [laughter]\nAnd she goes on to say remember I'm from Mississippi and in that day not saying that could get you a wooden spoon to the back side we were born saying it before we said mama and daddy\nBut the teacher saw it as smart alec and in her defense sometimes kids would say yes ma'am or something like that sarcastically anyway her teacher ended up sending to rent it to the principal's office\nAnd she goes on I had never been there before I was embarrassed ashamed and mortified what had I done my first year and I'm In trouble two weeks into being there [noise]\nThe principal read the note listen to me talk and proceeded to tell me here in northeastern Ohio we speak standard English we do not slur our ours we do not stretch out our words we did not say certain things they are not correct\nI was sent home with a note from him to have my parents sign it and come have a talk he made arrangements for me to have speech therapy what I was mortified\nFortunately though she writes my parents fell out laughing I never did do therapy I graduated with high honors from that school system after changing schools two more times in the four years I didn't think it funny at the time but I can look back over fifty years later and laugh oh\n[laughter]\nI knew you would be not about function\nOf course there it doesn't require in February I was gonna say the same thing I Am not to the funny stage yet their wall [laughter] I Want to go to the marching on her behalf\nThe little girl me for her because she said yes man right or and she speaks with the Mississippi accent yeah right or hard oh I'm sure she's not the only person\nWith a story I notion that we get emails and calls about that yeah I\nGrew up speaking French in Maine and we're told the English speaking schools that they couldn't speak to people who had their hands smacked for speaking Spanish at the religious school um 'cause that's what they spoke at home but not at school yeah I just finished reading about code talkers the Navajo and\nUm they were forced to go to the English speaking schools where they were spanked if they spoke Navajo to hoping\nAttitudes are changing yeah during the thanks for sharing that story\nYeah just to underline a dialect isn't a thing to be corrected it's a thing to be cherished well said eight seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three email\nWords wavered radio dot org hello you have a way with words\nHi this is that ... I Am from Idaho and damn I had a question about the Basque language okay um I have a brother in law who bask\nAnd there I don't I I had the kind of drug into the whole Basque culture around guy to hell in Idaho has a very large ask community mhm and so um [noise] I find it pretty fascinating that language is\nI'm considered quite ancient ten uh is not related to any of the countries around I'm ah in Spain and France So I Wonder what your take was on it [noise]\nWell that's the best nutshell description I've heard of bask in a while [laughter] much yet it's what's known as a language I Phillips do you notice expression\nYes I I look that up yeah gotcha\nSo language ice lose one that is not connected directly to the languages around it and it is believed that back predates\nThe Indo European languages that as it was a language spoken before the people who brought all the Indo European languages into Europe before they arrived and earn a little bit about its history because there are few ah inscriptions on gravesites um a lot of the place means give us clues to it\nBut the strong evidence is that it is not directly connected to any of the romance languages although it did borrow from Latin\nWhich is other than maybe few words that have traveled from the dramatic languages into French and then in tobacco and things like that and so it's it's it's a very interesting thing it is about southern by about seven hundred thousand people give or take although almost all the speakers of bilingual and there are numerous dialects of it I think there's four major dialects of back\nAnd uh it's just a very interesting curiosity this remnants of another time and I'm not much is known about it and where it comes from although it's it's heavily studied because it's so interesting and so unconnected to the languages around it\nIt's a climactic helps at all say I heard that that people were somehow classic with the ... the Welsh her own Irish\nThere are some people who've tried to\nPropose that theory but it doesn't withstand scrutiny some people have looked at genetic similarities between certain bodies of people\nUm and things I found something they would again generally it falls apart there are superficial similarities between all languages in the world and what you need is a consistent similarity across multiple\nFeatures of the language for example where you would expect the verbs if one verb is similar between languages we expect many of the verbs to be similar between languages if there's one word for say a relationship term like father or mother who just expect many other relationship terms to be the same and it's just not the case so\nI Believe the evidence is because there is no connection to Welsh there is no connection to the Celtic languages um it's not related to corn issue it's not related to the other languages spoken in France that aren't French and and so forth\nOut yeah it is a very interesting very interesting on a lake Charles\nAnd the people themselves are very interesting with or or unless I'm Sarah trying to ... um he'll ever was ruling in Spain had bar people from speaking back\nYeah that's a really common story across cultures it's not just the Spain but even in France some of their regional languages were stumped out by this French need for to establish a nation state with a French identity that was built upon the language and centered on French just a common language so violent spoken and Brittany are all but gone\nUm it's unfortunate but I'm having the United states as well in Canada and Australia and that China it just happens pretty much anywhere where nations sees its identity is being firmly attached to one language they almost always put in a program of stopping out the other languages\nFast food is really good you have your relative treated you to any\nW ... members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a
