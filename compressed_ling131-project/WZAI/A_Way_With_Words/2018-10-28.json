way\nOkay All right you think you've got it you know they're both catch the now this one's kind of classic how was scotch tape like a walking cane they're both ... they're both sticky yes how was the

Alice Waters founder of shape and nice in her new memoir coming to my senses waters reveals the unexpected pass from counterculture activists to fire Montessori teacher\nAlso in this week's show ... guy author of black girl big coming up this week I'm no street radio from here today\nYou're listening to a way with words the show about language and how we use it I'm ... and Martha Barnett born\nIn London in Seventeen Seventy two Luke Howard was a shy chemist who was also really fascinated by weather and particularly by clouds he wants to organize how we understand and observe the ever changing formations up in the sky and he wanted to do it in a way that with scientific\nAnd Eighteen oh three he self published a pamphlet that he called on the modifications of clouds et cetera\nIn it he proposed the classification system for clouds in he drew on his school boy Latin and came up with the main categories which were serious strata and chew meal is not serious comes from the Latin for hair or temporal\nStrategist comes from the Latin for layer and cumulus is like a pile you know like accumulate\nAnd this new way of looking at clouds in these new names in this whole new language for talking about something that everybody it always seen but never really classify that way it hit a nerve in the popular imagination and Luke Howard became this reluctant scientific celebrity\nIsn't that Clinton was championed by some of the greatest minds of his time especially the influential German poet gr to go to win so far as to write poems based on those names\nAnd some people criticized Howard for using Latin rather than everyday spoken English and gr to wrote a passionate response or on Howard's behalf\nAnd he argued that those Latin cloud name should be accepted in all languages they should not be translated because in that way the first intention of the inventor and founder of them is destroyed and he even went on to send Howard gushing fan mail which is kinda hard to imagine today\nThe story of all of this is told by historian Richard hamblin in the book the invention of clouds how an amateur meteorologist forged the language of the skies and in fact if you go to his home in London\nThere's a historical marker that says Luke Howard name or of clouds lived and died here are all of them may clouds\nLittle we all remember when we come up with a word we won the acclaim recognition that knowledge right going to be part of history right and he got that her son is your fan yeah I Know dotting is I was a part of the letters are Howard\n[laughter] yeah forget the loud [laughter]\nThis I just thought some scientists came up with yeah these names but we still use them today yeah absolutely\nAnd they're not intact and other languages are they are modified to fit the different languages if they've\nBeen borrowed actually I don't know that there is it pretty clear system of classification of clouds and I don't know\nSo it's I like how it plugs into in the development of meteorology as a as a science where we started to realize that some of those old solids about the red sky or what I had a little bit of truth and we could look at the sky to see what was going to happen a little later with our weather\nExactly traced the sky with a painters fresh the wins around using little rash talking about serious clown\nYeah and what I also love about this is that it was a way of using language to impose order\nOn something that didn't seem to have any order it seems that Luke Howard was with someone who who saw differences in clouds and stop patterns and indeed um began meteorology that way\nI have often thought that if there were another species on this planet had the same kind of active intelligence as humans that they might actually call us a word that means the class of fires\nBecause that is so much of what humans do we sort organized we classify and if you were to think about our primary behavior a lot of it has to do with the things that we say things that we produce how we organize ourselves in our communities it's about\nSetting these boundaries and then this is a box and all of things of this type go in that box\nSeats right to classes fires I really liked that and of course the language is key to that right ... making sense of the world we love language and if you come across the patches that\nTalks about language in a way
