song for every single show now there's just way too much TV\nLucky for me though because that means that there have got to be shows that very few people have heard of over her example I'll give you an

from Indianapolis, Indiana\nWelcome to the show how can we help you\nPhrased that my grandmother you share a she grew up in North Carolina and she lets say crazy isn't that seems\nCrazy isn't bad see that [laughter] and how crazy that\nThing because it was never like if someone later laugh\nCrazy or something like that she would never use it in that way it was if somebody was doing something that she thought was stupid\nOh man she was saying that part of it is very few people [laughter]\n\nAnd I I haven't heard it much um I spent some time and when I was a child in North Carolina I heard it there but as far as north I've not heard it even from people who've come from the same region\nUh-huh and have you heard the term Betsy bug it all\nNow I Know I have no idea I Know I should I should look that up more but I have no idea what a bad [laughter]\n[noise] well we can tell what a bet she's I guess it's um it's a kind of be dull it also goes by the name patent leather beetle which kind of gives you an idea it's kinda as bad as big as your some and and black and shiny sometimes called the horned beetle\nBut it's also called abet sea bug or a best bug or a nasty bug\nAnd um you see the phrase crazy as Betsy bug or different variations of that uh throughout the south and nobody really knows why a bet she might might be considered crazy except it does make an interesting sand is kind of like it you know when you disturb it it makes it kind of\nDon't really like a little leg cat when you when it gets annoyed with you [laughter] know like\nThat kind of a you know kind of a fuzzy you they're pretty sizable and I'm In this beautiful black patent leather looking thing\nI guess that's why it's crazy because other bugs don't talk to you [laughter]\nYeah you don't really see them swarming I'd only seen them you know just wandering around kind of I don't know maybe maybe you're right I read is that [laughter]\nSo that's where it comes from and that's why I wanted that that's why I said it wasn't when she knew it was quite the opposite when she was just wonderful\nThey are going to do so but I was really letting your goal was\nTo thank you so much I'm so happy lives spoken with both of you\nOkay for work and I kept listening as well thanks a lot\nBut I actually hello you have a way with words\nHello this is Joseph from will from Wyoming\nHi Joseph welcome to the show how can we help you\nUnder par when it's used as a Gulf term under par as a desirable thing for states that you want to find yourself but in almost every other endeavor that I can think of being under our uh is not something you want to find yourself being\n[laughter] right right right All right so we can explain this there are two different\nScales here two different measuring scales\nAnd so what you need to remember is that each sport has its own way of considering something a really great score are really good score for example if you got to sixty nine in golf that's usually pretty good if he got a sixteen and basketball people that are not a very good game you get a sixty nine and baseball people are like they're tearing\nYour [laughter] I haven't done in another city [laughter] following a store [laughter]\nSo we're talking about different measuring skills for each part of life not just sports and golf has this really interesting thing where they start with an agreed upon number so let's say sixty nine and you go a little bit above or a little bit below but that number is considered standard are par the number that up professional\nProbably could reach on this course ... given sufficient time and expertise and\nAnd some experience on the court so so golf is a scale that's low to high\nAnd some with low being better and so many other things most of the rest of the things in life are the scale is high to low was hiding better and so it's just that court so we're still talking about part of being standard average or this\nThis police that we are going to compare ourselves against it just it stuff you need a low score and everything else almost you need a high score\nThat's interesting the sub par that we use in everyday life actually doesn't come from golf it's just golf borrowed its\nPower from regular English and the regular parties to standard usage of par or ... the number that you're going to try to beat and go above them so it's a path Joseph thank you for your call we really appreciate it thank you Bye bye already have a\nLanguage has its quirks but sports always just is extra nothing is more it's seems to go one more beyond ordinary and making them a language its own for each individual sport\nRight and adding to our language right and then and then cycling it back yeah I'm trying to get the feedback loop continues to go back into the mainstream language\nMongers ramble for milk street radio this week I chat with running low on the about Appalachia including pickle baloney in Chile bonds from Dixie pool\nAlso in this week's show mark ... traces the history of milk from ... to ice cream machine we also learn a new way to make custom\nComing up this week I mostly radio from here today at noon on WBAI [noise]\nTowards the show about language and how we use it our grandparents\nAnd Martha Burnett when's the last time you really listen to silence I've been thinking about that ever since reading a passage from a book by Paul Goodman called speaking in language here's what he has to say about silence\nNot speaking in speaking are both human ways of being in the world and there are kinds in grades the beach there's the dumb silence of slumber or apathy\nThis sober silence that goes with the solemn animals face the first will silence have awareness past hearing the sole wince emerge new thoughts the active silence of alert perception ready to save is this\nThe musical silence that accompanies absorbed activity\nThe silence of listening to another speak catching the drift in helping him be clear the noise the silence of resentment and sell for ... nation loud in sub vocal speech but cell in to say it\nBaffled silence\nThe silence of peaceful accord with other person's or communion with the cosmos\nAnd I was so struck by that passage I just keep thinking about it because it really lays out lots of different kinds of silence mhm and when do we ever get to hear silence to begin with\nDrew silence now yeah less noise right in the silent right I don't think we do one of the things that I have read about in the last couple of years is the parts of speech that are silent\nWhere we think of language is being but talking part of the language is also the part where we stopped talking is also the part where we leave a space for ourselves or for others to pick up the thread or to continue the conversation that silence is just as important as the audience is mhm\nYeah when I Do improv it's you know one has a compulsion to keep talking but sometimes the most powerful moments are when you're completely quiet\nYeah that compulsion to keep talking of the old cop and journalists strict right where you sit quiet for just a minute [laughter] to hurt or the interviewee is going to feel like they have to fill it in the right thing that they shouldn't have said\nRight the term for that in art is horror vacuuming\nA of a fear of of the vacuum you don't have to say that I appreciate silence I'm a guy who wears earplugs when I work and when I sleep\nBut I'm also the guy who on his podcast player out\nSets it to take the final four cats so that it can fit more and somebody listening you actually speed up the ... I don't anymore I used to do that because uh it's you have to give it a hundred percent of your attention when it's a really fast right yeah I used to but now I think the other line of which helps quite a bit you can take\nFor every ten hours I listen I can take out about an hour of science depending on the broadcast wait you take out an automatic playing it's clear it automatically removed the silence and people pause or there's a break between segments or\nThat sort of thing oh man I guess it depends on the topic what pod cast your listeners thoughtful podcast become friends can mimic unfortunately So Paul Goodman silence and his book speaking of language fats assignments that I really want\nThose are the moments that I really appreciate how rear they are going to say even in a church should we think of as being assignment place distilled some of the air conditioning and the cars outside and the kids in Bible study rain or even at a funeral or someplace like that there's a\nMusic playing in the hallway and quite whispered conversations there's no real\nSilence mhm yeah I guess that's what meditation is all about the right to ... to your mind\nWe'd love your thoughts on assignment as a part of communication and language he seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three emails\nWords that we were radio dot org hello you have a way with words Hi Hi this is\nA will calling from Lexington, Kentucky and I had a question about I'm washing machines and dishwashers\nYeah sure we'll get to repair guys out and we'll get that sorted\n[laughter] actually is a bit of a more of an nomenclature question before we moved into the the new house that we have here we did not have one of the automatic dish washing machine we were just doing things by hand so I was calling it the washing machine for a while\nA week apparently is reserved for the call was washing machine so I was just curious are two things one\nWhy does the clothes washing machine ... the official moniker a washing machine whereas the dishwasher has the specific to it and why couldn't call the washing machine the clothes washing machine\nRight because it's it's usually uses a washer the washing machine and very rarely do you do in the word closer laundry when you're talking about the device I think we can sort some of the south for you All right\nImportantly to settle a bit of a disagreeing with my uh girlfriend here is it appropriate to coal\n[laughter] not allowed oh [laughter] are you both from Kentucky\nOh no we're both from Ohio originally we've been in Kentucky about two months now so we haven't quite picked up the way they speak here but we both move around quite a bit a guy that some time in Los Angeles she's got some time and get an of all places or\nOh let's let's set that second part aside for now more than I Do like to interfere with marriages as much as we can [laughter] for sure what kind of a linguistics at first so first thing you've got to understand is that the machine the dish washing machine\nReplaced people who are already known as dishwashers so we called the dish washing machine the dishwasher because the people who used to the job are also known as dishwashers there's a clear like very long separation between the people dishwasher and the machine dishwasher\nAnd actually you can see this happened with the word computer we have this device on her desk now called the computer the people who used to do that kind of really complicated math were also noticed computer so this happens again and again an English where the machine that takes over the human job then get the human name so that's part of the reason why interesting yeah it's part of the reason why the dishwashers called the dishwasher\nThe other thing is that in washing machine that word washing referring to the task of cleaning clothes are doing the laundry is centuries old centuries older than any other kind of\nHow ... form of any word related to washing like we have long needed to launder are close and we have called them the washing or the laundry for very long time so Washington mean washing clothes\nHas been ensconced in specialized that's the word linguist might use special like this one particular kind of washing since the fourteen hundreds\nSo wow All right now because washing when you say I'm going to do the washing most people probably would assume that you were in the U.S anyway would seem that you were talking about the laundry in the u._k. they might actually think that you met the dishes which is really interesting\nThat this thing and I think the other thing that's going on here too is the dishwashers weren't part of the everyday household winds country into the fifties right now and then washing machines where\nLittle or well the word torture meaning machine dishwasher dates to the Eighteen sixties right right but I mean in in somebody's right everyday use of it you know you had industrial dishwashers or radicals dishwashers right [noise] so it really or just kind of an order of events here which kind of use became more common\nIt takes the mantle as\nThe definitive meaning for that word and you find that again and again in English where something kind of wins out and so for example in the U. S. football\nOne out of the meeting for American football and in the world football one out meaning soccer and just they become the defendant meetings football although there have for centuries been many other kinds of football\nBut if you say football people in their mind they think of the one specific more common kind of ... ... you are former football or yeah\nSo have we preserved peace in your household I guess that's the bigger [laughter]\nUh I think so but um are you able to call it a quote washer or is that the gun\nWell yeah you can go why\nI'm going to just to be sure that their customers from older I think\nThe one who loves the laundry and presses the button to call it whatever they were while you're doing the laundry ... wherever you want the most she used to watch whatever she wants\n[laughter] that sounds fun All right take care of early and thanks for your call\nAll right thank you Bye bye\nGood clean fun on this show eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three [noise]\n\nThe conversation we had about the use of the term gypsy and have a lot of people find that offensive to the Roma people", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "21"}
