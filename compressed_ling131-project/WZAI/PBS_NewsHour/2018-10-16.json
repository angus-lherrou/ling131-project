seen\nMassive trees just out of there and we've seen mostly water water can be very damaging horrible\nScary you know when you\nWhen you see water rising fourteen Fifteen feet but nobody is really out

start from the road [noise]\nAll over the panhandle food and water remain scarce and\nPeople are standing in line to get basic supplies\nEven well inland the storms fierce winds knocked down thousands of trees and damaged countless buildings the president saw some of that damage today as he flew from the Florida coast and into Georgia\nLast night he declared a federal emergency in the state and the national guard has already distributing water and other aid all\nOf this as hurricane Michael's explosive power has generated new alarm about climate change super charging these storms on sixty minutes last night the president said he no longer view is climate change as a hoax but he also expressed some ideas that are at odds with the facts\nThe difference but I don't know that his men made I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again\nLast November the federal government's own climate report confirmed the consensus view the humans are driving the rise in global temperatures saying quote there's no convincing alternative explanation\nThe report also dismissed the idea of temperatures cooling again instead it said they're only going up including quote more record setting extremes you have to show me the scientist but last night the president also said he thinks many scientists have a political agenda\nFor the PBS NewsHour and William Wrangham\nNow a new crisis pointed the disappearance of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal ... reports world today that the Saudi Government will admit that he was killed at its consulate in Istanbul, Turkey CNN and the New York times that the Saudis blaming interrogation gone wrong\nSaudi finally permitted Turkish investigators to search the consulate today it is not clear what they found and in Washington President Trump announced he was sending secretary of state Mike Pompeo to meet with Saudi king Solomon [noise]\nBecame firmly denied any knowledge of it [noise] didn't really know maybe [noise] I\nWant to get by but it sounded to me like baby rose killers [noise] oh no we're going to try getting to the bottom of it but it was a\nDenial and our foreign affairs correspondent next year for and joins me now for some insight on what happened today for the president is talking about roads killers as this sound like something we're now going to hear from the Saudi\nThey found a lot like what we're going to hear from the Saudis according to the CNN report the Saudis will admit that they wanted to interrogate Jamal show gee but that there was some kind of rogue team a rogue officer who went too far and killed him and of course road is exactly what we heard\nThe president said today according to see an understatement will also say uh that the Saudis will admit to wanting to bring a show G to Saudi Arabia from turkey and of course that's a NATO ally and that itself\nIs controversial but the fatty and Turkish experts I talked to they say this is a an attempt to have some kind of face saving solution\nYou know again that patient with diabetes making sure that they're checking their what's known as a wants the levels and you know often times the physician doesn't find that out until you know there's an unintended medical of that and the person you know has to be hospitalized because\nYou know their blood sugar has gotten to a level that requires that a medical intervention\nPotentially better some better health outcomes and you made a pretty ambitious a statement when this was an ... you said CBS\nAnd health care but we know prescription drug prices as big as they are only what ten percent of the total cost of American health care so ten percent it's it's not insignificant but that's not the whole picture\nIf the Judy it goes it goes well beyond that we've been talking a lot about we're seeing the consumerism you know of health care and you know we have a lot of discussions about\nYou know when someone a patient of health care when someone a consumer of health care there's no question that you know when you're in the physician's office in the exam room or at the hospital no question about being you know a patient under the direct supervision of\nYou know a physician or you're counting on he or she with which to diagnose a treat you know create that plan but you were leaving too much up to you know what happens with the individual where they now become you know that consumer of health care where you know they're not responsible for\nYou know following that care plan accessing you know the resources that they need\nAnd that's where we see an opportunity to play you know an important role in terms of helping people achieve\nTheir ... their best health and in doing so we know that we can you know reduce the cost of care today\nThese questions I'm putting gay or being raised by a lot of folks who study and help the health care world ah and they look at it and they say these mergers mean they're going to be fewer players your choice\nFor people and so they're expressing worry on the part of Americans that they're going to have the say that they need to have in their own health care and especially in the cost of health care\n[noise] yet Judy ... it's it's a very interesting dynamic in that ... the opportunities that we see you know available to us that we believe we can make broadly available in the market um\nYou know certainly CBS them and you know at the uh creates the scale with such with with which will be able to you know make investments you know to leave this transformation but you know we have every a plan or to make many of these products and services broadly available in the market\nAnd you make a projection in terms of how much prescription drug prices are going to go down and the next five years ten years\nYou know we have made a dent in that cost curve there certainly much more that can be done and I think one of the big opportunities there are many studies out there that you know people simply not taking their medications prescribed is you know causing our healthcare\nThree hundred billion dollars every year you know because of you what the drug represents in terms of improving one's health and when they're not taking it you know the unintended Tibet\nLarry Marlowe CEO at CBS health are about to a part of one of the major mergers and health care world

from the south or just because they were black\n[noise] hello to both of you so the president has been out it seems like every single day out on the trail was in Ohio Pennsylvania\nKentucky Tennessee Tam and he's headed out to this this week as well is there a strategy here what what is a is the president hoping to do and it is he doing\nYeah he has this western swing coming up where he is going to Montana Arizona and Nevada and there's probably a different strategy behind each one of those stops there are competitive Senate races in Arizona and Nevada\nOh and Montana but a Montana may just be a one source told me you might just be getting back and Jon Tester for ah what what he did to to go after a Ronny Jackson\nThe White House doctor who was up for a VA secretary at ... the impression that I'm getting from a lot of the people that I've been talking to a who are are\nSort of Republican in Republican campaign committee is is that a lot of the president's travel is based on what what is best served the president what the president wants to do who wants to promote so we went to Kansas\nBecause that the candidate for governor there as someone who he feels close to he has a good relationship with Kris Kobach I'm so each stop is different but he's going to el ... Nevada uh which is a more rural part of the state law\nSo much more Republican and Amy we've been talking about this in the Senate races other Republicans seem to be holding their own Democrats have a better shot house\nRaces it seems contradictory ... talk a little bit about what ... what's going on yeah it's it's as if this election is taking place in two different countries the race for the Senate is taking place or at least for control of the Senate is taking place and really read parts of America\nThese are states that the president carried by more than Nineteen points and the twenty sixteen election so places like Montana\nOr Missouri I'm North Dakota\nHouse is running through suburban America and in suburban America Trump is very unpopular some of these districts he barely won some of them he narrowly lost\nBut he is certainly very underwater in those suburban districts much more so than the places where he's going on the campaign trail so it is fascinating to watch where he's going even when he goes to Pennsylvania\nHe went to Erie, Pennsylvania which is the one county that slipped from Obama carrying it to Trump carrying it\nWon't notice Pennsylvania isn't on a targeted list for Republicans this year the Senate race looks not very competitive democratic senator up there and the Democratic governor seems to be cruising right along as well instead it's just the places where he's\nReally deep ... that are really the bread that she can go to those places that determines the twenty sixteen election Michigan Wisconsin\nPennsylvania he's not spending as much time there and Democrats are doing very well there at least statewide Democrats\nAnd ham what's happened to this enthusiasm gap that we liked it or enthusiast and whether it's a gap or not what's happened with that at one point that Democrats were ahead to Republicans caught up a little bit what are we looking at now how much of a of a difference\nAnd making it it's really unclear right now whether this was\nA shift that was related to Kavanaugh whether it is a enduring shift or whether it is a shift that was going to happen as the election got closer people started paying more attention and Republicans came home um and\nI think it's really hard right now to know exactly what it is\nYeah but it is I think that's I think that's right when I talked to Republicans they'd just consistently tell me they just feel a lot better in these districts that are sort of congenitally read right that's where they didn't see that\nW ... members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a ... member visit Cape and islands dot org\nReal challenge for Republicans right now though is that the Democratic enthusiasm hasn't wait wait I'm waned excuse me for like a New Year's forever right that there is intensity as they were better just isn't deterred and she also determined\nAnd we're spending a lot of time looking to were independent voters are going and right now the Trump is somewhere around\nForty percent approval rating among independents you look at some of the most recent polls that came out today or this week the president um or the the president still not doing well with independents and then you ask the question about\nWho do you want to vote for for Congress independence breaking for Democrats by double digits that's where it gets very dangerous one Republican said to me we can equal a turnout with Democrats but if we're losing independence by double digits we're still in deep doo doo and that's the challenge\nIs so and we've also been talking about whether there was a gender piece of the story and that's something we've addressed in the past\nBut Tam today there was this back and forth between Elizabeth Warren who for whom it was released her DNA testing test results were made public it turns out she does have some Native American blood going back six to ten generation the president to it of course it challenged her\nTo do this to make a long story short\nUm had said he would donate a million dollars now he's saying he wouldn't do it unless he did it it\nIt's just I mean I how long it's going to end up having to exactly what it does this go anywhere it is it are women voters attention to this it's a little early for Twenty one is it's a little early for twenty twenty but if you watch the video that Elizabeth Warren put out to go along with these test results\nThere is no denying that that is a very slick campaign video introducing herself to America\nOr re introducing herself to America at one thing about Elizabeth Warren and President Trump this is a rivalry a that goes back a very long way on the twenty sixteen campaign trail when Elizabeth Warren was campaigning for Hillary Clinton she had a unique ability to sort of troll\nCandidate Trump to to get him to say thing got under his skin he got under his skin and and then along comes his term that he keeps using for Elizabeth Warren the Pocahontas term um\nLee offensive but in the end President Trump picks these feuds and fights with all of these people and and somehow the people he feuds with end up being the ones that are solid and he just keeps going just twenty seconds\nAmy I guess it's never too early to talk about twenty two well there are a lot of Democrats some of whom I talked to today who would like Democrats not to talk about twenty twenty and they said we're doing really well ... we got our sights on twenty Eighteen\nNational Democrats don't start making this about you keep the focus on twenty Eighteen on the issues we want to talk about not the challenger to president travels see if anybody's paying attention to those admonition Amy Walter ... thank you both they're often
