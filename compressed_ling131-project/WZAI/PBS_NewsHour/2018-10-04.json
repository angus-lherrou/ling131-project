me now along with our congressional correspondent Lisa deja dead hello\nTo both of you so you ... as you point out in that report originally President Trump was respectful of Dr Ford he was a saying she she was a credible someone who is credible but then the change of tone last night he's mocking her what was behind the thinking there well\nThis nomination has really become a moment of cultural reckoning and President Trump is responding to how polarized everyone has become he senses us versus we mentality and he's and their last night and he feels as though he wants to to really give the crowd what they're asking for the crowd last night was laughing and clapping as he mocked doctor\nFor it and that's just as important as the president mocking her and this idea that\nPeople are really kind of especially Republicans are really feeling energized by this is backed up by a new poll that came out today PBS NewsHour NPR and merits put out a ... and I want to walk you through some of these numbers um\nIn July two thousand Eighteen the summer Democrats had a ten point in need of Republican when it came to who thought\nWas the who thought these midterm elections with a very important so you have this idea that Democrats really felt as though it's really important but that is all basically evaporated the poll now shows the eighty two percent of Democrats described in mid term as very important in eighty percent of Republicans also described the midterms is very important and the Democrats\nThat should be really bad news for them because Democrats have been talking about this blue wave talking about taking back the house even the Senate and now you have a Republican saying this nomination is why I might go to the polls\nSo uh so energizing Republicans but you've been talking to people at the White House how concerned are they or are they concerned that this could cost them somehow in the mid ...\nThe court decision is supposed to be legally binding but um pay

say on a variety of topics ... friend has that Judy\nPutting sat down with top energy industry CEOs and the Saudi oil minister as part of an annual conference he was questioned at length by news hour special correspondent Ryan\n... who lived in Russia for Twenty years and moderating the panel Ryan joins me now from ... from Moscow Ryan thank you very much set the scene for today and one of the main things ah you talked about was a former Russian spy should act so big conference about a thousand\nPeople in the many of whom waited for about an hour for a president who arrive and for the front\nOf a recession to begin obviously it being an energy conference the subject does\nYour ah was energy however in Russia sanctions is not a topic that you can ignore they affect the energy sector they affect the entire Russian economy so I asked president booed and how he intends to deal with some more sanctions that are going to be imposed upon Russia\nAs a result of Russia's alleged involvement in the poisoning of a former Russian spy by the name of surrogates Paul\nIn response to that question president prudent chose to speak about this by himself\nA push of college and some of those ... I see some of your colleagues are pushing this idea that Mr Scrooge ... it was almost some kind of human rights and to this is just the spy a traitor of ... when you get it there is such a thing as a traitor the mother\nHe's one of the imagine if you had someone Richard\nYour country what would you think about them what would anyone sitting in this room think if we were talking about someone from their own country he's just to come back and that's all and they've just initiated this whole information campaign around this issue\nAnd he didn't stop there Ryan did he he also proclaimed Russia's innocence he did and keep in mind that\nThis was no simple attack on the spy a chemical agent was used this was done in the United kingdom and there were other people that were affected so I asked president prudent about that\nAs being on the side I think there are two other issues one is the use of chemical weapons um and let's not forget that in addition to I'm just going to ... family are being affected in in that attack\nThere was also a a homeless person who was killed when they came in contact with a nerve agent of a joke [noise]\nYou know this month or so but it was ... yeah I sometimes I look at everything that's\nSome guy showed up and started poisoning homeless people what kind of nonsense is that what are they street cleaners and you can win so this was a really sloppy affair right uh\nThat you had by standards that were uh hurting the attack and that reference there to what were they street cleaners is because\nOf a a homeless woman who died as a result of this attack actually picked up\nA bottle of perfume that the nerve agent British authorities tell us had been placed on and used it so\nPresident fruit and here is effectively saying what well if we were behind this would we have been that unprofessional of course not Russian intelligence agents are very professional this this floppy stuff it's absurd to think that such an unprofessional act would have been carried out by Russian agents\nYou also ask him about Russian meddling in us elections not only of course what Russia is accused by the U.S intelligence\nAgencies are doing in twenty sixteen uh but also twenty eight teams are and what intelligence agencies say Russia is still doing this year let's take a listen to the answer on that\n... uh uh I'd like to see the insanity and concerning Russia's intervention in some us elections in for the American political leads to calm down and finally work things out amongst themselves\nSo that like we said it will markets they reach some kind of equilibrium balance of common sense and shared national interest in that I like that in the process of their own internal ... they don't pollute Russian American relations and negatively affect the rest of the world to them they used to try and that's\nKind of denial that that Russia is involved in twenty eight team but as ... as potent expressing frustration that he and a lot of Russians have that they simply haven't gotten the results of improve relations that President Trump promised back in twenty six ten\nYeah that's right and if you think about it going back to Helsinki when president who met with President Trump\nA president a hoot and told the world that he actually supported President Trump he wanted President Trump to win I should say in the election because President Trump promised better relations with the United states so you you kind of wonder well did he backed the wrong horse because\nIn a way as a result of President Trump or being so compromise by this investigation the relationship with Russia or the ... rush in the United states is in many ways perhaps much worse than it would have been\nSurely came into power but you know when you asked president who in about ... he doesn't take the bait if you will he doesn't he's not going to throw President Trump\nA under the bus as far as President Trump is concerned this is a Democratic Party inspired conspiracy they're just angry at a President Trump for winning the election he thinks President Trump\nWon the election fair and square and by the way he thinks that the Democrats have it out for him and Russia as well so he didn't give any make any suggestion really that uh because things aren't ah you know sort of\nA coming at turning out as he was hoping in terms of Russian American relations ... medically wasn't going to blame Donald Trump himself for that\nBut he did have some criticism of President Trump and specifically of a statement President Trump made last week so first let's listen to that this is a statement of President Trump speaking at the U.N General assembly a referring to the leading oil producing countries of OPEC which is led by Saudi Arabia\nWe defended many of these nations for nothing and then they take advantage of us like giving us high oil prices not good\nWe want them to stop raising prices we want them to start lowering prices and they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on\nThe Trump is blaming oil producers for higher prices are headed prudent respond to that\nWell pollutant blame President Trump and the Trump administration's imposition of sanctions\nWhat's your sense of you know it's so it's true I\nThat the uh the financial crisis cost a lot of people their jobs in their homes and their careers and their hopes and dreams to some extent and so we want to avoid that\nAnd you know over the ten years really since the depths of the crisis or we have seen a tremendous recovery in the in the labor market in the economy generally a labor force participation is back to normal levels in fact even above normal levels it doesn't mean that this strong economy is\nIs is reached every American it hasn't you know we know that there are demographics and there are regions and industries and individuals who\nHave not uh you know have not been affected haven't gotten their jobs back and so\nYou know these big negative events are are quite costly like a financial crisis so we've done really a lot of things\nThe course of the last decade to try to avoid having that experience again\nLet's talk about something I guess your favorite subject interest rate town right now it seems to me half the world is worried that you were raising rates to slowly they say growth is so strong labor markets are so tight inflation could take off the other half of the world\nHall or as much as you are they argue you are widening inequality gap that are already out there that as we've been discussing wages are too low you obviously think here threading the needle about right but what makes you show\n'em so it sounds like we're doing something right um I'll talk about the to risk that you mentioned so\nThe first risk is that we that we moved too quickly and we prematurely and expansion and inflation never gets solidly back to two percent and that's always a risk at this point in the cycle where the economy is growing now for nine years in his tenure tempt your growth\nThe alternative risk is that we we moved too quick to slowly sorry and they do to slowly and the economy overheat and that can show up in the form of too high inflation or you know a\nFinancial marking imbalances in that kind of thing so you look at those two risk so for a long long time after the financial crisis second risk wasn't a risk at all we were far away from full employment and inflation was blurred target so we kept rates low for a long long time and get them to zero for a long time\nAnd we had a lot of advice to move more quickly and raise interest rates and I'm very happy we didn't follow the advice because I think of it benefit of the country benefited a workers and\nAnd their families so I'm now we've come to a situation where unemployment is I mentioned as close to it a twenty year low and headed lower by all accounts\nAnd the the really are extraordinarily accommodate of low interest rates that we needed when the economy was quite we we don't need those anymore they're not appropriate anymore we need interest rates to be gradually very gradually moving back toward normal\nPresident Trump a as you've noted that he started out early on talking about how he believes the fed should remain independent and even given credit for appointing high quality nominees to the fed board but he's also this summer this past summer criticized the fat and the policy of raising race\nYou write that office\nExcuse me is just politics or does it put some kind of pressure on you or is the chairman of the fat and and does it harm the institution because this is something presidents have rarely done\nYou know we uh my focus is a is essentially on controlling the control and that's when we control what we do [noise]\nWe do with the facts and you know this is um to anyone who is known our institution overtime\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support double UCI at Cape and islands dot org\nIs for views tried to come to a consensus and try to do the right thing we're insulated from political cycles because our terms run they don't run it continuously or if it's the same cycle is elections\nAnd we just try to do the right thing for the medium and longer term for the country and you know that's I think that's why a lot of people want to work at the fed is because there's tremendous satisfaction doing that we don't let other things distract us and and we're just going to focus on on those jobs that's just always how we're going to be\nYou have a communication privately that the president after\nYou know\nYou said recently that you've been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesses around the country about terrorists weddings athletes are you hearing\nPeople were concerned about rising material costs and tariffs and the loss of markets and supply chains in a big way can certainly ... supply chains have been\nA you know under construction and now very fully built out over the course of almost a quarter century\nSo they're very important to the way the global economy works we've been hearing concerned about that you don't see anything in the numbers and maybe you wouldn't expect to yet but you you don't see we don't see detect any slower growth or lower investment or lower hiring or any any of the effects that might flow from\nMore uncertainty on the ... business\nWhat keeps you awake at night if anything when it comes to this economy in the world economy\nBasically everything you know nobody nobody wants to central bankers sleeping [laughter]\nWhat good is that [noise]\nYou know I I we we if we get getting monetary policy right at the question you started with this is so important for the public and so we all of us who work at the fed think this is the thing we think about all the time if we were on monetary policy is we've got to get that right and um 'cause the you know the the benefits of doing that are are very broad for the country\nAnd you know there though it's a world full of risk so many things can go wrong and I probably lose sleep over different things every night\nDo you worry how much do you worry that there can be another financial crash\nMy my guess is that the next set of problems we have will won't look a lot like the last set of problems we had you know I I I think there's we don't detect\nUm measures of financial stability of financial instability as being elevated at this time they're sort of in the moderate range and in our view view of our staff and certainly in my view so\nOh a cyber attack or some kind of global event those are the kinds of things or maybe it will surprise us and look exactly like the west but we don't really see you don't see the kind of build up of risks in in the financial markets or let alone in the banking system where where we received much less ...\nMeanwhile wearing Goldilocks your words now [noise]\nThe floodwaters are still receding from Hurricane Florence and the damage which could total well over twenty billion dollars is still being assessed\nThe flooding was far worse than the wins from this storm and it has prompted a larger conversation once again about what can happen to other coastal cities that is the focus of miles O'Brien report tonight for our weekly segment on the leading edge of science technology and health\nIn Miami it's not a matter of beer but rather when the big one will hit\nSo at Florida International university they had built a wall of when to buttress their defenses\nSo here they intake wow we have a ... fine six feet each diameter seven high horse power each and we can go up to three five level we ...\nYou'll want us these this is an associate professor in the civil and environmental engineering department\nHere they build scale models and subject them to hurricane force winds\nYou they're showing them how buildings fail\nHow they can be built to endure a sustained barrage\nWe need to understand how these tried to respond\nTo an extreme event everything that goes into the building codes and we found out a either resolved do research\nHurricane Andrew was a pivotal moment\nA category five storm made landfall south of Miami in homestead on August twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety two\nThe damage was widespread and made worse\nBy inadequate building codes but that was that\nFor a much better place compared to Ninety Ninety two or even the nineties a southern building codes are enforced today are a much more streak\nBut today in South Florida engineers and emerging\nWorried about the threat from water there were four other projects from the regents for for the Susie\n... is the chief Brazilians officer for the city of Miami Beach\nThe lessons learned from after Andrew created the south Florida building code really for wind and that was adopted 'em to the floor in a building code how do we actually started looking at flooding and sea level rise and and look at our building code and and start to add more measures in there for adaptation for that\nSo I think that's you know something that we can learn from the past and are bringing into the president\nMiami Beach is a seven square mile barrier island it's just slow between Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic ocean\nThat makes us a beautiful but vulnerable and so we are vulnerable to flooding a obviously a vulnerable to the effects of sea level rise and and nowadays the typical rain storms that we would get in South Florida in the afternoons
