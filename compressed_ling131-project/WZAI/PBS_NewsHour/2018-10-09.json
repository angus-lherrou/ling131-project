Washington Post journalist [noise] the next steps in working with North Korea to secure a nuclear deal much more [noise]\n\nAs reported earlier the inter governmental panel on climate change which is a consortium of climate scientists announced\nToday that if the world community doesn't reduce carbon emissions drastically millions of people across the planet will suffer dire consequences but as William rang and report heating that warning now is a daunting challenge\nThe UN's latest report put together by over Ninety authors and editors from over forty countries is probably these darkest most dire warning yet about the severity of climate change and the cost of inaction\nReport says that unless the world's immediately begins reducing the burning of coal and oil and gas the drive up global temperatures the world will suffer tremendous consequences\nBy his earliest twenty forty just twenty two years from now the un says global food supplies will be threatened by increasing drought and heat waves ... nations could be flooded by rising sea levels potentially triggering huge flows of refugees\nSevere storms and wildfires will grow in intensity costing billions and damages and lives lost to keep even more drastic impacts at bay the un report urges the governments of the world to cut carbon emissions enough\nTo limit global warming to just one and a half degrees Celsius that's about to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nAbove pre industrial levels but that would take a near revolutionary change in how the industrialized world creates electricity\n... not the constantly nor the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the constantly embassy are working to search for him we're worried about this case\nBut today Turkish president regimen tired ... said that denial wasn't enough of them get on ... the consular officials can't save themselves by saying she left here the relevant authorities are obligated to provide proof of this claim\nToday President Trump offered his first comments about how show the when asked\nIt and hopefully that will sort of jumped out right now nobody knows anything about it but this is a pretty bad stories I Do not like it\nI'll show the never considered himself the opposition only someone was facing this country ended freedom in the Washington Post this weekend a blank space ... column would have been the headline missing voice\nAnd joining me now is Fred Hi at the Washington Post editorial page editor thank you very much what about his voice has been so vital uh and and what about his voice drew you to him initially he's a unique\nVoice I think because um he really knows Saudi Arabia or he as you know he's been a journalist there for a long time he was\nSomebody who uh knows the people who run the country or as well as the the ordinary folks and he's a real patriot\nOr who rode from the point of view of wanting the regime and Saudi Arabia to do the right thing um and I think what made him unusual was a ... you know he was willing to take these risks are\nFor himself including leaving the country are going into exile um\nAnd being a truth teller or because he had hopes that Saudi Arabia might really moving the right direction I should say has hopes that Saudi Arabia might move in the right direction and I'm a and he was trying to kind of be a positive voice pushing them in that direction\nYou referred to the risks that he took that he expressed concern for safety\nI don't think anybody are expected something or like the worst of what is being speculated now but I think\nYou know when he left the country more than a year ago he said there are a lot of people in Saudi Arabia who can't speak the truth there in jail or they're being muzzled I have the opportunity or if I give everything up in my country to go out and continue to speak the truth I think he knew um\nYou know that put potentially relatives at risk it put a you know ... know exiles feels completely um sanguine um but at the same time I don't think anybody would have expected or\nSomething like what we're most afraid of now\nSpoke with the state department earlier and all they would say is that we are closely\nThat's doing enough I think uh you know Jamal was a resident of the United states it was a columnist for the Washington Post\nThat puts the United states government in a position to have both the basis and the obligation to demand answers if if it is true and we continue to hope beyond hope that it's not true\nIf it is true that a foreign government lured one of its own citizens into one of its diplomatic properties on foreign soil and then had a murder\nIt's unprecedented in modern times we've ever seen anything like that and there's no way it seems to me that Congress or in American administration could just go back to normal relations with a country that would do that so\nMany in ministry edition and Congress in our view should be asking for answers and asking for information and are doing a lot more loudly and insistent way than what we've heard so far\nFred hire the Washington Post thank you very much\nThank you and joining me now is Robin Wright she writes the New Yorker magazine and as a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for scholars Robin Wright thank you very much\nFor joining us you just heard Fred Hi it described how there should not be a normal us Saudi relationship if this incident turns out to be true and we've heard bipartisan outrage from multiple senators are from multiple sides\nAre of the ideological spectrum saying that there should be a break and us Saudi relations\nIf this is true so uh is that possible is a kind of break between the U.S and Saudi Arabia possible\nI doubt it uh the fact is Saudi Arabia is central to the Trump administration's policy in the middle east\nOr Saudi Arabia was his first destination a as president\nThere was a enormous pomp and ceremony when he arrived\nA Saudi Arabia is central to what is attempt at a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians is central to his counterterrorism program\nOr his own son in law who was his chief advisor on the middle east is a very close personal friend of Mohammed bin ... on the crown prince who is on allegedly linked to the state of this wonderful Saudi\nUm critic and in my longtime friend to them all\nSo are the prospects of this change anything I think are unlikely the bigger question in some ways for Saudi Arabia is what impact does this have on foreign businesses\nSpeaking about investing in the kingdom uh that that kind of big time money was is essential to the crown princes ambitious plans\nTo develop the kingdom to to to diversify the economy we on the oil and there are maybe some who will wonder about the uh legitimacy that commitment of the crown prince to genuine reforms given his track record since taking over last year\nFor giving his need for some of those reforms given his need for western investment or what does it say about Saudi priorities under Mohammed been so long\nI think mom and been someone has proven to be a quite\nRuthless when it comes to silencing his critics he talks about reforms for women and then he turns around after giving them the right to drive an interesting some of those who had been the most vocal on women's rights and one of them was recently sentenced to death there are those who were the\nModerate clerics\nCondemning and speaking out against Sunni extremism or Islamic extremism some of those many of those have been picked up and some of those have been sentenced to death\nAnd it's clear that there as Jamal head off and said there is under the current leadership very little if any room for criticism a or questioning\nAnd very quickly Robin Wright a President Trump has criticized journalists you have praised authoritarians uh there's that kind of talk or have any impact on this event that we are talking about today\nI think the idea of human rights is generally not been very important to the Trump Administration and hasn't spoken out made it an important part of its foreign policy or the fact that this is a journalist and criticizing a country in a leadership very close to the Trump Administration I doubt it will produce any kind of immediate impact or significant impact\n[noise] Robin Wright thank you very much thank you [noise]\nStay with us coming up on the news hour it's politics Monday on the race for control of Congress\nAuthor Michael Lewis on the critical mission of government and a tiny island at risk of seeing it's community and livelihoods washed out [noise]\nThe U.S secretary of state visited North Korea yesterday to continue negotiations with the regime there over its nuclear program it is a process that has seen it\nYang report this does it produce some guarded optimism [noise]\nIt was all smiles around the table for a Sunday lunch in Pyongyang where North Korea's nuclear arsenal was the main menu items [noise]\nLater secretary of state Mike Pompeo reported significant progress in his talks with North Korea and Supreme leader Kim Jong own way I Would\nThe north state run television echoed that positive tone for just the two sides agreed to establish working level talks on a second summit between President Trump and Kim Pompeo also told reporters that the north agreed to allow inspectors at a nuclear test site the north says it demolished last spring [noise]\nAdministration has expressed doubts sided actually been destroyed sick\nFried hacker is former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory he's visited North Korea several times\nThat I've been so much skepticism about whether what the North Koreans did actually it would make a difference or not the way they would make it easy for them to test so it's a big deal to actually let someone come in and\nTo evaluate whether that really sets back to test site significantly it's an important confidence building measure as far as I'm concerned\nPresident Trump's confidence is already running high he recently expressed a fondness for the north Korean leader he wants to write it adds a little rocket man\nUm the risk that uh some nuclear bomb is going to go off when it shouldn't go off managed out of the department of energy or that we won't have an accurate picture of the society that is out of the department Congress that collects all the statistics about the society\nI mean you move across the government is breathtaking how many mission critical things there are and how it's being done in spite of of this vague hostility the society has to its own government\nYour reporting really covers the period after Trump is clearly going to be the president and the transition that goes on when one administration switches to the next how would you characterize broadly speaking how that transition happened in in in\nWhat occurred so there's what's folks to happen in his what happened which supposed to happen is that the outgoing administration spends nine months and the thousand people's time building briefing books across the administration so the ... and the idea was the day after the election\nWon would send hundreds of people into the government to get the briefings and the Trump Administration did not show up they never bothered to learn what these agencies are doing\nThe book has so many fascinating vignettes of people who work with in these ...\nThere's one story that stands out to use is emblematic of this larger\nIssue that you're talking about well the larger issue of the ignorance of the problem the ignorance of the mission and and as a result putting the wrong person in\nI mean there are hundreds of apples but I mean I think when it's easily described is inside the department of agriculture\nThere is a chief scientist and this person is responsible for distributing three billion dollars in research grants every year\nAnd this is going to agricultural research most of it one way or the now associated with climate change how we're going to ... how are we going to continue to grow food and grace sheep and milk cows in different in a different climate and it's a serious issue it's the planning for them you know the food supply of fifty years from now [noise]\nThe person who was doing that was a a very distinguished research scientist agriculture is named Kathy ... she's a world class authority on the subject of agricultural science\nTrump replaced her with a right wing talk show radio host from uh from Iowa who happened to supported him in the election who had no science background at all that kind of thing taking people who who really knows something and replacing them with people who are just loyalists who have absolutely no idea what the mission is\nIs a theme that runs right through the administration\nDoes the mission suffer I mean I think obviously you could look at that kind of a transition and say that seems a drastic shifted priority but these bureaucracies largely have a career staff that are they're largely permanently I mean doesn't doesn't that staff keep the mission going for the most part\nSo of the top six thousand career civil servants in the federal workforce\nTwenty percent of them quit or or were fired the first year of the Trump Administration so already there's like you can see a gutting the civil service and the idea that these people are\nLazy or stupid or dead weight on the society is I think it's the most sinister idea alive in this country right now I really do and I think and it's because they are they're very mission driven people\nThey're very knowledgeable people where they weren't as money people ah and me neither not enough money for themselves yeah that's right you don't take these jobs to be famous rich and famous you take these jobs because you really care about to say\nAnd I'm\nThere the government and without those people displaced collapses this place being this society society it's not like the government is a tool that we might use to address the biggest problems we have\nBiggest problem moving to deal with climate change that's going to be from the government if you do ... anything having to do with science and technology all the basic research the very basic research is done with government ... through the government because\nIf it's not going to pay out and the next ten to Fifteen Years industry doesn't want to have anything to do with it the future is driven by what the government does and it has been in this country forever I mean you don't get the Internet that the government you don't get the iPhone without the government you know get GPS without a government we are drastically cheating the future\nWhen we beat the government the way we treat it it's not as Trump I mean we've been doing this year for several decades just playing with the idea that the government's the problem not the solution is he is just the ultimate expression of the problem I think of is like I'm\nBack of his ... exquisitely important machine that we've allowed through our own neglect to accumulate rust over the decades and now he's come in with a sledgehammer and and yeah we're pay real price will pay attention in the last third of the book you really talk about the the\nThe centrality of government data and how important that is and there's a few passengers where you list a lot of ways in which the Trump Administration has been scrubbing its Web sites have data USDA was removing reports of farm animals being abused the consumer financial Protection Bureau removing reports of financial abuse\nFemale removing data about electricity and water and Puerto Rico after the hurricane what is behind that\nAll the climate change that data across the right at the department of energy to visit there is a threat any way to the weather data being accessible\nIt is not ideological\nWhen it's being driven by narrow financial interests someone financial and someone has a business it's going to it's going to be more profitable if this information is not available\nAnd so it's ... it's ranchers who want to be able to abuse animals or it's it's a it's a weather company that doesn't want the weather data publicly accessible because they want to be able to sell it to people\nAfter talking with all of these different officials working within these crucial agencies what is the thing that\nScares you some most what keeps you up its abroad saying and the processing is fantastic ... of this moment we're going to look back and say there were many unless we drastically she of course look back and say there were many moments\nWhere we cheated the future by by the way we behave in the present and I think that's ... that's been true for a while but I think it's really true right now\nThe book is the fifth risks Michael Lewis thank you so much for having me [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd finally and I look at a place right here in the United states where scientists say the effects of climate change our plane to see young yang travel to ten year island in the Chesapeake Bay\nA tiny speck of land that is shrinking as the sea level rises [noise]\nThe sun is barely up but the Waterman of tangy Virginia have already been out on the Chesapeake Bay for hours one after another boat shuttle back and forth to the islands tiny harbor carrying their delicious cargo\nChesapeake blue crabs which thrive in these waters the provided a livelihood for generations of residents on this bit of modern marsh twelve miles from shore\nOn a commercial

this kind of title flooding is an unusual after a big nor'easter like the one that just blew through because it pushes all the water up from the east but some fear this could be a glimpse into the future for tangy her island\nThe Army Corps of engineers estimates tangiers lost nearly two thirds of its land mass students Eighteen fifty that's about fourteen hundred acres if nothing is done
