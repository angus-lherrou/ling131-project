FBI pro sold out of Washington forum it\nOr who do much to give a little leeway because of what he's done through but on the other hand we can't have this on the court we simply can't but most\nRepublicans took aim at the Democrats\nWell if you were accused falsely\nAre committing a crime wouldn't you be angry too when you want to clear your good name\nWell that's exactly what judge Kavanaugh do they call him a lying\nUm sexual predator and the man defended himself and as a result of a shady doesn't happen to me are going to be on the Supreme Court\nThings such a drivel\nDemocrat said today they want an FBI briefing at least twenty four hours before any vote California Senator Dianne Feinstein the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee\nWe have to put all the facts together here and this is is this is a I guess it's my tense Supreme Court hearing that I sat on and there's never been one like this with the issues like this\nBut a key undecided Republican Alaska's Lisa Murkowski said she is not concerned that the process of moving too quickly this as a leader McConnell vowed again to hold a cabinet vote this week meantime a lawyer for Kavanaugh's high school friend mark judge said today the FBI has now completed his interview\nAlong with our White House correspondent beach I'll send or hello to both of you another busy day Lisa uh what do we know right now about timing about when this FBI investigation will finish and when there can be a final vote on Kavanaugh in\nThe Senate right the FBI was given up to one week that ends friday to do this investigation they could finish earlier some Republican senators think they may finished earlier that could be Wednesday Thursday\nI'm In the meantime there are some key witnesses that have not yet been um interviewed in particular Christine Blasey Ford's team sent out a letter tonight saying they've been trying to get in touch with the FBI they have not heard back since one phone call on friday and they say they are concerned that the FBI may not interview her at all\nWe're not really sure the FBI is not really obviously revealing what their plan is sometimes key witnesses are needed last we have to wait and see on that how that goes meanwhile\nMitch McConnell would like to have this final vote this week this week means Saturday I fly and the way that would work because of the Senate rules there is a series of procedural hurdles they have to clear the big vote is a procedural vote called cloture in\nOrder to have the cloture vote Judy McConnell must have filed a motion and then you wait two days for that vote so if he files that motion tomorrow it was ... as we expect the Senate could have that he procedural vote on friday\nThat's what McConnell wants now what happened did you have to watch these key undecided senators to see if they want more time to read the FBI report McConnell said he wants them to read it quickly once they get it\nI don't know that they will want to do that also will report being made public another question unanswered right now\nNumber of number of questions meantime image the president does seem to be sticking with Brett Kavanaugh why\nThis local nomination has really become a cause celebrated for a lot of Republicans the president said that he went to a rally um this week in Tennessee and that he heard from so many people Republicans people who support or who want him to keep fighting for Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd President Trump loves to go to these rallies around the country and really listen to his base and really check check what they're thinking it's kinda the way that he looks at polling so the fact that he could is continuing to hear from people who say he should stick by Brett Kavanaugh and the president really feels this way personally because he feels as though the Democrats\nCould ... if he has to withdraw this nomination\nAnd and Lisa I'm you know picking up on that it give us more of a sense of the temperature in the Senate are Republicans feeling way we heard what McConnell and Senator McConnell of Senator Kennedy and others are saying are they feeling pressure in any way to rethink this they are feeling\nWell there's there's too many findings are one is that the the Inheritance The Donald Trump got from his father is far greater than anybody has a ... and his state and things like\nYou got a simple one million dollar loan you paid it back with interest there's been stories that have said it was larger we've been able to identify it to hundreds of millions of dollars more than four hundred but even more important he was able to get the boss of heritage because it was swelled through fraudulent talk schemes we uncovered is\nA financial documents that we found\nNow we should say at the outset that the president's lawyer Charles Harder has issued a statement saying the New York times allegations of\nFraud and tax evasion are one hundred percent false and highly defamatory we also have a statement from President Trump's brother Robert Trump\nWho says all appropriate gift an estate tax returns were filed a required taxes were paid I Want to get that out there on the record before I ask you though about what exactly was the tax\nMethod the tax scheme or whatever term you use that that uh Trump's father a friend tromp\nUsed in order to pass this money along\nWell it's interesting that there are several that are that are discussed in the stores and they have varying levels of either talks broader tax avoidance talks of Asia but the main one that we found\nIs a it was a company called all county in the back story to it as Fred Trump when he became in his eighties he owned dozens of buildings around New York um and they he was getting old and he he had very little that on the buildings and he had mountains of cash\nIn these buildings and the the children realize that if she died at some point he was getting to be ... you know in his eighties that they would be stuck with paying a fifty five percent inheritance tax on the money\nSo what they did is they created a company it was called all county building supply um and\nThey were they were shareholders of it and what they did was Fred Trump is part of running the buildings had to buy everything from you know boilers paint 'em plumbing supplies all this stuff\nAnd he would pay vendors for it and one day all county started buying it they would pay the vendors and then they would send a separate chalk up to their died\nAnd it would be padded anywhere from twenty to fifty percent and so ... and they and they and they would pocket the difference and then the interesting thing about that as they would then pocket the difference and then separately they use these padded receipts\nAnd they sent them and they use them to justify the padded receipts to justify wrench increases on their tenants that we're living in rent regulated buildings we have the receipts where they did this and we also have testimony from depositions we obtain where they say they did this\nAnd and you're in other words they went to ... quite elaborate steps they took a extraordinary steps to avoid paying additional millions and millions of dollars in taxes\nThey took elaborate steps but in that case\nIt's kind of gangster ask I mean it's like one day you're paying him now you're paying me and it's twenty percent more it just happened to be their father and they were able to turn doing this they were able to drain that cash that he was sitting on his buildings were sitting on you know tens and tens of millions which we saw when we started looking at the financial documents they how\nThey were able to take it out to avoid the fifty five percent\nUm estate or death taxes they call it\nI mean that's kind of the main one that we found that was emblematic of some of the other things that we are going on\nSuzanne Craig among other things you write that Fred Trump Trump the president's father was relentless and creative in finding ways to channel his wealth to his children um what was President Trump's role in that\nWell if he was he was a for many years of\nHis life a recipient has incredible when we started digging into it not only were their trust funds but Fred Trump over his life he made ah he made his children um his bankers instead of loan it instead of borrowing money from bank he would borrow money from them they had money and trust they would set up loans and he would pay them interest\nUm he paid Donald Trump consulting fees there was just these these incredible streams of revenue that were coming from Fred Trump to his ... to his kids in order to get money to them\nAnd and are you able to identify in the peace what is out now potentially illegal and what was just on the edge of what might have been legal\nWe do the the one that I mentioned is a note you know as far as we're concerned a note fraud and not only um you know was the ... county the one where they were rolling the money out of out of the buildings they've been passed um they passed some of that burden on to their to their tenets and that that sort of goes into things including wire fraud according to the people that we've talked to\nAnd then there was other things that they did I'm with her father's estate I'm the boss border on tax avoidance tax evasion and tax fraud and in one instance just a simple example\nI'm Donald Trump his and his siblings uh Robert trumping and Marion Barry Trump they signed off on their father's estate and in doing so they have to verify the accuracy\nOf all the gift turns ... returns that were submitted some of those had um had things like they did the the gifts they knew that they had gotten from all county they didn't disclose them and so that becomes again another another potential crime that they they committed\nAnd as you say on this uh fights the narrative from the president that he uh made a made millions on his own that he inherited and Ari ...\nThe story of a father and his son and his relationship\nThat they had 'em through the years and and just how Donald Trump created this narrative you know in his when he was in Nineteen Seventy six when he was not far out of work and that he basically appropriated his father's um wealth has its own newspaper stories he made a huge splash and not hot and I I'm worth hundreds of millions of dollars\nNothing could have been further from the truth that was from Trump's money\n[noise] Suzanne ... extraordinary reporting thirty eight pages a when you print it out at the New York times thank you thank you [noise]\n\nAnd now we returned to new questions about judge Brett Kavanaugh has passed and the future of his confirmation battle in the Senate\nAnd the Chris Coons a Democrat from Delaware and he serves on the Senate Judiciary committee senator thank you for joining us again what are you know at this point about the state of the FBI investigation this supplemental investigation\nI'm Judy I Know that it's ongoing I Know that agents have been investigating an interviewing people over the last couple of days I Do not know what the exact scope is of this investigation or when they intend to bring it to a close\nWell as our Lisa does your dad report it a few minutes ago a there is now a letter from a Dr Blass he Ford's attorneys\nOr to the FBI saying that none of their the information they've offered their phone calls have not been a return the information they've offered to turn over has not that the FBI hasn't taken him up on that\nWhat's your understanding of that their efforts to to seek any further information from Dr Blass before\nI I don't have direct knowledge of this from the FBI I'm obviously um but I think that um both judge Kavanaugh and Dr Ford\nUm should have been questioned or early in this process and then the other individuals who've made allegations against a judge Kavanaugh or a documents that were brought forward in last week's\nSenate Judiciary committee testimony last Thursday\nI'm should be used as the basis for further investigation I was concerned Judy last Sunday when there were press reports that the entire investigation was going to consist of questioning for individual\nAnd that would be it um I certainly had imagined\nA broader more open more Folsom investigation this week\nWhen President Trump said that he had directed\nAt the White House counsel Don McGahn to say that the FBI should be free to pursue all reasonable investigatory lead\nOn this week I'm as they pursue the credible claims in front of the Judiciary Committee\nUm I don't think we'll know exactly how many people were interviewed and by whom are into friday but I also have tried to refer forward to the FBI of people who've contacted via office I'm not voting for the credibility of their claims I'm just trying to make sure that we're doing our job in passing\nThem forward promptly ah and I have found that process a little difficult\nSo how will you know when you see or a ... at some point you will see the results of the FBI's work how will you know that they've done a thorough investigation that you believe they should have\nWell to be clear of this is in the nature of a compromise Judy I'm if I were designing an FBI a follow up background investigation to the allegations against judge Kavanaugh it would last much longer it'd be much broader than what I suspect we'll be accomplished this week um but I asked\nA I implored my good friend and colleague Senator Jeff flake um last friday to consider a one week pause and to allow the FBI to investigate the allegations that we're right in front of us at that point um that's what I've worked hard in the last couple of days um to make sure happens\nThat's what I Believe a Republican senators are working to make happens\nAnd the FBI has a lot of resources and a lot of agents they're capable of pursuing parallel investigations are they should be able to interview dozens of people in a week\nUm but I don't know exactly how broad the scope will be and I'm not sure what will be in the final report that the Senate should receive this Friday\nUm and so some of them showed clips of the hearing from their class to have discussions some of them are\nAllowed students to live stream it ... and allowed some common ground zero yes um and then a lot of them are having conversations about how did we get to this moment I think there's a lot of assumptions among older adults about what\nThey're bringing to the table and and how they think about the Kavanaugh hearings we heard from a school in San Francisco that was having actually teach in on a need a hill and we're hearing schools talking about the gender imbalance in the Senate and some less controversial issues that aren't related to sex\nAnd consent that are related to say the separation of powers we've got all three branches at play here and there are some basic questions that students can talk about in their mind why is the Supreme Court so important why are so people people so emotional about it\nWhat does it mean when a party has control of the Senate what would it look like if this confirmation hearing were happening when the president and the Senate We're of different parties\nEvery blooded Education Week thank you thank you\n[noise]\nLet us first warn that the story
