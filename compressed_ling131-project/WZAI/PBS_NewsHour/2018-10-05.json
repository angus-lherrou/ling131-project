institutions and\nWas made possible by the corporation for public broadcasting and contributions to your PBS station\nWe were like [noise]\nThe results are in from the FBI report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and recent allegations of sexual assault and misconduct now a handful of senators have to decide congressional corresponded Lisa danger that begins our coverage [noise]\nOutside the Supreme Court some three thousand protesters demanded the Kavanaugh's nomination be rejected or\nAcross the street inside the Capitol senators troops to a secure room to read the FBI's report on the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh all eyes were on key voters like Arizona Republican Jeff Flake who helped force the reopening of the FBI probe\nI Know there are closely watched vote Susan Collins of Maine she said the new investigation appeared very thorough for his part President Trump tweeted that the allegations against Kavanaugh were totally uncorroborated but Democrats argued the reports resolved nothing Dianne Feinstein at the top Democrat on the Senate\nNotable part of this report is what's not in it\nIt looks to be a product of an incomplete investigation that was limited or perhaps why the White House\nLawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who's accused Kavanaugh sexually assaulting her in high school complained she and other witnesses were never in in a statement day to blamed the president saying those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth\nThere's more to the limits on\nMr Trump ignored shouted questions about the probe as he left the White House on a political trip but press secretary Sarah Sanders insisted the White House did not micromanage the process\nWe accommodated all of this and it's worth ... the president was very clear about that a and allow the FBI to make those decisions in an interview who they thought they needed to do so\nDemocrats also argued there's not enough time for all senators to view the documents before a key procedural votes tomorrow Virginia Senator Tim Kaine\nThere's now a report one on there and what is coming in for an hour long walks just what there's not a hundred hours between when they made it available they when they want to do the vote\nSo they don't want a hundred senators and not allowed to discuss a\nIs but one previously undecided Democrat in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp announced she will vote against confirming Kavanaugh and pressure mounted on others supporters of Kavanaugh's showed up at the office of Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski remains undecided\nAnd Lisa joins me now along with White House correspondent ... or so Lisa what do we know about this report what senator saying and is it changing any votes\nWe do the supplemental report itself with something like fifty pages or so and it included interviews with at least nine people and apparently the FBI reached out to at least attempt person who may not have spoken to them\nUm senators are not supposed to speak about it but I ... the whole Kavanaugh file is now about what should I care about this thing and they said and what happened in mind those closed doors you heard senator Kaine reference this\nSenators had to split up the supplemental interviews and pass them around one by one at one point they were had staff reading out loud the entire supplemental report\nI think in the end though I did not hear any senator indicate that what they found today's report if something substantially knew that is good news for Republicans who support Mr Kavanaugh but of course Democrats are complaining\nStacked in that direction from the gecko that's they're feeling so you ... what are they saying that the White House with the state of play there the\nWhite House and President Trump are very happy and they want this to happen quickly the fact that there was no new information seemingly innocence in the FBI investigation is not only good news for Republicans as Lisa said it's good news for the White House who was a little worried about what they could fight and Sarah Sanders today gave us a very vigorous defense of Brett Kavanaugh\nShe said that he's given more than any other nominee include it in and she was referring to his interview the documents that he handed over you should ... we're we're she's also referring to the testimony that he gave and really what you're saying there is that enough is enough\nBrett Kavanaugh needs to get a vote everyone should be able to just have an opinion right now\nI'm I was at the White House today when the president walked by our our reporters\nScreaming and and and really asking all these different questions I myself I wanted to ask him about mocking Dr Ford and whether or not he feels like he had the votes to confirm his nominee you didn't say anything to us but he did tweet as the president often does and what he said was this is a very important time in our country\nDue process fairness and common sense are now on trial so that the White House's take\nSo so you may have also been talking to the other side what our critics a of of Brett Kavanaugh and and defenders of of Christine Blasey Ford her legal team what are they saying\nThe number one complaint is it the the FBI should have done more they should've talked more people\nThey should have had more time to conduct an investigation everyone thinks that the White House or at least the the critics of this think that the White House somehow limit the FBI I'm told them that you can only speak to these people and don't speak to Dr Ford and don't speak to Brett Kavanaugh the White House of course vigorously denies that I'm an Dr Ford legal team put out\nA four page letter Tate I usually have been giving statements with a couple of paragraphs\nBut this is four pages and what they really are seeing and here is that there are number of people that the FBI should've talked to is that the FBI should've talked to the polygraph\nGraph examiner's talking and and really had him explain what the results that polygraph where they say that she passed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is that we hadn't basically heard about that\nHad relevancy to the to the issues at hand\nSo he weren't bothered that they've placed limits on the people that could talk to\nBut I I think the the question that have been raised was why weren't we having the judge and also a professor Ford once again review remember that\nIn this case as in all cases the FBI will do an investigation with a call three oh two which is\nBasic information asking about issues and and the uh the the accusation specific\nFor both a professor Ford and a a judge Kavanaugh went through literally hours and hours of testimony\nIn front of the individuals who are the decision makers which are the Judiciary Committee and for all of us to listen to that testimony which we not only for the listen to one so back to an review again and\nI suspect it will happen as I said look he's already gone through and we've had a chance to ask questions and doubled down with regard to the questions and concerns that senators have each of these two individuals\nWe know a senator that that a Dr Blass before contacted her member of Congress back in early July before\nA judge Kavanaugh had been named she contacted she reached out to uh when she thought he he was just under consideration she wanted to get the information across Democrats are now conceding that it may not have been handled\nVery well once the name was passed on to Congress but their point is once that information was out there\nIsn't there an obligation to explore it fully\nWe think it has been explored fully facts you are correct it was not handled writes ah he had made the short list and that's when apparently there in contact me\nThat data had been brought forward in a regular order if it has been discussed among the somebody like all of these traditionally are that information could have been vetted in those six weeks and which was hidden from basically the majority part of the committee and\nAnd on top of it when it was leaked and she was not given the information by her own attorney's apparently the committee would offer her a private discussion in California and she she didn't know anything about it\nThat really started ... made a lot of us think that this was there was some intent there there was not appropriate senator and I think that's still stands today\nExcuse me I Want to read to use something that judge Kavanaugh saddest part of his opening statement last week before the Judiciary Committee he said the accusations against him were part of an orchestrated political hit fueled with a parent pent up\nAnd on behalf of the Clintons do you believe Dr ... Ford was put up to this by Democrats who were out for revenge\nI I think professor Ford was probably not honored the way she should have been with a request by those individuals who saw political game\nTo begin with and I and I think\nAnd listening to her I felt very sorry for the position that she had been put in\nBut I also think you saw something else here and I I I read it this way 'cause I watch very carefully yes he expressed the real frustration that I think a lot of us in his position would have\nTo solve it was a man who was going to call balls and strikes you know we talked about him and his judicial temperament to begin with and said you're going to be a straight shooter he's gonna lay it out and what you found was a member didn't hide his feelings he said look you just through four balls buy me one of them you know this one here you're throwing up my head\nAnd he called it just exactly the way that he thought and so he expressed the frustration and anger that I think it was just um and\nFor for for professor forward this could have been done in a private setting it was ... she never got that information because somebody didn't deliver it to her and it wasn't the folks who are responsible for operating the committee that didn't do that\nSenator I hear you just finally very quickly former Justice John Paul Stevens in an interview today said he wants thought Brett Kavanaugh did have the qualifications to serve on the court based on his record but he said watching him and the hearings changed his mind he said senator should pay attention to that\nWell I I I think a lot of us did and that's part of the responsibility that we have is just as in ... and we were there we watched it\nBut there's something else as well and that is as we still have three hundred cases the judge Kavanaugh has issued rulings on that we can go back and look at it shows a lot about judicial determination judicial judge but it's been well respected over an extended period of time\nWhat you're finding right now is that I'm a man who was attacked his family has been attacked you've been through a process that literally I think when it's all said and done I think he's going to have a huge respect\nFor the value of someone who is innocent [noise]\nTo have the right to be innocent until such time as he is proven guilty\nIf nothing else I think that has been seared into his mind for forever more if it wasn't there already\nSenator Mike rounds thank you very much\nAnd we had a Democrats take now from Senator Patty Murray of Washington state she is the highest ranking woman\nHer earlier this evening [noise]\nSenator Patty Murray thank you very much for joining us or Republicans are moving ahead with this vote on judge Kavanaugh they say this FBI report provides no corroboration for these for any of these allegations what did you see in the report\nFor duty obviously I Can't talk about exactly what's in the report but I can tell you that I Am so frustrated and disappointed that it was a very narrow scope if there's one thing we have learned about allegations of sexual assault\nIs that it often takes a long time for someone to come forward and tell someone about it or to be able to remember all the details of it they often just remember a few things that Dr Ford herself very um\nShowed us last week and a very emotional way and to not speak to the people\nThat she has said to talk to 'em really says to me that this is not a thorough investigation and it really is an attempt to sweep just under the rug and move on and that is such a disservice to the nominee to us as the country and the women who are victims of sexual assault well the white\nHouse and Republicans a Senator Grassley are saying this was a thorough investigation they were saying they followed all the lead that were related to the sexual assault allegations\nBrazilian soy farm or ... non knows who he's voting\nFor on Sunday ... wants to be able to pick the maybe that maybe we will manage to get a Trump here to set this country ... by the\nHe's referring to a presidential candidate ... an arrow a right wing populist leading in the polls is often referred to as Brazil's Donald\nTrump both narrow known for his divisive attacks on women blacks homosexuals an indigenous communities became the victim of the same violence he promises to be tough on and he was stabbed at a campaign rally on September ...
