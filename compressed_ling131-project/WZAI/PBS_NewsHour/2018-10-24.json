I was more than seven thousand migrants mostly Honduran woke this morning to continue the journey north one though and when we heard the Caribbean was coming we joined this is an opportunity to improve my family's life\nVoters reporter dumping shrank is traveling with the group and described it as less of a caravan and more of an accident because they're\nReal next or I mean I I I the majority are fairly young up but it's like it's a complete mixture of men women and lots of children people have various ages\nCaravans like this had been organized for more than a decade of group migration built on the principle of safety in numbers and health along the way by nonprofit like ...\nEarlier this spring a smaller caravan of around Fifteen hundred left southern Mexico only a few hundred ultimately sought asylum in the U.S [noise] shrinks says this group came together much more spontaneously and at the migrants she's talked you are more concerned with what they're leading in where they end up\nOver and over I heard from thousands of migrants you say the same thing that\nNo matter how cruel or how difficult a welcome at the United states for the the overwhelming need they feel to see a mixture of fighting corruption unemployment political idea as they get in on you're really in what way modest upon them on\nPresident Trump's escalating rhetoric like at this Texas rally last night has brought this year's caravans to the forefront of the immigration debate two weeks out of the mid term elections\nYou know what's happening right now as a large group of people to go take care of\nIt [noise] I think the Democrats have something to do and I think we made a big risk\nMeanwhile the migrants continue their journey mostly on flood and now over a thousand miles from the nearest us border crossing\nPicking it up from there to discuss some of the rhetoric and policy surrounding all of this is Alan Gomez he's an immigration reporter for USA Today Alan Gomez welcome back\nTo the news hour we heard the president there in Texas last night but I Want to ask you about something he said a little earlier today in the oval office he was asked about a couple of allegations he's made about the caravan\nHe has said that there are members of the gang and as Thirteen and as he put it middle Easterners traveling in that caravan here's what the president said about that earlier today\nCertainly you have people coming up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country\nAnd Tom not letting them and they're not coming in and they're not coming and we're going to do whatever we have to they're not coming\nAlan Gomez what do you make about what the president is alleging there is there any validity to that claim\n[noise] not that his administration can point to as of yet um we've been asking the department of homeland security ever since he started making those claims in a series of tweets um what were the proof was that there were members of gangs criminals um as he refers to them just generally is middle Easterners\nIn the group and they haven't been able to point out any examples or any proof that anybody exists\nInstead what they're doing is they're falling back on percentages um they've been passing out data of the number of criminals gang members and people from quote special interests countries\nWho have been caught trying to cross the border illegally over the past year um when you put those numbers in the context that shows that about five percent of people caught along the border\nUm or have some kind of criminal background about zero point three percent are gang members and about zero point eight percent come from special interest countries that include some Middle Eastern countries um but so they're saying the numbers indicate that there has to be in that group and vice president\nPence made that same claim that it's if you look at the size of this there just has to be some of those folks in there I'm In the last hour we've heard from the department of homeland security that they are confirming that there are some criminals and some middle Easterners in there or we followed up with them but I haven't heard anything back\nYou know the president's focused on this specific heritage is elevated it's a dancer leaders and Karen and in the past one earlier this year ... you know in the entire immigration landscape which covers so deeply why this has this one event caught\n[noise] timing where just about two weeks away from the election\nAnd basic this falls into his rhetoric so perfectly um these is basically taking a page out of his twenty sixteen a presidential campaign and just riling up on immigration right now this was an issue that hit that the twenty sixteen the election proved\nIs one that will rile up his base is one that appeals to them as one that interests them um is one that scares them\nUm and so the timing of this the idea that for the next two weeks because this caravan will it's a slow march they're walking or still well over a thousand miles away from the border\nThe fact that these images will be aired on TV repeatedly for these next two weeks\nIs perfect for him because it shows this idea of an invasion as he likes to call it I've been watching a congressional debates around the country and house districts in small in states like Idaho Iowa Minnesota and in in Pittsburgh in the north east you hear the Honduran caravan coming up repeatedly\nBecause it's something that Republicans realize it's something that can Energizer base\nAlan Gomez of USA Today of Congress immigration there are going to have to leave it there thank you very much for your time [noise]\n\n\nPresident Trump's comments about that immigrant caravan during a rally last night in Houston were seized upon by fact checkers including at the Toronto Star newspaper\nThey've tracked over twenty nine hundred claims the president is made since he took office almost two years ago that cannot be borne out by facts that is more than four false claims a day on average\nAnnual Dale is the Washington bureau chief for the Toronto Star and he joins me now thank you for being thank you Daniel Daniel you've covered the White House closely and I know there's been attention paid to what the president says it at a remarks that cannot be borne out by facts since he took office but you've observed that there's more of this taking place now\nYeah we've we've quantified it and so in twenty Seventeen he average two point nine false claims per day\nAs of now it's four point five false claims per day so it was more than five per day in twenty teens and it escalated even further as we've gotten closer to the mid turned so every successive month June July August and September set a new record for the president's false claims so over time he's getting more dishonest\nUm this started out her interview just now are asking about the presidents\nIn that migrant caravan we heard uh uh the reporter Alan Gomez say there's no evidence of that but there are other comments the president's made about immigration for example he's talked about Democrats paying to get that migrant caravan started at Democrats in the United states\nHe's made the statement is there any evidence of this\nNo I'm I'm comfortable calling that alive there's simply no validity there is no basis for that whatsoever\nAnd I should say we at the news hour uh talk about inaccurate statements false statements you're comfortable using the word lie why\nBecause I think that's the only accurate word for some of the claims he makes I\nAlso sometimes described his claims as false claims\nSometimes we don't know if he's a confused if he's been innocent air but in other cases it's clear that he simply fabricated something for example he claimed at one point that the head of the boy scouts had called him and said that his speech to the boy scouts was the best speech ever given to the boy scout ... the boy scouts told me no one ever spoke to him no one ever called him no one ever said that\nAnd so in a case like that I think in our in our regular lives I think the word we would use his life so I think we as journalists should use it in articles as well\nAnother couple of comments the president's made about immigration he spoke and just I think just last night again about\nA he said illegal immigrants in California are voting or in the ah in this upcoming a midterm election in California or is there evidence that this is going on and early voting in California\nYou know there was no evidence for this and this is the claim that the president has made about about elections in general and it's something he said since his own election that despite what everyone says what every expert says illegal immigrants are voting on mass he simply knows this and again this in my view is alive there is no evidence for whatsoever\nBottom line should Americans come away from this I'm a depressed discouraged about the future I Want a war zone hopeful\nI I Do both but I Want us to be sober and realistic about what we need to rebuild we're going through a revolution that through the digital revolution which is akin to urbanization and industrialization there was also a crisis of loneliness and that time\nWhich created prohibition as a response right now we're gonna have the third year of declining life expectancy in a row in the U.S because of deaths of despair that stuff didn't come from government and it primary mostly can't be fixed by government but we the people still have to do that and there's a lot we can rebuild in our neighborhoods and in our\nNew healthier tech habits for this new digital age\nOne blueprint a is here the book as them why we hate each other and how to heal and events Hassan ... thank you very much like ooh Judy [noise]\n\nNow to the latest battle over Obamacare or the federal health care law formerly known as the Affordable CARE Act the Trump Administration announced yesterday that it will allow states to go ahead with the sale of cheaper and scan the our health insurance plans\nTo cover preexisting conditions something that had previously been a legal requirement of Obamacare and as William Bram tells us that could play right into a major election fight over that issue\nYesterday the Trump Administration gave states new flexibility with their health care plans allowing them to use federal subsidies for cheaper plans that come with fewer required benefits for example they can no subsidized plans or don't have to cover prescription drugs or mental health or maternity care all things that the Affordable CARE Act required\nIn these plans could also denied coverage to people with preexisting conditions as long as consumers still had access to another more comprehensive plan that guarantees that coverage\nThis sounds like small changes but they're not and they will take effect starting twenty twenty President Trump and many Republicans contend with these new options are exactly what some consumers want\nBut this comes as support for parts of Obamacare or growing in at least one poll recently found a majority of voters say healthcare is very important in making their decisions come November Margot singer cats covers all this for the New York times and she joins me now will come back\nYou for having me so help us understand what the Trump Administration announced yesterday what are these changes and what do they mean so\nThis is something that was always an Obamacare there is a provision that allows states to apply to do a totally different system if they want but they have to\nAdhere to certain guard rails to make sure that they're not taking coverage away from people who would have otherwise gotten it and the Trump Administration put out new rules for that process where they basically said\nWe're going to be much more open minded about letting states throw out all the Obamacare roles and come up with their own way of managing their insurance marketplaces so this could include allowing plans that cover fewer benefits maybe don't cover prescription drugs are mental health care\nUp they also including plans that maybe are not available to people with preexisting conditions are not available to them at the same price as for other customers and all kinds of other changes you know maybe the\nWho gets a subsidy for what could change so we don't know what states are going to do but states are not welcome to bring these proposals forward and the Trump Administration has said that they are open to approving them\nAnd there's the concern that if federal subsidies now can be seen as another encouragement to people to buy these plans that people might be getting a plan that they think covers them but then when a crisis it's they don't really have coverage\nI think there are too concerned than they are both important so one is just that that people may buy a plan and are healthy when they buy it and they don't really understand the fine print and they think that that plan and then from their kid gets an illness or they develop cancer\nWhen they realized they need those benefits that they're not there so there is that concern that these plans to cover the were things that have more exclusions could have holes for individual consumers and then I think there's a broader concern which is\nThat kind of cheaper plan that covers last that might be good for someone who is healthy and never has any health conditions and was never going to use their health insurance any way\nBut for someone who has a pre existing illness they're never going to buy that plan it's not going to be available for them it's not going to cover the benefits that they need and so what does it sets up these two side by side markets where all of the people with preexisting conditions by\nThe sort of comprehensive Obamacare plans and a lot of healthier people are willing to roll the dice on these cheaper plans\nAnd what can happen is that because the way insurance works as we're sort of all pooling our premiums together to cover our collective health bills people one pull over here where all the sick people are and another one over here with all the healthy people\nAt the price for buying insurance for sick people could get really really high and that could make it unaffordable for a lot of people who really need insurance the most\nAs we've seen there are people over the country who are struggling to pay their bills my colleagues wrote an article recently met a young woman who is because we can afford healthcare and she's desperate ... she'd be ideal customer for cheaper maybe ... you're listening to what you have to say\nI absolutely would try again for health insurance and actually every year when the enrollment comes up I Try hoping for a miracle that there's going to be a plan I can\nAfford I I've never given up I Try every year and and then every year it hasn't worked out so absolutely I Would I Would look at it again and if there's plans out as early as next week I'll I'll look into it next week\nI mean this was a real issue for a lot of people\nReally hasn't I talked to these people all the time it is true that Obamacare made health insurance a lot more affordable for\nLow and middle income people made it more accessible for people with part illnesses\nFor a lot of people who make what we would consider to be middle class incomes don't qualify for a subsidy his insurance plans can be really expensive and they can be unaffordable and we know that those people have been dropping out of the market and they're going without anything and so I think that policymakers and the Trump Administration are trying to be sensitive to the population and say okay maybe these\nSkimpy or plans aren't quite as good don't have all the same consumer protections and benefits as an a bomb a care plan but if people are choosing between us and nothing isn't it better to give them some things in the air and let them decide what's the right plan for them\nConsumer advocates I think on the other hand are very concerned about people sort of falling through the cracks and again about the segmentation at the market but I think that you know this person in Idaho is really speaking to a real problem that we see in the country\nWhy it out of reach for a lot of people\nOn a separate but related issue the issue of preexisting conditions has become nationally a very big political issue in the lead up to the terms on\nA show you to excerpts of some ads that are running in Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill and her opponent\nOr injury Josh Hawley took a look at these\nTwo years ago I beat breast cancer\nThousands of other women in Missouri I don't talk about it much but those who face cancer and many other illnesses have a pre existing condition when it comes to health coverage unfortunately Josh Hawley filed the lawsuit letting insurance companies deny coverage for those with preexisting conditions\nThat's just wrong earlier this year we learned our oldest has a rare chronic conditions we know what the ... or support for an insurance company to go all the conditions\nCoated preexisting conditions becomes such a big issue in the midterm elections I think\nThe real answer as Obamacare appeal so as you may recall over the last two political cycles Republicans have really right on the message that they want to repeal and replace Obamacare which would get rid of coverage for pre existing\nThat was a really important part of Obamacare it's not the only way that you can take care of these people but it's the way that we do it now in our law\nAnd when Republicans got really serious about repealing Affordable Care act last year I think that suddenly this law that had been very controversial and had been pretty unpopular\nPeople started to suddenly look at it differently and we saw in the public opinion polls for the first time that more people supported the Affordable CARE Act and want it repealed and that is a shift that has persisted and we saw a lot of engagement by kind of democratic activists by disease advocacy group of people who are lobbying on the hill organizing at home\nAnd it has become this really central issue for Democrats to say you know we passed the Affordable CARE Act where suddenly proud of it and we're going to protect people with preexisting conditions you look around the country this is the number one issue for Democrats there are more ads on health care than any other subject\nPolling has consistently shown that health care is if not the most important issue the second most important issue to voters both in battleground states and all around the country\nAnd I think Republicans now are kind of floundering a little bit to find what their answer is going to be to this problem\nAnd we see a lot of ads now and statements from Republican candidates like Josh Hawley fad where Republican candidates even those who have voted for the Obamacare repeal propose on a hill or who like Josh Hawley are part of a lawsuit\nAfter the courts that they are saying no no I'm Still committed to pre existing conditions\nI think it's a little bit\nHard to believe what they're saying even though I think there are possible ways that they could achieve that because they have not been very specific about how they would do it and we have them on the record as being opposed to the way that Democrats have achieved it\nAll right Margot singer cats as always thank you very much\n...
