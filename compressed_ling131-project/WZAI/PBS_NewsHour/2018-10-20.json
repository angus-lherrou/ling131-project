citizen a woman there is accused of managing finances for a social media campaign to spread distrust about American policy debates and candidate more details on our top story let's turn to Nina Jack with us\nPart of the think tank here in Washington need a jacket with welcome back to the program so we've heard again and again the Russians interfered succeeded in interfering twenty sixteen they're still at it what's new in this complaint well I think\nWhat's new is that we have hard evidence now that they're interfering on all all sides of the issue all sides of the political spectrum I think that's really important for Americans to know going into the elections in two weeks that this is not a partisan issue it's an issue about attacking our democracy and clearly the Justice Department wanted to put that out there\nBefore we go to the polls because in a way this can be confusing I mean it was we were told and twenty sixteen with the Russians were up to and and the people who've been indicted so far by the special counsel Robert Mueller having people who seem to be working on behalf of President Trump but this this has people as you say on all sides of some of these\nYeah exactly we've seen pro uh Robert Mueller tweets an anti ... and Robert Mueller tweets we have seen\nUh things that say voter fraud is a felony we have also seen a\nOrganization of rallies that ah the Russians have supported where resistance folks would turn out in front of the White House for a flash mob on July Fourth so these are on all sides of the political spectrum and this is exactly the tactic that Russia has he has time and time again not only here in the United states but across Eastern Europe\nAnd I want to look I mean just as an example and I think we have a a graphic of this a voter fraud this was a tweet about voter fraud a it's a felony hold them accountable fight fight fight and then real Donald Trump ... now that is a an argument one does here from Republican uh-huh mhm absolutely\nBut it's again this is a desire to so chaos and dismay is is a a time to tried and true Russian tactic and the idea there is just to turn off and we're going to get us to fight amongst each other so that we are less focused on what Russia's doing on the international stage\nThere's also interesting information in here and you know Jack was about the ... about the financing this woman appears to be an accountant yeah in Russia it doesn't appear they'll ever be able to extradite her to the United states in the face these charges\nRight it's it's extremely interesting to know that over three years they've spent at least thirty five million dollars on advertising\nOn domains and proxies on a on the payment of actual activists again which is it's staggering a statistic and if you look at what for instance the global engagement center of the center that's a created to fight this information at the state department state of budget of sixty million dollars for a single year\nBut their hands on and that was for countering state propaganda worldwide um that was directed toward\nThe United states the Ukraine and interestingly also within the Russian Federation and as you mentioned you you mentioned that flash mob people actually showed up for that I literally and and this isn't the first time we've seen activists show up to Russian organized or supported events like this\nBut I think it's important to know that this is this is not just an abstract social media campaign this is changing people's behavior and the discourse surrounding the election\nAnd you were telling me what you noted here is how much it says that the special counsel and his office now know about\nThis absolutely yeah yeah it's a staggering level of detail ah I don't know what that means for the future but I think it it it's an important issue for our our democracy heading into the midterms are it's not a partisan issue and I would hope that politicians on on all sides of the aisle uh begin to understand that an advocate for solutions that are non partisan to it as well\n[noise] manage ankle with with the Wilson Center we thank you for having me [noise]\nAnd that is other
