like them all involved in this operation there were pictures of some security officers who may have been to the security detail from time to time but this is normal\nTurkish officials have kept up pressure by releasing the hit squads names and passports men identified by Saudi experts as royal guard special forces intelligence an air force officers\nAnd Turkish officials say after the murder the Saudis called NBS is private office and his brother the Saudi ambassador to the u._s. it's inconceivable that Mohammed bin ... didn't know that longtime Saudi offender Republican Senator Lindsey Graham at it and possibly\nSo go after him and his inner circle said the alliance I don't mind military sales but I cannot do business with the current leadership NBS uh\nHe's done to make the Senate Foreign relations Sherman Bob Corker spoke on CNN\nI don't think anybody believes that story I can understand the president wanting to keep open channels um but I think those of us who who want to speak directly to this no that is just not credible\nThe international reaction is equally withering German Chancellor on hold and Merkel called for suspending Saudi arms sales but\nThere is an urgent need to clarify what happened we're far from this having been cleared up and those responsible held to account after initially calling Saudi Arabia's story credible today President Trump said he wasn't satisfied and was waiting for U.S intelligence team to investigate\nThe fact that I devoured [noise] and I will not first soon as I Am not satisfied with whatever\nBut in Riyadh today treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin Mitt NBS and in a CNN for President Trump's senior adviser and son in law Jared Kushner urge everyone not to jump to conclusions\nWere obviously getting as many facts as as we can from the different places and that will determine which facts are are credible and\nBut there's more pressure on Saudi Arabia today than at any point since nine eleven in part because this has been made personal this weekend has shrunk jeeze fiance posted a video of him on Twitter introducing himself until\nThey took your bodily presence she wrote you a beautiful laugh remain in my soul forever [laughter]\nI'll take a closer look at the effects of all this on us Saudi relations after the news some right\nIn the days other news Russia warned of counter measures if the U.S withdraws from the Cold War era nuclear arms treaty the Nineteen eighty seven pac man the two sides from having medium range ground launch missiles\nPresident Trump announced Saturday that the U.S will quit the agreement he charged again today that Russia has violated the terms will have a full report on that later in the program\nA growing caravan of Central American migrants pushed deeper into southern Mexico today despite new warnings from President Trump he declared that he will slash foreign aid for El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras or failing to stop the migrants\nI doubt if there were any changes at the center of Saudi decision making even right now that there would be a serious a redefinition of the Saudi American relationship\nThe more dangerous situation is if there is no change in a in Saudi Arabia the pressures from Congress from public opinion and other international pressures could force the United states to take its distance from Saudi Arabia I think that that's the bigger threat right now\nUh to be more specific Senator Lindsey Graham\nIn policy toward Saudi Arabia by the MPs has to go I think he said MPs are is done for me or that something that the U.S administration the government should be pushing Saudi Arabia to deliver the message that NBS has called done for the U.S\nI think it's really dangerous for the United states to start dictating who's in who's out I think one of the mistakes the Trump Administration made was being extremely public in its patronage of Mohammed bin ...\nAre extremely supportive of his rise to crown prince and publicly claiming credit for it and I think that that tied the administration much too much to one person within the Saudi ruling family\nI think that that there has to be some kind of of communication from Washington a senior person whom the Saudis trust we don't have an ambassador there now but a very senior person somebody like former secretary of state James Baker I think has to go and talk to the king about the way forward in us Saudi relations\n[noise] honestly uh the way forward and us Saudi relations also runs through on camera\nRight now I'm a the president or red tide aired on is going to announce a the findings of the Turkish investigation tomorrow or do you have any sense that what he announces will be a eliminated or or or rather taken by U.S officials\nAll right I'm told that honestly can't hear me All right Greg ... can I can I turn to you for that question then so are those ... control some of the next steps that the U.S has to take\nI think everyone has played this like a Stradivarius he's been a statesman and he wants to preserve a relationship with Saudi Arabia as he's facing his own economic problems\nBut he's allowed his press to to leak these are the information out drip drip to make the Saudis look bad the background of this is it the Saudis and the Turks really don't see eye to eye on what the future of the region should be\nA president ... very supportive of the Arab uprisings of Tony eleven very supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Saudis very very nervous about any kind of bottom up politics so there's a rivalry between ... and re odd that I think is underlying a president air to one's behavior here\n[noise] Enron the flame do you believe that a air to one's behavior really is going to make a difference when it comes to us Saudi relationship\n[noise]\nNo I think and the guy a real good shape phone with both the Americans and the ... and I think to see it is that the Saudis and that can switch thought shaping with each other and\nMen he would like to get some decided these by many financial yeah the number of the men do when you're dealing with domestic agenda he would like to get from the U. S. for example\nThe issue of the hulk back which is a major financial institution turkey facing billions of dollars in us find foot it's alleged violation of a sanctions against us sanctions against you know who would like those flights to be either scrapped or to be minimized the there's also the issue between the United states and turkey on the ...\nIn eastern Syria he would like also to hurt gosh out in the U.S\nWith northern Syria yeah\nIt could act good at and that and that relationship between the forces end up you idea has been promising relationship as far as ... as soon as you would like to\nMake sure that this has put under certain kinds of ... that you can live with a weekend accept so they're on a number of negotiations that at the gun would like to engage in with both of these companies and I think that's what's it what's\nIn my opinion taking place at the moment and tomorrow it's when it's going to see whether he's going to be in the whole naked truth as he has promised to do or ...\n... ... ...\n[noise]\n\n\nAs we reported earlier the President Trump has announced his intention to pull the United states out of a landmark Cold War nuclear weapons trading struck Thirty years ago with the Soviet Union so what would the effect of that be and is the treaty outdated as the president claims\nHe was Nineteen eighty seven and President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev celebrity mediate range nuclear forces treaty as common cold war tension [noise]\nFlash forward to this past weekend and President Trump's decision to abandon it\nWere the ones that are stated the rivers and we bonded river for Russia is not on the river so we're going to German or they were going to pull out\nThe IMF scrap thousands of ground launch nuclear and conventional missiles [noise]\nRanges from three hundred and thirty four hundred miles but in twenty four teen then President Obama accused Russia of developing and testing a cruise missile in violation of the treaty Sunday President Trump echoed that charge\nThe added to the agreement it's a threat to whoever you watch the edited flew out of the word Russia edited words that everybody else wants to play the game you can do that you can't play that game on\nThe Russians deny violating the pack and claimed that it is the U.S breaching the treaty with the Europe based missile defense system it has built [noise] Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov condemned Mr Trump's announcement Lavrov said last night\nThat he wants answers from us national security adviser John Bolton who is in Moscow this week\nWe'll wait for an official explanation for more U.S colleagues increase John Bolton was ready to give them rule of course listen to him and assess the situation after the\nFor his part former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev set in a statement that quote it can't be that hard to understand the discarding such agreements is narrow minded French President Emmanuel Macron's\nOffice said he to voice misgivings in a Sunday phone call with President Trump we asked\nWhether the president has made the right decision to withdraw from the nuclear arms treaty and for answers we turn to Richard Burt he was assistant secretary of state for Europe and then served as US ambassador to Germany during the Nineteen eighties even intimately involved with the original I N F trading negotiations\nIs now managing partner at the consulting firm ... associates and Rebecca Heinrich she was a legislative assistant focusing on foreign and defense policy for a Republican member of Congress she's now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute a think tank in Washington\nAnd we welcome both of you to the news hour Rebecca hunger is to first and you ah have told us you think the president's doing the right thing by trying saying he wants to pull out why\nWell this treaty I'm a Cold War treaty the Russians had been in violation of the treaty for many years as early as two thousand eight\nThe Obama administration made clear in two thousand fourteen that the Russians were in violation of the treaty and began the soft diplomatic approach to try to get the Russians to comply with the treaty\nThey did not that they started a moving forward with deploying um uh missiles that would violate the treaty\nUm and and so the Trump Administration came in and try to tougher approach tried to get them to comply to no avail and so it's time you know that the arms control what's going to mean anything it has to be enforced and so it undermines arms control in general if there aren't hard consequences for violations\nRichard if the Russians are in violation why should the U.S stand\nWell this isn't the first time that we've accused the Russians of being in violation and I think in this case they are clearly in violation of the agreement but we've had other major compliance problems in a number of different treaties this is the first time we've actually left a treaty when are we haven't been capable of resolving issue I don't think\nThe Trump Administration in taking this decision it went the extra mile in actually trying to solve this problem I think uh the the public diplomacy of this issue is just as important as substance\nAnd the problem is is that people should be blaming the Russians but they're not as by virtue of this to us decision the United states is being blamed for stepping out of a very important arms control agreement and our allies see another example of American unilateralism\nWhat about uh Rebecca Heinrich what about to his point that the Trump Administration didn't do enough to try to bring Russia into compliance\nThat that the ... and I did try and hats and working with allies and President Trump took office the Obama administration was working quietly with allies to try to get that\nI'm trying to put pressure on the Russians\nAnd you know enough is enough to get to the point the other issue that's happening as while the Russians are in violation and continuing to become more provocative in their violations\nThen you also had this other issue which is that other countries like China\nIran North Korea or not party to the eye and treaty she also had a problem of relevance is the treaty relevant at combined with this issue of Russia's violations if the other countries like China or going to be developing these missiles to than the United states doesn't want to be tied to a treaty of what you did the only one abiding by it\nPreviously they would have been that knowledge and that comfort that an agency like health and Human Services would have been a place that they could turn to have those rights vindicated and now if this kind of proposal would it be put into place in essence the doors will be closed in their face\nNow fortunately there are organizations like land legal who continue to defend the rights of the ... community but it's extremely important to recognize the deep deep harm that is being done by trying to basically create an outcast group of citizens in this country\nThis memo was credit to a man and Roger Severino he's at the civil rights department it changes in prior to joining the Trump Administration she was at a think tank and she was very critical of the Obama administration's moves\nAnd he said that they were intended to quote impose a new definition of what it means to be a man or woman on the entire nation they called them Wallace what do you make of that criticism\nI think that it is noteworthy that we're seeing this kind of policy change from someone like Roger Serino he clearly was selected for this position in part because\nThere is a desire to promote his world view but the suggestion that this is a a a response to lawlessness I I Would just point to the fact that when attorney general holder back in twenty fourteen announced that the Justice Department would be interpreting federal law\nThey multi page case Laden document and when Jeff Sessions last year rescinded that memo there were barely any legal citations at all\nThey're all just one case in Texas where the the a federal district court judge said the Obama administration citing Congress's title nine categorization do seem to push back and said that there was some justification of your woman mister she had overreached and somewhat\nYes so this judge judge O'Connor in Texas has become sort of the the go to court for individuals who are looking to strike down aspects of the Obama administration's\nA accomplishments protecting transgender people\nBut his decision is truly an outlier in the face of decades of case law in which Republican and democratic appointed judges awake are recognizing that discrimination against the trench into individual is just as much a form of sex discrimination as it is religious discrimination to penalize them for having converted from one religion to another\nThere are many cases out there that actually sort of go through not only sort of that logical argument but also the scientific basis for understanding that your gender identity is as much a part of who you are as other aspects of your sex that have clearly been held that protected against sex discrimination whether it's non conforming appearance\nWhether it's other ways in which you don't necessarily conform with your employers idea about how men or women are supposed to act in the workplace\nSo this is truly is the lawless action that we're seeing right now a disregard of case law that this administration doesn't like\nTo be able to achieve an outcome that is the world that they want to live in\n[noise] sure I'm going to legal thank you very much thank you for having me [noise]\nWhat American voters head to the polls in two weeks Democrats are

Republican House members in this county represent districts Hillary Clinton won in twenty six team that makes this place ground zero for Democrats trying to win control of Congress\n[noise] Orange County his you know rising number of Asian residence demographics alone don't explain the changing politics\nOr according to Amy Walter the cook Political Report in what is helping a Democrat in this kind of year is the fact that so many suburban white college educated women really do not like Donald Trump\nThe geo peace still has nearly forty thousand more registered voters the Democrats that
