mean minimum wage jobs\nAnd he's fared little criticism for many of his fellow Democrats who he does have forgotten about West Virginia let's go ahead and start\nAbout why Democrats lost power you know why because they suck\nThey got to the point where they were in office for so long and you know what people finally got\nTired of it and they got kicked to the curb\nThese talks like them he dresses like them or an expressive the anger that they feel\nMy plant is a longtime democratic strategist based in Charleston\nFor Democrats to reach across and and get enough Republicans to be successful or vice versa you know you have to be seen as somebody who's not part of the political establishment that people have lost confidence in\nBrandon Blankenship understands that appeal he grew up in a staunchly conservative family and has been a Republican all his life but after running into oh Jetta at a restaurant and talking to him for an hour Blankenship decided to vote for him\nEven if I don't agree with everything that he says that means more to me that you do I need you to believe and what you're saying not just say it because you think it's what people want to hear he believes what he was saying\nUnless they're forced to by law\nAll of a sudden a Republicans are coming up all over the board across the country with individual stories how they had a child or nephew or or brother or sister right sick and they never they never we feel is so I really think quite to the contrary\nI I think the Democrats have shown on characteristic discipline and ... it's been all over there's been no seem at this Republican putting so he disagrees with you\nA ... you know I'm not going to say it's him but it's going to be a Republican either I'm not saying that uh but I Do think people tend to vote on on values and I do think identity issues and so what we've seen is on in the areas where frankly Trump is culturally repulsive\nThe Democrats really wrote very well but to me the Democrats had a historic opportunity to win them over a lot of sensors places make some inroads in some red places where a lot of people just don't like the kind of a gym and are they not probably can lead to all of a sudden it there's a chance they may actually lose subset of seats\nAnd so to me this was a potentially ... election because you know the president was phenomenally unpopular and by running on the big spending versus tax cuts were back to normal\nLikely to be a little more fifty fifth well speaking of tax cuts I Want to share with all of you this is a this is a look at the New Jersey Senate race they had a debate or this week are ... are down was one of the\nEr the moderator she helped moderate it here's an example of the exchange between the incumbent Senator Bob Menendez and his Republican challenger let's listen\nTo Jersey is so over tax I go all around the state I don't mean one person says taxes are too low New Jersey everyone says overtime and when you pay your tax bill\nRemember senator Menendez has voted for over five hundred tax increases in his tenure including increasing taxes on your Social Security check\nWhat we shouldn't have is a two trillion dollar tax bill that my opponent supports and that he helped the person who drove the tax bill being office the president of the United states Donald Trump\nAnd now that they have two trillion dollars unpaid for what's the Republican leader of the Senate say as soon as this election is over we have to go after entitlements Medicare Medicaid Social security\nAs you see as I've gotten it Mr ... who is a Republican or a candidate challenging Bob Menendez mark a they did come back to taxes is one of the things you know David Was just saying\nIs not is not terribly effective going to be terribly effective for Democrats this year\nYou know I mean I think that the New Jersey race I think has to be understood\nThat bought bought them and then does the Democrat in a state if when Democrats talk about winning back the house the three Keystone cornerstone\nTo that strategy or California, Pennsylvania New Jersey where the Democrats I'd add to it today Iowa possibly but I mean those are the states where the Democrats going to pick up the majority of their seats so the fact that the race is close\nIs is a reflection or anything else on not simply the Republican challenges campaign where he's been very deep pocketed\nA and run a ... a very strong campaign but Bob Menendez is it'd be a recall had a a a a a hung jury on his own a a conspiracy an a corruption charges\nAnd I think that that's what this race is about more than more than any national issues I just say to David\nPreexisting conditions is a value gay that uh you know it is it it isn't just you know whether we're going to French kiss after the prom if the value of you know health care health care for people who can't afford it is a value it's a real bad you\nThis is a family show I just wanted to remind sorry I'm Sorry [laughter]\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nLater Medicare entitlements that's a debate we've been having since Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty or maybe Nineteen fifty six\nTo me Trump does represent a shift in how we view politics is no longer that debate is a central it's much more what do we think about immigration what do we think about America's role in the world and it's more open closed less big government versus small government and it takes a little while for the other a lot of other races to adapt to this new field but I Do think Trump\nAnd the global populace around the world have really changed the terms of debate and what we just heard there\nCould have been set an example is thirty or forty years\nMark I mean the point is he he's changing the polls at basically the political polls mark ... LA not Paul\nYeah no no no question Judy and and twenty twelve and Mitt Romney was a Republican nominee there was a widespread consensus of immigration is an issue Republicans were essentially the Republican position was that they were from Wall liberalized immigration\nPerhaps the Democrats were who are concerned about immigrants are representing threats on an hourly jobs\nBut at the same time it's only four percent of Republicans considered a top issue\nThis is now Donald Trump's party twenty three percent of Republicans now consider this the top issue in twenty Eighteen that is Donald Trump's party that isn't the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan or the Republican Party of George W. Bush the Republican Party and Mitt Romney are so ... Davis right there is a change or Donald Trump\nWhen you when this races about him he he I Will say this\nWe have seen I think probably the last press conference with Sarah Huckabee Sanders has the press secretary not reflects on her Donald Trump is now the press voice of this administration you may have noticed that the White House now he's the one\nWho holds the press conferences and holds hostage Democratic senators who happened to be standing there at the same time uh but that this is this is written produced and directed this administration this government\nBy Donald Trump we come back to the to the same to that point David\nYeah and he you know you see how it goes back to the caravan again and again that an issue like made to order for them to me it's an exaggeration I mean we've had\nRefugees come to this country before we haven't had a national crisis over we haven't had to send down the national guard we would've process these things were a country of three hundred and thirty million people we can handle if it's two thousand and if they really are refugees who needs protection if we can handle it but that's not healthy\nInvasion of the hordes from barbarian you know some are and so uh that is that's the issue for them\nRight now [noise] and on that now we're going to thank you both David Brooks Marshall thank you thank you\n[noise]\n\nNext are false film series continues tonight what they had it's a story of a family coming to terms with the mothers oncoming all timers Jeffrey Brown has our luck\nSit in Chicago what they had the story of a family coping as their mother begins to suffer from Alzheimer's\nIs known for years you got to be when you want a new one moment in time because on one of the ...\nFirst time director Elizabeth ... co wrote the screenplay based on her own family experience\nI was devastated by my grandmother's diagnosis just because she was someone I so looked up to insult so close to and um and really assume that that would be the sort of end of her personality in the end of her spirit\nThe film opens with the elderly Ruth played by life Danner wandering out into the night Nikki putting when she's gone daughter Bridget played by two time Oscar winner Hilary Swank returns home to help the family decide what to do next I felt\nThe most vulnerable than I ever had as an actor and the role because it was\nPlaying someone that I felt with those similar to me\nIs that a woman finding our way and ... for so long and women are just by nature nurture it and we take care of people that's what we do and that's what we're taught to do\nSo at what point do you say this isn't right for me and I need to take care of myself first and stop pleasing other people in order to live my most authentic life did\nYou also brings some personal experience to all of this\nMy dad got a lung transplant and I was his whole caretaker I took time off and I was helping my dad for three years and I think it definitely helps you understand what a crisis like this is and it it helps you remind you to be living in the moment\nMichael Shannon plays Ruth son Nick\nAbove the cycle of giving and taking care of the evidence and families or you know you're born and and you need to be taken care of and then as you grow up you learn how to take care of yourself and then you were to\nDo you find yourself in a position where would you need to be taken care of again\nShe had on me oh not an\nIssue for him and she was looking in which she\nElizabeth she's such a smart writer and with you have to have I think ... or you you can bust right and just like\nWell yeah they just if you just come at it from like a straight up boys and just said isn't to solve all four of you and then you wind up with like a hallmark movies a\nWeek was that all what is there with that is he's my boy see my grandmother didn't want to be called like she wanted to be treated like she always was and you know and we were a family of ... and\nWhen you do your heart is closest to breaking is when you're laughing loudest at least that's how it is with the people that I Love", "show_name": "PBS NewsHour", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "27"}
