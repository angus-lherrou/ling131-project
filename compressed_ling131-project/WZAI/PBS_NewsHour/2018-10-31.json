from I ...\nBecause even though it was a happy occasion\nI knew that like in that chapel where I\nHad my bar mitzvah that\nThat's maybe where people specter Plano moments\nThat's why I'm your state because their lives or not in danger and this was a time for people to put aside their differences find common ground and to heal as a community\nAgainst that backdrop agree came President Trump's trip\nLike many unicorn that he did not\nHis ongoing rhetoric and just the nastiness and name calling and putting something down it's just like playground politics if you will and there needs to be decency and uh humanity and bringing people together and he is not demonstrated that\nAre in word or an action\nWhat President Trump said he wanted to pay his respects\nI'm also going to the hospital to see the officers and uh some of the people that were so badly hurt so and I really look forward to going\nThe president landed in Pittsburgh late this afternoon but a number of other officials declined to join him democratic ... you know I requested Mr Trump wait until all the funerals were over fellow Democrat in county executive rich Fitzgerald agreed\nI think in light of how this was all but for them and some of the rhetoric that has of her [noise] um [noise]\nI don't know that it would be a unifying visit [noise]\nUm I think if we might even be added to the device of this of what's going on and that probably isn't the again the timing of people were still grieving very\nRaw emotions governor Tom Wolfe was also a Democrat skip the presidential visit as well\nAs it house minority leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer\nLeaders of Mr Trump's own party Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell sided scheduling conflicts and did not attend stashed Cutler is head of a progressive Jewish organization than the art the group wrote an open letter signed by the thousands or even the president not to visit\nIf this president for fear and wanting to respect\nOf this tragedy wanting to me for nearly respectful\nOf the Jews who have been slaughtered he will go back and he will keep all this time\nAnd he will actually consider his behavior and his actions and what to do to change to actually create a country where people are living in unity and our living our clothes and food\nOthers that the president was welcome Eliot thinking is the son of a former director at tree of life\nJust by the time to be political and it's a time to stand back and respect the office of the president I've staged do we have to agree with everything he or she has ever said of course not an angry at him and telling him is not the right time he should wait for a guaranteed to wait another week people would say why did he waits along\nRabbi Jeffrey Maier from the tree of life congregation also told CNN quote\nUm I Am a citizen he is my president he is certainly welcome the president himself kept a low profile during today's visit it did not speak publicly\nMeanwhile the packages for vigils and religious services in cities across the country last night\nAnd Jewish and non Jewish congregations alike\nPresident Trump and first lady millennia Trump met with leaders inside that synagogue for about twenty minutes they ... they did not enter the crime scene area Judy\n... you talked in your report about how divided the Pittsburgh community has been about the president's visit and you said just behind you a few minutes ago there were protests\nYes just behind me a few minutes ago hundreds of people gathered to protest President Trump\nComing to Pittsburgh they say that the president hasn't displayed the empathy that other presidents this late in the path so they don't want him here um there are people of course a walk from the president but the protestors in particular for the President Trump's rhetoric contributed to what they see as a culture of violence in the country I shouldn't say that the protesters did chat and cheer for first responders as they walked by\nWell speaking of that the president we know also met with law enforcement uh while he was there and what do we know about the response that he received\nWell I spoke to several people including the the president of the police union here that person told me that he welcomes the president coming he said that the president has been very pro law enforcement during his entire presidency\nAnd that he's coming here because he feels as though he's concerned for the law enforcement here so the the police really welcome the president here I should say that the ... there was a large police presence as the president was around here and it's not surprising that\nThat police officers would be happy to see President Trump\nCome to Pittsburgh given all of that President had said for police officers\nYou Michelle send or White House correspondent uh with the president today in Pittsburgh thanking image thanks you\nWill take a closer look at the rise of anti Semitism and hate crimes in this country later in the program in the days other news rescue teams searched again for victims of an Indonesian airliner that crashed in the job of see the lion air passenger jet went down one day just after take off from Jakarta\nKilling all one hundred and eighty nine people on board cruise pull more debris and dozens of human remains from the water today while relatives waited for confirmation of the worst\nAnd President Trump was asked to have any method for your followers\nAnd would have been a perfect moment to say you may disagree with the with what the reporter wrote but there's no room in our campaign for anti Semitism for a tax for racism for white supremacy he said I have nothing to say than\nWe've seen that kind of thing over and over it's what I call wink wink nod nod dog with so uh\nThe getting whether he intends that to be the messenger not that's the message that is being sent that message that's being receive and without that kind of message or they wouldn't have been those events I Believe that when there's less likely that it would have been those events that we saw on Saturday and square all hell\nJonathan ... would you agree with that that the rhetoric directly contributes because if the president and his supporters and anyone who is doing what what Deborah first who has these dog whistle calls you know they all went silent the hatred and bigotry that that is anti Semitism which still exist wouldn't it\nWell of course anti Semitism is often called the oldest hatred it's been a persistent problem for centuries some would argue even millennia\nBut the issue is this and we know this from the words of the white supremacist themselves to David Dukes the Richard Spencer's the Andrew Anglin's these individuals' with their poisonous prejudice they have celebrated on line when they've seen terms like America First\nOr global list or more recently nationalist\nAnd up literally in the talking points of candidates and the officials themselves and I I Do want to say something and this was important this is not political after Charlottesville we saw leaders from the Republican Party and the Democratic party called this out\nHowever this demands not just saying something in response to an incident but rather it's the climate leaders create every single day\nAnd we need people in positions of authority across the board keep in mind\nThat fifty seven percent increase included in Ninety percent increase of acts of anti Semitism on college campuses so whether you're the president of a university or the president of the United states people in positions of authority need to shut this down as soon as they hear it\n[noise] I'm Deborah Lipstadt Jonathan mentioned earlier the role that social media plays and we certainly saw that this particular suspect in Pittsburgh was very active on social media site called gap that was a seemingly a haven of anti Semite and racists\nWhat role do you think social media plays does it just amplify existing prejudices or is it something more\nI think it amplifies a Fifteen prejudices and it also connects people and I write about it and I've written about and been sued by Holocaust deniers it used to be when you wanted to spend denial material dissenting brown paper on bailouts\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nSo it's both an amplification and a connection and I think that is is exceptionally dangerous\nSo drawn to the ... what do we do with regards to curtailing that kind of online hatred because as we've seen if Facebook or Twitter crack down on that they simply congregate somewhere else so I mean wonder what is worse is it better if they're hidden in the corners on Web sites that we don't really know about or or is it better for seven in the open and we can be aware of it\nWill look at the idea where fierce advocate for the first amendment and I think freedom of speech is an important precious privilege guaranteed to our constitution the freedom of speech isn't the freedom to slander people and the freedom of expression isn't the freedom to incite violence against Jews or any other minority\nThe a deal we opened a center in Silicon valley last year to work directly with the companies because we need Google Facebook Twitter Microsoft we need them engaged in this fight because in order to improve their products we need to re imagined the algorithms and they are doing\nWork they are making progress\nHowever there is more to be done and I think it's much better for all of us if the haters and the big it can exercise their free speech but in a place where our children right we're vulnerable populations isn't exposed to it\nDeborah Lipstadt in the in the last few moments that we have I Wonder if you were talking to policymakers today what would you urge them to do how how would you counsel them to stamp out this racism\nI Would urge them to speak out as as down and said I Would urge them to speak out to speak out forcefully indirectly you know I'm generally a pretty optimistic person despite spending all my time in the sewers of prejudice and hatred studying it and writing about it I think the depressing thing is this Pandora's box has been open wide\nAnd even if the president to change his rhetoric\nWhere these social media sites to begin to monitor it's a it's going to be a long time before we can even begin to slightly close that box\nOr the haters out there the racism is out there are two African Americans were were shot and killed on Thursday a week ago or just because they were black the man went to a church looking to kill blacks and he couldn't find them so we went to a supermarket we had the pythons also by ... and then we had this tragedy in Pittsburgh it's out there\nBy a lot of people to stop it one more last thing and that is a it also calls for us personally at Thanksgiving dinner\nIf you have an uncle or a young cousin will never it might be and they say something about Jews about Muslims about blacks about almost ...\nAnd you don't like it don't be silent you may not change their mind but you've gotta send young people young people at the table a message we don't agree with this and this kind of part is not acceptable\nOr Deborah Lipstadt Jonathan Greenblatt thank you both very much You're welcome thank you [noise]\n\nAs you mean south end or
