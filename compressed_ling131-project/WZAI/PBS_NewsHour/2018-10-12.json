whoa\nTrees toppled over\nForce of the storm with its one hundred fifty five miles an hour winds up or down on the coastal towns Panama City in Mexico preach along Florida's panhandle\nThings appear to be pulverized by the storm bearing the full brunt of Michael's impact as the winds finally relented and the broke an army of utility workers mobilized\nThey're fanning out to restore electricity for the nearly one million customers without power across the southeast\nFlorida governor Rick Scott we are deploying a massive wave of response and those efforts are already under way help is coming by air land and see\nSome of the hardest hit areas here in the Florida Panhandle are still too difficult to reach and as you drive around you just see miles and miles to look like this big pine trees that have come down they brought power lines with them and that's left entire community stranded\nLocal officials described widespread overwhelming damage\nWe had a lot of down trees you gotta lotta down lands and got blocked roads a power outages almost ubiquitous at this point but we're getting everybody up online as quickly as possible it's not our first rodeo we've done in the last two years so we're uh we're getting pretty darn good at it and uh and make a lot of headway by the minute\nThe storm surge crashed past trees and onto roads near ... electrical but national forest [noise]\nMany of the pine trees that the panhandle is famous for were decimated\nStaff they were to see if there's nothing to do so I'm I'm Glad I'm Still here last er I'm Glad the caller made it\nTo watch I was in

more flooding\nThe rain over six inches nail in parts of western North Carolina North Carolina was spared the vicious speeding Michael brought to Florida in parts of Georgia\nSays this storm will not go down without a fight it is still a threat and should be taken seriously particularly storm surge high winds flooding and the threat of tornadoes\nFor the PBS NewsHour in the panhandle of Florida I'm William Wrangham\nI spoke with Lee and the short time ago from Quincy, Florida where am I understand you were about Seventy miles from the coast where the storm came ashore tell us what it is like where you are\nWell Judy in a stretch that we've seen so far it is a story of tree after Trey after Trey Trey being knocked over by hurricane Michael\nI mean this stretch of the Florida Panhandle is known for its lush canopy and now the high winds of that storm of turned all those trees into into this community has nightmare power lines have been knocked down if part of why there's over a million people who have no power those high winds that came in late last night also have knocked out all the cell phone towers around here so\nCommunication is very difficult we heard on the radio today one local public a visual who was using the radio a radio interview to try to communicate with one of their own emergency managers somewhere that they couldn't find them simply because they couldn't pick up a phone that would actually work\nSo restoring power has been a huge issue here you might hear from behind me that's really the armada of utility trucks that are coming through this entire area trying to restore power but from what we saw the amount of power lines we saw down on the ground it's going to be a long time for these communities to get their power back\nSeeing those images from the coast in Mexico beach in Panama City the destruction seemed so severe\nThat surgery to the devastation along the coastline is just there really are no words to describe how bad that damages and I think that's simply a function of if you have a category ... storm it was very nearly a category five coming in a hundred and fifty five mile an hour winds\nThere's only so much you can do I mean if you remember Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in Nineteen Ninety two in building codes across the state were strengthened\nThis development the cases not over but I think it is up permanently and irreparably damaged we will seek to dismiss the indictment all of the council prosecution decision to band in my clients planes that not invalidate the truth\nAgainst Harvey Weinstein is far from over and we expect to forward with the other cases\nStill faces criminal charges involving two women nearly Seventy others have come forward to make similar accusations the case helped spark the me too movement\nSocial Security beneficiaries will see a boost in their annual cost of living adjustment or cola next year the program announced today and increase of two point eight percent to help keep pace with inflation that works out to about thirty nine dollars a month for the average retired worker\nAnd President Trump welcome rapper Kanye West and former pro football great Jim round of the White House today to discuss everything from prison reform to welfare and an Oval Office session west heap praise on the president and launched into freeform commentary\nPeople expect that if you're black you have to be Democrats I have a A R I have conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being a Democrat they say you know first of all if it is a limited amount of jobs are so the ... the father's lose their jobs\nAnd they say we'll give you more money for having more kids in your home it was something about when I put this hat off and maybe feel like Superman you made a Superman that was that's my favorite superhero and you made a supermax tape for me we're going to power our factory we can bring not only Adidas onshore recovering\nFox talked to set up a factory and I think Minnesota fifty three of them\nThey are four thousand jobs people making fifty three thousand dollars a year but when we make everything in China and not America that were cheating on our country and we're putting people in physician is how to do a legal thing ended up in a cheapest factory ever the prison\nSystem [noise] I'll tell you what that was pretty impressive [laughter]\nThat was something that was when shows sold\nFor more on this our White House correspondent and Michelle send or joins me now so you mean as you were telling me after Kanye West comments there was a strong reaction most of it negative what's behind that was\nReally a truly bizarre moment at the White House and that's mainly because it's a ... that showed that really the extreme change and kind of you with us politics\nCoyote with all the rapper known for his social activism he was a ... he was the rapper also known for calling out President Trump famously said that ... that President Bush didn't care about black people calling on President George W. Bush now an since he was talking about Katrina and the fact that they were African American who did it\nAfter the response to hurricane instead now you have kind of thing that he's not only an outspoken supporter of President Trump which of course would be in some ways normal it's the fact that he said stuff like slavery is a choice and he's also today and it's and it would be almost ten minute monologue he talked about really stereotype that have been used against African Americans\nThroughout history he said that at some point African Americans like welfare and the fact that they're not fathers in the homes of African Americans these are things that are again stereotypes are not true so a lot of people were looking at ... who is this person the rapper that we know with someone who was uplifting African American community\nSo now people are really really questioning kind of where we go from here\nWe mentioned this was a meeting the gym round while I was Kanye West they're\nKind of us was there to advocate for criminal justice reform him along with his wife can crash in West of both taken up this issue of criminal justice reform his wife ... actually directly appeal to the president and got a prisoner released through that appeal so he was talking about Larry Hoover today and he was saying that there's he's\nHe was talking about the fact that Larry Hoover who is in a really a founder co founder of the gangsters disciples which is a street gang in Chicago should be released it to someone who's facing more than a hundred years in prison because of murder so kind of was basically supposed to be talking about that but then went off on a tirade about his mental health issues and all sorts of other things\nSpeculation image the president was welcoming this in part because it's an outrage to African American voters to support him what effect do we think this could have on the president's support\nWe don't have any polling yet of course but essentially this is likely not going to help President Trump or calling us really appeal to African American Democrats or African American Republicans on the one hand African American Republicans want to have an audience with the president\nThey want to be talking about the economy about wages maybe about small business loans were after the African American communities across this country but they're not getting the audience that kind of us is getting so that's angry black Republicans and then on the black\nFor black Democrats they see somebody who's really lashing out and using stereotypes and that also isn't going to appeal the African American voters so on both instances this was really just I think a weird moment of the Trump presidency and it was really about to celebrity reality TV stars chatting it up for ten minutes but not\nReally much substance came out of this discussion\nWell it was certainly one that got everybody's attention today at an unusual and so they're released yummy she'll send or thank you thanks [noise] and\nStill to come on the news hour the state of us election security of the coming midterm Saudi Arabia comes under increased scrutiny in the disappears\nPotential solutions to the uncertain future recycling in the United states and bracelets spectacular tape on writing about other people's lives [noise]\n\nWith a twenty Eighteen mid term elections less than a month away and early voting already underway in some state officials and the Trump Administration are sounding the alarm about foreign attempts to influence the outcome of next month vote\nI spoke a short time ago with Christopher crabs he's under secretary of the department of homeland security national protection programs in directorate about these concerns and I started by asking him how he sees the threat\nGiven our experience of two thousand sixteen and what we saw the Russians attempt to do across the nations election equipment election infrastructure we certainly have a degree of concern of what their capability and they're typically is in the prior intent has demonstrated\nSo that's kind of been the planning factor that we've been working against the fact whether they come back or not we have an ... the ... the Russian right for sure right\nUh we haven't seen a demonstrated Russian activity\nIn a repeat of two thousand sixteen but I mentioned the planning aspect of our planet we're ready we're planning for them to come back and I think in terms of where we are for sixteen\nUh mentioned this before but I think this is probably going to be the most secure election in the modern era because of the amount of work we've done with state and local election officials who are by the constitution by law responsible for ministry elections federal elections\nWill as you know the president the vice president have gone out of their way and the last few days to talk about China to say that China has been trying to meddle in our elections vice president went so far as to say what the Russians have done pales in comparison to what the Chinese are doing can you explain what that means spell it out\nI think we need to keep in mind that given the way they were connected and given the way we consume and Jews and share information there is a broad range of opportunities for any nation state whether it's Russia or China\nTo try to influence the way Americans think and they act\nAnd so the Russians I think it's been historically or at least most recently much noisier much more out in front they've attempted to get into election equipment and manipulate their they've also use social media to sow discord and divisiveness the Chinese\nIt's more a under the radar perhaps a with a longer more strategic game and in play\nIn their attempts your art to influence the way the Americans think about policy issues and down the road whether it's the Eighteen but but also more for the mid term I'm Sorry the the twenty twenty presidential trying to influence how voters when they go to the polls you know what what bubble they're going to fill enter what button they're going to\nPush well it's interesting as you mentioned that because I'm a we've seen a guest newspaper inserts a one in particular in Iowa the president tweeted about that but we saw that the editor of the Des Moines register the newspaper where this\nIncident was she was quoted as saying I'm this kind of in certain meats are standard criteria for for advertising on like the kind of hidden thing that is you just mentioned the Russians\nWere doing and so is it really that underhanded I guess that's my question\nWell it's not that it's under handed it said it's in fact the foreign influence operations so we think back to two thousand sixteen\nOr and what the Russians attempted to do they use their state sponsored media outlets of spot neck in our T to amplify messaging dry false narratives China's doing the same thing with China Daily and other instruments of state media and you know they're carrying a message on behalf of\nBeijing in this case so while it may meet some journalistic standard they're still trying to accomplish an outcome and achieve their own policy objectives through these through these efforts\nIs it is it but we think the Russians as just spreading dissent [noise]\nSay well absolutely and I I think a again when you kind of lay it all out on the table of what the independent ... or the the various objectives of the nation may be the the Russians are much more tactical and operational in here and today\nOr you you find a way to do both\nOr you make it clear that there are red lines that cannot be crossed and there are consequences\nBut there's also a relationship that has to be preserved the best it can in some cases it's an uncomfortable relationship uh but you have to be able to do both you cannot take this sitting down you cannot turn another a turn a blind eye to this you have to find a way\nTo make consequences real for this kind of ... behavior\nSo I asked U.S officials say how to make those consequences real and short of stopping arms deals are some of them sited kicking diplomats out closing diplomatic posts a perhaps a changing military cooperation in Yemen imposing sanctions would any of those send a strong enough signal\nWhile I think some of them or would a as a package be a useful\nUh certainly uh backing off from our support of this costly and a devastating war in Yemen or is something that we should have been doing all along anyway I think ah we certainly have a list of Fifteen of this hit squads apparently a came to assemble\nA those people ought to be a immediately sanctioned as we have done with the Iranian and ...\nThe past I think other economic sanctions might follow uh I I don't think we need to uh she spent all relations or pull our diplomats are we need to continue diplomacy and this was a time for diplomacy but it's also a time to impose consequences\nAssume out a little bit and talk about the man or at the center of this at least in Saudi Arabia and haven't been so I'm On\nThe crown prince widely notice NBS he has his critics and you specifically mentioned the Yemen War there have been a lot of civilian casualties a lot of criticism of Saudi Arabia and how it is conducted that war this incident or as well he's been really center at that criticism\nDo you believe that this criticism of him could reduce his chances of becoming king\nI think there's a chance of that at last Baron mindset about a year ago he incarcerated a number of the senior royals and the rich Carlton along with a number of rash of Saturday oligarchy ... and so I think uh there is an entire Qadri of the family are set is viewing him with great skepticism if not outright resentment\nOr he owns many of the policies that have been pursued over the last two years and most of them had been colossal failures the war in Yemen or the abduction of the Lebanese prime minister or the boycott of cutter\nUh and so you can go down the list and you don't really see many successes the failure of the aramco I'd be oh\nUh the failure of their solar projects so uh I think at some point there at the responsible people in Saudi Arabia are going to be asking questions they're going to be asking ... whether he really does stand behind this crown prince at a time when he appears to be a ... reckless\nAnd quickly in the time we have left a huge new demo her show he ah he works for the Saudi Government he was not in any way a dissident least he didn't identify himself as fat she criticized the methods that Mohammed and saw him on is using what does it say that heat of all people he\nCould have been targeted\nI think it's a really outlandish or he was a they drew a Saturday patriot who had some differing views it was also complimentary occasionally of the reform agenda of the cramped branch so ah he called it as you saw it which is the same ... show gay I knew Fifteen to Eighteen years ago\nA back in those days she was fired a couple of times from Saudi newspapers and then re hired by prince Turki the Saudi ambassador to the u._k.\nActually had a surreal admires within the Saudi royal family I suspect\nThat continues and they are devastated by what is happening Robert Jordan former U.S ambassador to Saudi Arabia thank you very much like you [noise]\nNow to our series of reports on the plastic problem last week economics correspondent Paul some I looked at the recycling crunch the United states now faces as China has stopped accepting much of our waste\nThis week he tries to answer the question so what do we do now the story is part of our weekly series making sense which runs every Thursday move\nPut these in a recycling chips bags go ... you can't we got to put it in the regular recycling but they're all connected station they recycle all kinds of things\nYou might think if only each of us did is Cambridge, Massachusetts recycling fanatic nearest thing does\nOften times when I go to have there which is what I call recycling Santo\nYou ... what I call it haven't haven't everyone should go there\nTo mirror seeing having to most Americans not even on the radar gun you recycle\n\nShe can't be serious this is heaven yeah to some of her residence is is heaven\nMichael Moore runs recycling for Cambridge where more than a few highly motivated recycler is like sing reside class your book exchange classy somewhat bigger ticket items\nSuch as the chair and sitting on right now this is something that a resident dropped off in that I no longer need and later today someone will be taken this chair home\nWith China and other countries suddenly rejecting recyclables and trash prices rising as landfills closed down one response might be to emulate Cambridge is recycling kind of wild discipline the rest of this bubble wrap\nIt would be nice to know exactly what to put an event this shouldn't go in resign\nBubble wrap and plastic bags plastic film in general should not be going in the recycling\nBecause you have the machinery the number one salmon is in the number one most damaging contaminated and there were psychic facility\nWere cyclists a paper plates or a tricky one where we're looking for clean paper products often paper plates have food product on it or maybe it's ...\nAs long as there's no food in it is okay and they can ... the Greece's okay yeah we can recycle pizza box you're making me feel better [noise]\nBut so much that's put into the bin is not OK so Cambridge tries to teach people\nWith a little tough love our driver will go for the rejection sticker on it notes to them what they did wrong move and they'll have to call it and clean it up and then we'll come back and pick it up the next day but every once in a while we have to kind of nice people in the right direction and I'd say that's more like a show that in\nThe city also has an instructional sorting game in their Cambridge recycles and videos posted on their website including one for kids\nIn the hospital\nAs does the state of Massachusetts with nearly two hundred and fifty communities taking part in an effort to educate consumers\n[noise] but the problem with single stream when he signed for you don't sort out plastic pay for\nNeed lots of work at the plant there is however a major garbage can be isolated resigned\nFood waste which makes up a quarter of all trench most of it ends up running in landfills we're generates missing a greenhouse gas way more potent than carbon dioxide\nSo why not compost organic matter but Mike or his predecessor Randy mail back in two thousand and two\nMakes it possible for people not for really have to get anything I just dropped ... fourteen\nAnd sixteen years after she had the idea Cambridge is turning food waste into clean energy with pick up city wide and a new plant in nearby Charles down\nSome of this I Believe came from a grocery store perhaps it's expired product Eric Myers runs the food waste operation\nAnd that material they want to recycle it but it's not suitable for human consumption\nBut it's been a lot easier to just dump outdated orange juice and yesterday was dead heads of lettuce and bummer hummus\nEven no good Neko way for his name for the reason is shuttered New England can't come just a few miles away [noise]\nInstead they're all now turned into what's called an engineered bio slurry\nLending process to make what we like to think of as kind of an energy super shake that has an incredible amount of energy and you just think of it as food waste but it's really fats and sugars record carbohydrates and proteins\nSo every day some ten thousand gallons of super she is piped in\nWhere it's transformed and just you\nThe same way waste water recovery facility street dirty water\nRight now with this plan the energy is being used to power the wastewater plant itself but in the future\nEvery ton we receive here we can generate enough power to power about Ninety nine holes\nMeaning that when this plan fits is handling capacity of two hundred and fifty cents a day it can power twenty four hundred\nHopes the U.S generate something like a hundred thousand tons of food waste a day but barely five percent of it is being recycled use it all and we'd be able to power more than a million homes a day and that's not all\nIn addition to extracting energy from the food waste they also take the solids that are left over they put him through another testing process and they create a product that in this case is a product to just like little gray", "show_name": "PBS NewsHour", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "12"}
