B. piece of property if it isn't got something wrong with that it's leveled things that were on the beach are now on the other side of history [noise]\nSome people here but they could ride out the storm but then he wins at a hundred and fifty five miles per hour driving an enormous wall of water races now\nI noticed that things seem to be moving outside and I thought that trees for going by and I realized it was our house broken off the foundation and was floating around as war both of our vehicle\nHere in Panama City which is about twenty miles from Mexico beach a lot of residents here also chose not to evacuate earlier this week the governor and issued a mandatory evacuation order for this region when you have to remember that back then Michael was only a category one storm\nCorey Clifton trench was in his house when Michael hit his grandmother and ten year old sister evacuated but he and his dad state barricaded my father for the chairman at the helm without really\nI was praying that it would hurry up 'cause we didn't have too much longer we had the bathroom at that in the marvel flew all part of it you were hunkered down in the bathroom the whole time\n[noise]\nThe back of their house was torn off as was the roof they've lost everything you guys have any insurance on them and\nWe are good at it because of the roof to discuss that shaped before [noise] so what are you guys going to do\nThis neighbor teary Stewart was in his home next door when Michael heads of state to a few of them but this one\nYou decided to say we're just\nGoing to get rain all for this and then they face category three or less our stadium and then the last minute I'm just like well I'm staying now\nIt'll be my last one I promise you meaning next time one time Iran here yeah because I mean we didn't expect it to be like that and it just changes that we play on you\nIn these communities now there is no power or running water and very limited communications\nThere's no infrastructure there to support you um and quite honestly it's a dangerous area to go back into the mode ministry their Brock\nLong said Cruz or movies food water and other supplies the area but he had some strong words for those who chose not to evacuate\nIt's frustrating to us because we repeat the cycle over and over again\nLong said he expected the death toll decline as Cruz finally begin reaching the hardest to communities\nIs not the wind blowing them apart at the ocean and crashing waves going in and very few people live to tell what it's like to experience storm surge and unfortunately in this country we seem to not learn the lesson [noise]\nAfter hitting the Florida Panhandle the remnants of Michael cause deadly flash flooding across North Carolina and Virginia overnight before heading out in the Atlantic ocean today\nToday our state begins recovering from yet another storm\nNorth Carolina governor Roy Cooper said rescue crews working around the clock this coming just a month after Hurricane Florence struck the eastern part of his day during Michael\nWe saw rain totaling\nAlmost ten inches in Allegheny county and most things in between this morning\nNearly half a million North Carolina homes and businesses are without power [noise]\nBacking Panama City people are starting to put their lives back together they're glad to be safe and to a person everyone told us that this is the last hurricane they'll try to ride out\nAnd William joins me now so William you are now in Panama City that's close to where the hurricane came ashore tell us what you're saying there\nThe of the scale of destruction here is just incredibly vast out on the coast which is about a mile in that direction we saw what the storm surge did to those communities\nThat wall of water just ripped buildings right off their foundations further inland which is where we are right now the destruction is much more vast it's a much bigger area and it's largely the wind that brought down these trees everywhere we go\nAs would be released by five hundred thousand Hiroshima class atomic bombs exploding every day it's a big planet but that's an enormous amount of energy and more than Ninety percent of that extra heat energy going into the oceans and that's\nA distorting and disrupting the water cycle by ... much more moisture into these storms and even without hurricanes we get the so called rain bombs that that just a devastate the places where it falls north\nIs another example uh and as the scientists have pointed out this was not true for hurricane Michael this week\nBut Hurricane Florence in Hurricane Harvey just stayed in place for days and days and days that something new to and it's because we're beginning to see the disruption of wind currents along with ocean permanent so\nThe the northern hemisphere jetstream or that that normally moves the storms are out to the east is getting loop here and wave here and sometimes disorganized so uh this is really serious stuff we have a global emergency\nAnd you you use the phrase like that and some people\nAre immediately say OK calm down you know that can't be that bad but it is and what the scientists have warned us in this recent a report is that if we do not take action quickly\nTo switch away from a dirty fossil fuels and\nShift to electric vehicles and make agriculture in forestry much more sustainable and deal with the waste loops in manufacturing all things that we can do we know how to do them we ought to be doing these things for other reasons anyway but if we do not began taking action very quickly\nAnd creating jobs in the process by the way then the scientists warn us that the consequences down the road would be far far worse than what we're experiencing now and could actually extend to an existential threat\nTo human civilization on this planet as we know it\nWell let me I didn't want to ask about the political response as you know a number of conservatives other scientists are saying hey these dire a pinch of protections are just not borne out by evidence but the thing is the political or\n... well hold hold on let me stop you there when you say other scientists\nNot really a there there are a few\nThere are a few outliers but you know Ninety nine plus percent of the scientific community is aligned on these objective you still have some people who say the earth is flat and not around but you don't give them equal time and saying some people say round some people say flat\nAnd the night or to interrupt you know they are a minority but they are cited by a by political conservatives but the question I Want to ask as one of the recommendations for example for his ... thank you need to raise taxes raised\nGroups that in that emit carbon his that though politically realistic or in the in the world we live in here in the United states right now\nI'm it it is tough politically of course that's what China's beginning to do that is what the European Union is now doing a ... and whether it's direct as a carbon fee or tax or indirect or in the form of a\n... a trading system which some people don't walk but actually it can be made to work one way or another\nWe should put a price\nOn the pollution that is opposing such a deadly threat to the future of our civilization yes\nWell hey when it comes to political reaction to the president President Trump and people in his administration don't seem to be taking this new un report very seriously the president said something like I can give you reports that are fabulous I can give you some that aren't so good he and the people around him are saying\nWe're mostly focused on the economy are and what we're doing is rolling back those regulations environmental regulations that have hurt our economy and slowed down business in this country\nAt well or his proposal is literally insane and his reaction to the scientific community's warning so it is a\nAn outlier reaction uh it's making a the U.S come off like a road message and and being different from any other\nNation in the entire world and of course everybody knows it's because of the large\nCarbon polluters or ... or a A R his buddies and he wants to to use them as a as a way of signaling a two ultra conservatives that he doesn't care about what the truth of the matter is\nPresident Trump is out right now on the campaign trail almost every day trying to stir up his base voters or he's saying the Democrats are like an angry mob coming off the Kavanaugh nomination to the Supreme Court has clearly trying to stir up his base\nBut my question to you is is that an effective tactic on his part\nWell we'll find out this November ah I I don't know Judy I'm not a great political analyst but my personal impression is that there are a tens of millions of Americans some of\nIt's on Trump the last time around changing things up trying something new but I think there are tens of millions who\nGave him a chance and are now a little bit hard sick that he has been acting out to every day a telling false it's almost as easily as the breeze and I know some people will hear me say that it's like oh that's just the Democratic reaction I I guess that we have a\nMore tribalism to use the buzz word that's common these days\nThan it is healthy for our nation but common sense and a a respect for for a reason discourse has always played a balancing role in American politics I have a feeling that it's going to play a role in this election I think that if ever there was a time\nFor the re institution of the checks and balances that our founders put into our constitution now is that time and I think a lot of Republicans and independents as well as Democrats are kinda quietly\nItching for the opportunity to go to the polls and send a message to President Trump to calm down don't be so crazy don't be so\nHarmful to our country what should the Democratic party's message be this year and then going into twenty twenty where the president who has made his own personality such a big issue [noise]\nHe's a he's a talented entertainer at a rally reality uh TV uh a star a but he ... his term as president is not really going well and in my opinion\nAre the economic recovery which began under the last administration has continued unabated I'm even with the stock market to roller coaster or this week\nUh I expected hope it will continue but the damage he is doing to the good name of the United states of America is Justin calculus ... I think people uh do not want this kind of\nOf anger and repeated false or ... or in our political discourse and\nYou asked me what the Democrats should do well I I guess the tide strategy would just be to say look\nOr give us a chance to counter rain him mental\nEvent so many of these excesses so that he doesn't have free rein to\nTo put the polluters in charge of environmental policy to take away protections the American people need and all these other areas of our lives and I I kinda think the American people are going to want to do that in November\nFormer vice president Al Gore joining us from Los Angeles thank you very much thank you [noise]\nAs we've reported there are two major stories coming out of turkey today next shift and reports on how both revealed tensions between the U.S and critical allies\nToday fifty year old pastor Andrew Brunson was released from Turkish custody and the U.S turkey relationship was released from its most serious point of contention\nBrunson let the courthouse in a convoy after being convicted on terrorism charges and was set free on time served\nYou spent two years in custody and recently became a media sensation as he went between court in house arrest\nThe charges against him locked all of the progress on us Turkish relations and became the main irritant between Turkish president wretch of tired of everyone in the U.S released pastor Andrew Brunson now or be prepared to face the consequences\nFrom July to yesterday vice president Mike Pence and the administration maintain pressure on turkey with sanctions in public statements we will continue to stand strong a until\nAnd ah and and I think that's the that's the message it's going to be a referendum as it is every mid term on the president\nAnd his numbers right now are just about the same point where black Obama's weren't twenty ten when the Democrats suffered no one's defeat Bill Clinton's in Ninety four when the Democrats suffered a big defeat in two thousand and six George Bush is when the Republicans lost control of the car\nBut you do have the president David out talking about Democrats are part of an angry mob a calling them evil I mean using that some of the strongest language has used is that likely to to get his base even more fired up\nYour [laughter] yeah I think it's working you know ah we were in an age of negative polarization and it would mean you don't have to like your own party to update the other one uh and that means it's all about contempt\nA and has the other side made you appalled have they made you feel contemptuous and one thing the Capitol hearing has done has made both sides feel there's a poll and\nAnd so that has fired up both bases and the effect is a and it's always worth reminding ourselves that we no longer having won election anymore we have a red state election in a blue state election\nUh and so the odds are looking pretty good at the polls have been shifting a Republican way on the Senate side and all those red states Texas Montana and those places on the Senate is looking more secure as of this moment\nThe house is looking more in danger for the Republicans at this moment as Reverend women move over to the Democratic side so we have two different elections and there seems to pretty strong momentum in opposite directions\nHoward Democrats countering this I mean this approach by the president marketing there there is is that a couple of polls including the one we did with nearest NPR this week it came out and show yes the enthusiasm gap\nAh has narrowed it was the Democrats who were more energized and indeed Republicans seemed to be more energized what ... how the Democrats come back\nWell the first thing to do is is is stopped picketing 'em and stopped but boycotting uh and and organize I made the most democratic group in the entire electorate of voting age Eighteen and thirty five\nAnd they live everywhere they aren't concentrated in certain districts like\nA ... to African Americans Latino sit by our uh they're they're everywhere and that if they vote the Democrats win big I will say this I think the most encouraging signs that the Democrats as the Democrats do have a a a a national macro message in this campaign it's about\nChecks and balances on President it's not a new message but it's it's a message that certainly resonates with what voters are about preserving the strength of healthcare a particular the uh uh the the pre existing condition a provision\nBut most of all I think it's contrasted Republicans who don't have a national message they really don't they're running Mike Rowe campaigns one get one district it's a you double park and you've got several parking tickets you and later on your library books or\nYou missed your mother's birthday I mean they're running very personal campaigns in the very micro sense I think that's good so I don't think I'd say is\nLook at the governor's races the governor's races across the country if you really want to see which way the country's going they're going blue they're not they're not going red when you've got Democrats can competitive in places like Oklahoma and Kansas I'm In South Dakota which they are right that as we speak here tonight\nUh then you know there's a possibility that the Democrats sweeping that entire belt from the mid west all the way to the east coast\nWe did hear David Al Gore a sank talking about checks and balances that that's a that's a good motivating thing for Democrats on it but but what about that I mean is\nA ... a United in some way and sound and a message that there\nYou're not unity is not any parties problem right now they're both they're all pretty unified uh to me or one of the ... an interesting debate is happening if you could call it the Michelle Obama Hillary Clinton to base\nA and when Michele Obama famously said when they go low will go high she's sticking to that\nAre ... and Hillary Clinton says no they're going low we got to go to and you see that debate I think in this age or having the moral high ground is a bit of an advantage a major advantage and because of Donald Trump's behavior or he is put the Republicans at a moral disadvantage\nAnd keeping go staying Hi sting reasonably civil not totally going into the gutter with Donald Trump strikes me is the right democratic strategy in the right strategy for any movement because once you go down there you self corrupt\nAnd so I mean one begin see Eric Holder said if they go after us we kick them you know that you're beginning to see a lot of people getting so angry about having on other things or any means necessary to me that that is a mistake just for the soul of your party\nThey let me say I agree with David I think it's a\nIt's I Know the the right thing to do um but uh the wise thing to do and it gets to the best interest of the country\nAnd as a practical level you can't compete with Donald Trump he's just better at it than anybody else that are asked he better better at finding identifying the weakness a shortcoming of his opponent and then explaining it\nUm it is it is a is a major talent he did it the Syrian leader each of the Republican challenges in twenty sixteen he did it to ... to Secretary Clinton and the election um and and that's really what what makes this midterm election he he he's searching for an opponent that he can do the same\nIn the politics he specializes in is I don't really like those kinds of people\nLike we used to have debates that health care about you know economic policy about foreign policy now it's just those people are really bad those people who say you're a bad actually they're the bad ones and and that's a style of politics somehow we've gotten away from issues and the governor's races or maybe that's a third electric cars the governor's races tend to be a little more about issues and they are seen as a Democrat\nAnd and one one governor's race I don't know if it's swinging to the Democrat but it is in Georgia a mark where you have a Stacey Abrams African American woman running for governor she is now working pointing out her her Republican opponent has the state attorney general ... I'm Sorry at ...\nNot that he is by virtue of an action he's taken him in the last few weeks suppressing the votes she says uh fifty three thousand a potential voters what I think most of the more than two thirds of them happened to be African American and she's trying to make an issue of this saying he should step down as a state as a secretary of state is that something that\nYou know in a place like Georgia is likely to be effective\nUh certainly Stacey Abrams campaign is is interested in registering a turning out African American voters the idea of any minority group especially when there's been marginalized minority group electing one of its own to the governorship\nIs is a motivating factor to vote on the fact that Brian Kemp secretary's day has not recused himself\nAnd that his office is it seems so overtly engaged in a in a suppression Seventy percent of the fifty three thousand people\nWho now as I as I was just registration has closed had been told that they couldn't vote um does it does seem a up beyond ... bad play a bad form it really seems like just a bad ethics\nAs secretary of state David he oversees elections so [laughter] you know start running for governor\nI don't know how clear the ... the Republicans are claiming that if you come to the polls that id you'll be able to vote so it's unclear to me how severe as it is but it's a no brainer\nThat if you're running for an election you shouldn't be super ... election like you're the you're the hitter and the umpire that doesn't work and so he should have recused himself long ago and it and to me it's just a no brainer that's obviously what you do in any normal circumstance\n[noise] few minutes we have left I Want to ask you about the ... what's been going on this week with a Saudi Arabian us mark\nThe Saudi journalist who disappeared is believed to have been murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey in Istanbul, Turkey the the Trump President Trump and the people around him seemed to be holding back in their criticism of Saudi Arabia the president said it it's not good it doesn't look good but\nWe're what shouldn't administration that has had a I tried to be close to Saudi Arabia basing right now about what appears to be this unspeakable thing that happened well\nI mean ... ... American administration would be expected to have a moral bearing Republican or Democrat um and the moral foundation um the administration this president has never made any pretense to it I mean he lives by the golden rule that his he has the gold rules um\nHe is reduced is I mean the charge is so serious that are recruited by the Soviet by the Saudis themselves by the powers to be a Fifteen people went in and took\nHer show and then dismembered him I went in with a saw that got cut up bones I mean it it is that that that beyond human decency and imagine so it's unimaginable so I mean to me that that is that's what's missing here is any sense of morality most of all just thirty second sorry\nYeah I mean usually when you sold your soul for money you try to hide the fact whether it's our official policy now\nThat if you're rich and you buy a lot of stuff for most of them you can do all sorts of monstrous things and it is a commercial mentality a that is not what we said for all our lives are not what we would expect in any human being a state of ... and you said we have different ... and some are higher than others that are low for basically since we should be higher than our love for money", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PBS NewsHour", "city": "Brewster", "day": "13"}
