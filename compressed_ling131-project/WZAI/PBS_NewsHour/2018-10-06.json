past few hours after a day of high drama in the United States Senate congressional correspondent Lisa does your death begins our coverage\nA dramatic scene with senators in their seats voting one by one on whether to move forward with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ms ... for Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski it was a quiet no the lone Republican no votes said she made up her mind as she walked onto the Senate floor\nTradition that none of it and I\nBelieve he is a good man it just may be that in mind [noise]\nMurkowski was one of four key questionable votes when the day started Republicans needed two of those four to vote yes on the procedural motion they got three Republican Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Democrat Joe Manchin\nThat got cabin up past the key procedural hurdle the A's or fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed to but it wasn't clear if Collins would vote yes on his confirmation itself\nUntil she took to the floor in the afternoon Mr precedents no senator has been under more pressure from both sides calling spoke to many issues including whether Kavanaugh would overturn roe versus Wade decision legalizing abortion\nProtecting this race is important to me\nTo my knowledge judge Kavanaugh is the first Supreme Court nominee\nTo express a view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition but rooted in article three of our constitution is sell\nOn the allegations of sexual assault\nThe facts presented Judy not me that President that professor Ford was not sexually assaulted that night or as some other time\nBut they do

him to\nAlong with a reopened FBI investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct Democrats like Dick Durbin of Illinois who voted no today pointed to Kavanaugh's temperament at the hearing it's hard\nTo imagine how a nominee who is displayed such Raul partisanship ... claimed to sure served as a neutral umpire and Supreme Court judge Kavanaugh through his testimony who's ... stowed\nIn a rare move Kavanaugh himself addressed his emotional testimony in an op ed for the wall Street Journal last night writing\nMy hearing testimony was forceful and passionate I might have been too emotional at times I Know that my tone was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the nominee on Fox News\nI thought his tone in last week's hearing a was exactly what you would expect from somebody and going through a what Brett Kavanaugh and his family have been through over the last ah several weeks\nYou will have to tell your children rattling where are you today\nAround the Capitol anti Kavanaugh protestors gathered again those concerns were dismissed by Republicans inside the chamber John Cornyn of Texas applauded the vote\nOr vote today was important not only because will allow us to move forward and include this confirmation process but it was important because it showed that the United States Senate will not be intimidated we will not be bullied or the ... paid protesters and name calling by the mob\nDemocrats California's ... Harris still question has thrown as of the latest FBI investigation\nThis was not a search for the truth this was not an investigation this was an abdication of responsibility and duty\nIf confirmed tomorrow Kavanaugh could join the other eight justices on the Supreme Court early next week\nAnd Lisa joins me now along with news our White House correspondent yummy ... I'll send or\nHello to both of you Lisa as we said what a dramatic day tell us a little bit more about what it was like when did the yes both decide what factors went into the decision a dramatic after such a dramatic week Judy going into this vote I spoke to several Republican leaders including ...\nWho is a good vote count or they did not know if they had the votes going in the last time that happened on health care they lost it was a big gamble but in the end as you sat in that chamber I saw Lisa Murkowski with her head down looking at our hands I saw Susan Collins next to her the two\nAnd when he did that when you often\nI shot a\nDefense attorney Daniel Herbert of former Chicago cop called than dykes conviction a sad day for law enforcement if\nPolice officers that they can never fire is somebody that is acting the way the wind McDonald's is when they're twelve feet away from a I think that what we're going to have the resources are going to become security guards\nProsecutor Joseph McMahon praised the outcome\nGratifying verdict\nSuccessful in pursuit for justice\nMen died could face decades behind bars when he was sentenced\nFor more on today's verdict in the reaction to it we're joined by brand has Friedman she followed the trial for Chicago Tonight on PBS station W W brand is thanks so much for joining us\nWhat's the reaction that we've seen in the in the tape you saw the scene outside the courthouse I've seen pictures of marchers going through downtown Chicago what's the reaction been\nSo we've heard from a lot of different community members many of them say that they think this is at least some sort of justice for the Kwan McDonald is is a step towards justice so I think you know what we're seeing the strength a lot of us are calling them protests I think these are actually more like demonstrations I don't think any of them are actually\nProtesting the the ... the verdict itself there actually are celebrating kind of marching in solidarity in remembrance of look one with Donald\nVan Dyke was originally charged with first degree murder of a jury convicted him on second degree murder as I understand that suggested they\nBelieved he didn't believe that has a wife was an endangered but the belief was unreasonable I Know you've heard some of the jurors talk about their verdict what they said their decision turned on\nWell they say a number of things so uh one of them was the option to convict on second degree murder instead of first degree murder the jurors say they felt that Jason Van Dyke\nActually felt that he was in danger that he and the officers around him face an imminent risk and that that is what he acted on it that's why they didn't convict on first degree murder second degree instead they also say it was the end I own testimony they didn't think that he was very credible they say that he had a hard time recalling what happened the night of the incidents\nAre and that what he said a lot of it and didn't match what they saw in the video specifically when Van Dyke you just heard testified that he saw the corn McDonald from his perspective raise that knife in his direction they see the video does not bear that out and then there is the video they say they watched it obviously many times in the courtroom\nBut they also watch that a lot in their own deliberations and that had a good deal to do with it they also felt that a Van Dyke being an officer of almost Twenty years that he should have been able to de escalate the situation rather than opening fire\nAnd so much was made in ... and leading up to the ah the trial about the makeup of the jury what was the racial makeup of the jury\nSo the jury a lot of people say that it was not very diverse or I Can't recall exactly the breakdown men and women as well as racial diversity but this case was me out to be a lot about race and\nA African American a juror and we did hear from her this afternoon as well but when we heard from those jurors one of them said you know race came up very little in their deliberations for them this was not about race in fact one of them said we were here for justice\nA lot has happened or just I've got a big effect on the city of Chicago police commissioner lost his job on the streets which are the prosecuting attorney for the county was uh was voted out if there's some sense that this is a turning point\nI think a lot of people hope that this is a turning point in like you said a lot has happened since then a lot of the protesters and since the video has come out a lot of them have also been asking for Mayor Rahm Emanuel's job and he several weeks ago announced that he's not running\nAnd that former police superintendent who lost his job at the time he is one of the very many people who is running to replace him so that will be another change\nBut the police accountability task force that was appointed shortly after the video was released\nIt was one of many in a succession um and so some people I think are also a maybe a bit jaded and thinking uh that uh\nThat this is going to be a turning point that turning point could have been when the video was released because as you said a lot has happened since then uh the city has finally come to an agreement on a consent decree with the state's attorney general uh so I think there is some hope but obviously the city's\nHistory of distrust between the community and the police department it's generations old and so it's probably going to take a lot more than a this verdict to to\nImplement a lot of heavy

developed with each victim when he addressed the European Parliament in France back in twenty four teams shuts\nIn upholding the Affordable CARE Act\nOr that this had been a political decision politically made arrived that people know what they're doing a and he refused to to overturn so we're now Judy what we what we have we had was at his campaign and David Wright was bitter and ugly campaign But Kevin I became the Kennedy\nUm and ah there were many and spent on his behalf on television million spent against them a that was mobilization or to make his case he went on for an on Fox television or to present himself as a family man a loving father a devoted husband assault citizen\nI'm In a ... a week later under siege he chose the ... boxes on Wall Street Journal editorial page or to make his case of an apology for perhaps is overreaction I say this only because\nI'm a contrast in Nineteen sixty when John Kennedy under siege for his religion went to the Houston ministers a rather unfriendly venue this in this case he chose to again and our political to go to your do your own silos and I just think that's where we are\nIt David Was there another way this could have been handled to avoid that I Know there's criticism of Senator Feinstein but once there was this accusation out there that then I leash the backlash uh the reaction from judge Kavanaugh was there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParents with their family physician I'm at at the same at the same time there there's no question David right they they went to their\nTheir camps um I I Do think that was sort of a hassle response on the part of a Republican senators said oh she's so convincing she's close compelling she's so believable something happened but she just has to be wrong about it happening with him I mean I I just found that are putting an end patronize\nI agree with that the one thing the polling a seemed to suggest that people believe her they were uncomfortable\n... more or less convicting without some corroborating evidence and so you've got sixty percent of the American people say if another witness says yes I remember that or if there's some physical evidence yes and but without that a lot of people who felt just felt uncomfortable really changing the trajectory of a man's life over this without that Graham ready\nAnd I just I just had one thing Judy and how how important the court is it's it's only Eighteen years ago that the Supreme Court resolved Bush Gore that was a case where a vice president headed states had won the popular vote\nAnd the court shows that his Republican challenger and so when I buy a five to four vote\nInactive and Norman statesmen chip\nAnd generosity of spirit Al Gore accepted it and called upon his supporters to accept it I don't know given today's climate it's David described it if a court decision would be accepted without fighting in the streets and I will say to this the support is the ... the critics of a judge Kavanaugh\nUm who are holding basically rallies in the Capitol today and tomorrow only hurting their claws they aren't helping anything um they're not they're not sure I mean there there are purposes of protest this time for protest on this and intriguing is over\nAt the end and meanwhile David near herring I you're being told that it's the backlash that is the what you mentioned and then again it's the pro Kavanaugh or that he that he has a ... of a powerful force in his behalf that's going to be out there for half of Republican\nAdvisor or last week you know over the last couple of weeks on Trump's approval rating sounded like eight points uh there's a in the red states which is where a lot of the Senate races are there's a strong tied you pay a little real political price if you're against Kavanaugh right now I Do I Can't pay the is probably going to pay is very serious ...\nShe took so that the political wind at least in the red states was hum\nIs pretty strong right now and Republican fortunes Democrats as we said last week or super engaged have always been engaged now Republicans are equally engaged and so the enthusiasm\nProbably gave me Walter a road um today Kavanaugh support trucks Trump sport if you like Trump you like having a it's it's like it's just the tribal thing uh and so it's not about the individual\nI disagree a hundred ... all one point David make I I I Do think Judy in the final analysis mid term election is a referendum on the president United States and and it will be an up or down vote on on Donald Trump\nAnd and make no mistake about it um women in this election uh are at meet women who did not go to college working women are now printing Democrat you have women white women voting democratic\nUh and that is it that said no that's a new development in this country and that's a that's a ... yes it is it's a it's a change I'm In college and before the holiday without without a college in ... I mean the group that Donald Trump carried by twenty seven points I I don't think there's any this this will be a factor\nIn the election I don't think by any means it's resolved on which side comes out\nWell the last we have probably only a little more than a minute but my last question was going to be how do we heal from this but it doesn't sound like there's a whole lot of hailing going\nYeah I think a lot of people you know the values of value vision is the first to say um and so when you see how far we've gone a lot of people who emailed me and said you know how do we learn how to persuade each other again and so you know people do that people are not stupid they they react bad things\nI I I Hope I Hope David right I Hope I'm I I don't I don't think we have a leader ah who wants to heal I mean we have three point seven percent unemployment in the country and and yet we're still talking about five minutes of in the\nUh other corners and and writing people often to stay in Philly um I think it has to it has to begin at the bottom 'cause it's not beginning at the top\nWords to remember we will remember them mark shields David Bruck thank you thank you [noise]\nAnd you can follow our coverage of the final Kavanaugh's confirmation vote that is tomorrow on Saturday will be streaming it live on our Web site that's at P.
