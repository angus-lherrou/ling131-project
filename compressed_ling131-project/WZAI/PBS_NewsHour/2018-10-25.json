agree to this will have to understand that they put their own territory under threat of a possible retaliatory strike this is obvious\nMeanwhile NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the

away\nThirty six of the fifty governorships are up for grabs this year and while Republicans currently control three fourths of them Democrats are mounting surprisingly strong challenges in some key places across the country to talk about a few of these I'm joined by bill\nCasting in Atlanta Frederica fiber of Wisconsin Public television in Madison and Tom Hudson W ELL are in public radio in Miami hello to all three of you are so glad to have you with us I'm going to start with the biggest population state Tom Hudson of course that's Florida\nAnd use the Republican incumbent Republican governor Rick Scott as giving that up to run\nFor the U.S Senate and it's turned into a pre tight race between the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee a and Republican congressman Rhonda Santa tell us what each one of these men has going in their favor on what's working against them\nWell this is not a boulevard election in Florida there is no middle of the road this is as polarizing other state election that you're going to find here in this election cycle Judy\nI think that what you have is on one side and excited progressive a Democrat or in the face of Andrew Gillum who excited base voters to come out in the primary and surprised a lot of pollsters\nAnd a lot of professional political watchers to win in a very crowded Democratic primary and on the other hand you have a a non traditional Republican candidate in the form of Congressman Ron dissent is\nWho has run on the playbook of twenty sixteen Donald Trump and very successfully who beat back a much more traditional Republican candidate\nIn the primary so for voters thirty percent of Florida voters that are non party affiliated they did not participate in the August primary you have to be registered in one party or the other to vote right these are this is where the battleground is this is why I say this is not a boulevard type of election there is no middle ground\nThere fighting tooth and nail for each and every one of those votes and they count\nThe last two Florida gubernatorial elections have been decided by fewer than Seventy thousand votes\nOkay well in terms of what they have going for and against them the issues I'm going to come back to you on that but I Do want to get quickly to Georgia and to bill now I got a bill this governor seat the Republicans have held it for decades but you now have a fiery Democrat\nAnd Stacey Abrams who happens to be an African American a woman running against the secretary of state Brian Kemp she's giving him a run for their money what are the main factor is at this point in this race\nIssues have very very tight race according to virtually every poll it's a race of contrast a strong Democrat yes the strong conservative Republican Abrams has been focusing like a laser on a cup\nExpand Medicaid in Georgia and she's focusing on education on public\nEducation so she's been very very focused on issues she's also been a attacking Brian Kemp over issues of voter suppression hum we've got a lot of national attention as you well know Judy or because there are people who think that the secretary of state Brian Kemp now running for governor\nHas over the years excluded people from the voter rolls African Americans who are being denied the right\nTo vote that's somewhat of a known issue here we're not quite sure how methodical and deliberative it's been but certainly the optics suggests that have been some problems there Brian Kemp spin on the attack\nA they debated here last night and Brian Kemp spent a great deal of his time are repeating a theme that he's used throughout the race which is Stacey Abrams is a radical she's too liberal for\nGeorgia she's getting money from national democratic forces outside the states and he's focused on that as a big part of the race\nLet's turn to Wisconsin Frederica fried bird the Republican incumbent Governor Scott Walker is really this is his fourth run if you count the recall election he won in twenty ten and he's run into surprisingly strong opposition from Tony in reverse tell us about this race what are the factors working on both and both sides well\nIt's true of Scott Walker and Tony ... is our in what is projected to be a very tight race I mean uh one or two points race according to experts so Tony ... is the superintendent of public instruction in Wisconsin\nAnd he is a kind of taking this claim to being the education governor a but Scott Walker is now saying that he is the education governor because he infused to his state budget\nWith a new money or for K. twelve schools and so this is something that these candidates have been fighting back and forth over a including a a really a difficult achievement gap racial achievement gap in in the states urban\nSchool districts are which are among the worst in the nation and and each of them are blaming each other over this\nI'll bet yes Scott Walker finds himself in in a a tighter race and then he might have thought he would have had\n... and Tom Hudson back to you on on Florida just quickly what matters most to voters this year how and how much of a factor as President Trump\nPresident Trump visited an enormous factor here in the Florida gubernatorial election I think\nUh there's debate around a pre existing conditions and congressmen to San Francisco position\nFederally on the Affordable CARE Act as it comes to pre existing conditions and of course on the Democratic side Andrew Gillum\nPledging support to expand Medicaid which also has not been expanded here\nIn the state of Florida under the Affordable CARE Act also the environment which traditionally has never been a real a driving motivating issue here but this is another last summer that we've had in Florida we've had blue green algae and Lake Okeechobee the big blue\nLake in the center of the of the state and then we've also had a naturally occurring red tide a more a stronger outbreak of red tide and the Gulf Coast and also on the Atlantic side so it has put water quality front and center or in this gubernatorial campaign for both parties that we haven't seen in elections pass\nThey'll now I got what about issues that factors in the race or in in Georgia and and ... and in particular President Trump\nTrump has not been much of a factor in the general election campaign or he's tweeted a couple of times now his support for Brian Kemp ... to come to us and talk about him a lot\nOn the campaign trail and Stacey Abrams has not been spending a great deal of deal and her time attacking\nHim and I I think the simple reason for that is um Trump won Georgia by five or so points but I think both sides recognize that Trump as we've seen in other races can be as much of a distraction as he is an advantage he might motivate Democrats as much as Republicans\nIn Frederica ... got President Trump is in Wisconsin today\nThat's right in fact his arriving in are the kind of north central part of the state later this afternoon this is a part of the states that Trump won by double digits a and so his visit is expected of course to kind of energize and and boost the Republican base and and that's what a Republicans and Governor Walker\nThe thing we need to do as as Gary said as move away from the idea that this is a a one year problem a two year problem that we can fix with a grant\nWe have to build it into the basic structure of how we finance health care and I would say to chronic pain as well these are problems that are always going to be with us we have to permanently build them and yes that costs money but it will have a huge positive impact on public health and public safety\nGary ... we know that one of the big\nGenesis factors of this epidemic was the over prescription drugs these medications and we are years into this epidemic and yet I still hear stories from good friends whose children have a sports in Jersey injury and they come home with weeks and weeks of opioid pills today in this day do you think we're doing enough\nOn ... on educating doctors about how to prescribe these medications yeah I just want to rephrase that and say it's not what I think\nIt's a fact we're absolutely not doing enough\nWe in the ... and a Fifteen year period\nThe amount of opioid opioids being prescribed on an annual basis four times the amount of debts six times and it's not just court are correlated it's causal everywhere it's everyone agrees\nIt shows that opinion it's not just correlate alliance go just like that together in fact even more on death's so what's happened with prescribing it's come down about twenty five percent and now we are or were thirty percent and now we're three times where we were still three times the amount of opioids as any other country in the world and\nWe have doctors every day is you just said with your friends still prescribing thirty days worth of oxycontin or Viking into Percocet for a sprained ankle or sprained wrist and this is not the dishonest doctors unscrupulous this is good ... these are good doctors we haven't changed with the current science\nAnd we're we there's no way you could say we're doing enough that there's still happens this was eager a bullet spreading across this country we would contain it in a weekend\nGary Humphrey as the legislation has been signed there's maybe a sense of closure to all of this but I'd like to put you back in the position of counseling the house in the Senate and the president from today forward what would you like to see us do\nI Would like us to stop thinking oh this is a crisis meaning a short term issue that will be resolved by\nA couple of years of hard work and instead just be realistic that addiction is part of the fabric of population health\nIt hasn't been a you know for the entire history of our country and it's not going to go away and two or three years we would never have a grant program to take care of cancer for two or three years because we know we're we're always going to people with cancer\nSo what we need to do is bite the bullet\nGoing to programs like Medicaid and Medicare adequately reimburse a treatment\nMake a big investment and training because we need a physicians and nurses and psychologist and other professionals who are trained in this uh taking care of this disorder and just accept this will be part of what the healthcare system does from here on out because right now it's opioids you know ten years from now it's going to be a different drug and we have to be prepared for that\nAll right ... thank you both very much my pleasure thank you thanks Keith [noise]\nThey dedicate their lives just saving others but they can't always save themselves doctors are higher risk of suicide compared to other adults and it turns out

says her father had fallen victim to a medical system that he felt discouraged him from seeking psychiatric care hardest and worried if he got treated for his depression you'd have to disclose it when he renewed his medical license with the board\nAt that time North Carolina asked whether doctors had been treated for mental issues on their application for a medical license or renewal\nSays medical board deals that they are licensing Darrell Issa fair that if\nUndermine anywhere is a doctor and they ... they ... things that hadn't eaten that learning and correctly and not what Russia's result in like near and your name releasing license or you know just possibilities like that were\nTerrified [noise]\nCatherine gold at the University of Michigan studies Dr suicide her research shows that mental health questions on physician license applications keep doctors from seeking counseling while failing to actually identify unstable and unsafe doctors\nJust having a mental health problem doesn't necessarily mean that there are any behavioral problems so I think we're talking conflate that you\nThe boards mission is very simple it's dated in statutes they usually to protect the public against people who should not be practicing medicine\nIn mark ... is executive officer of the Montana board of medical examiner's responsible for licensing doctors Montana was among thirty eight states we found that ask doctors about their mental health when they apply for or renew a medical license\nWith mental health we don't go into specifics that we do want to make sure that our providers are stable individuals uh again to prevent the any harm to patients\nMontana's medical application asks about five years of past psychiatric history but numbers provided by the Montana medical board show out of twenty two applicants who reported mental diagnoses in the past three years none ended up with any impact to their license last\n[noise] that may be a question for the board in our department to review\nIt's a similar story in other states that require disclosure the head of Wyoming's medical board said in my eleven years with the board I cannot recall a single time that the board declined to license a physician or physician assistant on the basis of a disclosed mental health condition\nThere's widespread concern that many of these questions would not hold out that they were challenged in court of law because they're very broad they don't talk about current impairment\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination based on disability including mental health diagnosis state boards and Minnesota and New Jersey changed their mental health questions after Dr successfully argued that the questions were too broad and violated their rights under the ADA\nLast spring medical boards across the nation gathered in Charlotte North Carolina to talk about this\nMedical and occupy the medical boards coming together\nDoctor who even Chaudhry leads the federation of state medical boards favorite accepting the guy the federation advisors states on the best practices for licensing doctors\nIt does have a lot of meaning one of the nation state medical boards of decide to support a particular point of view on anything\nThe group has thirty five recommendations to promote physician wellness topping the list they ask they forced to consider whether it's necessary to ask doctors about mental health at all\nAnd to ensure questions focus on current impairment limiting them to the past two years we've found at least Twenty one state should ask about three or more years of mental health history Catherine ... hopes the report makes state boards go a step further to eliminate questions about mental\nHealth but I tell you as long as the states are
