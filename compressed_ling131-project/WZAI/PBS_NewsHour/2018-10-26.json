less than two weeks before the midterm elections as healthcare has become one of the top issues on the campaign trail we and bring him has our interview with the president's point man on this\nPresident Trump announced several parts of this plan today but here's the fundamental idea Medicare would change how much it pays for some of the most expensive drugs that seniors get a doctor's offices and hospitals\nThe new payments would be based on a benchmark index what some other developed countries pay for the exact same drugs this was all part of a pilot project for Medicare part B as

be here so the president said a very big announcement today he referred to this is a revolutionary change can you explain the basics of of what this does\nYou bet so just this morning we release data showing that in our Medicare program where we pay for these infusion drugs these are the high cost drugs that physicians or hospitals administer to you we are paying one hundred and eighty percent\nCompared to what Europe and Japan are paying for these very same drugs and that can often be as high as five hundred percent higher than what they're getting why different because farm is voluntarily giving these other countries of comparable economic power\nVastly better deals we'd get a bill and we pay the bill actually with a six percent markup on top we're bringing competition at the system by referencing those foreign prices and the deals farmers giving them now and bringing that to the benefit of Medicare and the Medicare beneficiaries make twenty percent of the cost of these drugs out of pocket\nSo you're saying if the Europeans and the Japanese and whoever else can pay X. for this particular cancer drug we want to price similar to that as well\nYou bet 'cause right now in this part of the program this is a government health care program Medicare fee for service for our seniors and these position to minister drugs right now we set a price for it it's just a really stupid price it is the list price plus six percent and we're saying let's introduce some kind of competitive market based\nI right now have to fund the deductibles on all of my people my

Affordable CARE Act maybe try to fix it why throw the baby out with the bathwater make efforts to fix it\nI totally agree and the problem with that is the Democrats don't want to hear anything that President Trump wants to do it all I don't know if that's true\nBut it's a it's a fact I'm not it's not a suggestion for the fact that they have to not be so staunch on if President Trump\nSuggested we say no and they did that with capital they turn down the the candidate before he was even announced what if any impact as a Brett Kavanaugh hearings how long you scared me scared really scared me\nBecause they went way down in what way and could be my son it could be any any person of power that out of the blue us a a an accusation can come out and ruined their life with you because I I

perspective on it would be and I actually know someone in our our group my our immediate friends groups who was their son was falsely accused [noise] um so I see what you're saying but I think that's it I'm not\nI'm not fearful for my son because I Know I Know that the to fix our that when you look at the number of sexual assault accusations and how many are not report in because they're afraid that they won't be believed and they don't report it the number of false accusations is\nMiniscule it's I think less than one percent or one percent\nSo I'm not worried about my son I'm not because I
