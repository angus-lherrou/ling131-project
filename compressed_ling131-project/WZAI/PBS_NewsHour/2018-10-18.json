those victims were girls and women\nBeyond that immigration and guns I think one of the biggest at most interesting items that we've seen in New Jersey is that the voter registration numbers are increasing more than we've ever seen for a mid term we've had a hundred thousand more voters register since January through the end of September I\nDid I Want to talk to you all about the enthusiasm and what you're saying\nAmmar ah it's interesting what's going on here say that at least for competitive races too and uh Minneapolis St Paul suburbs where Republicans are worried Democrats seem to be an stronger shape but out in this in the rural parts of Minnesota it's a different picture tell us what's going on what what's on the minds of voters\nHealthcare for sure and partisanship we are an independent state where unique state we lead the nation and voter turnout in education levels in civic engagement already here absentee voting early voting is up two hundred and thirty five percent\nSo we have an incredibly engaged electorate can we do have fully half\nOf our congressional races are seen as competitive that four out of eight and as you mentioned two of those seats are in rural Minnesota one in northern Minnesota the other end southern Minnesota and then the other two are in suburban areas and it really depends on how the president's playing how issues are playing\nVery interesting competition in a state with an independent streak that uh a while back you know elected a third party governor and former pro wrestler Jesse Ventura\nAnd uh and I do want to ask you about issues there as well but I Want to get to Scott Shafer a and California where you've also got some very interesting congressional races underway what her voters talking about their Scott\nWell first of all Judy there was a real sense of dysfunction in Washington they're tired of the bickering or they feel that a government isn't paying attention to their problems and they want that fixed they want the parties to work together to get things done\nHealthcare is definitely a big issue there are concerns about the Republican tax bill and places like Orange County where many of these competitive races are being held or the tax bill could will hurt people in places like that were home costs are very high incomes are high\nAnd a bit but certainly the Democrats are talking a lot about that there's also a repeal of the gas tax on the statewide ballot here\nA at a horse Orange County which is again where many of these races are playing out very anti tax historically and so Republicans are hoping to use that issue along with immigration a security at the border to get voters to come out to the polls\nAre but I Will say that in terms of fundraising Democrats in this last quarter the third quarter of out raising these competitive races Republicans by five to one and these are all first time candidate Judy all these Democrats they've never run for office before and they're doing really well\nBoth raising money and in the polls where polls show that almost all the seats are very very competitive right now in some cases around the crowd at least one case the Democrats' way ahead right\nSo we're we're talking about issues on them on the minds of voters you started with health care\nWith President Trump is coming up as well uh we know that in a couple of these races where you have a Republican incumbent\nIn in one case with Leonard Lance if someone who hasn't always voted with the president but there there's another race where you have a candidate who has been a Tom MacArthur who's been more ... more pro Donald Trump\nIt's been interesting to see which candidates and depending upon their district lean more toward a advocating for the president's policies that message from Democrats has been we will be the checks and balances on President Trump's hard right agenda\nUh the message from Republicans who know that they have a base as is in the case of the third district with Tom MacArthur is\nI Will stand up for the president's policies for the reasons that you'll elected him\nAnd in that case it still seems to be working up in the eleventh district uh we've been noticing that\nPresident Trump's name is often left out\nA specifically in discussions and in the seventh as you mentioned Judy were actually gearing up to host a debate tonight between Leonard Lance and Tom ... were both candidates are saying hey I'm a moderate on pragmatic on a sensible centrist I'm going to talk to those undecided voters that we have quite a few of\nIn this a suburban area this is a district that particular one where you have really a highly educated voters who also tend to disapprove of the presidents job a job\nYou know so much of it depends on the profile of the district of course and who these voters are and what what they think is in their interest ... hammer quickly uh Minnesota is how much of a factor as President Trump there in these close races house races\nTrump is a big factor in fact he has visited he was just in southern Minnesota down in Minnesota's open congressional district who was visiting the Rochester area and there Jim had during the Republican is running with him he loves the president\nAnd up in the eighth Pete stop or the Republican they're also running with the president appearing with the president\nThe interesting part is approval numbers are different in those two regions in northern Minnesota is known as the iron range steel tariffs appear to be fairly popular their governors rating the president's ratings are holding their butt in southern Minnesota soybean territory soybean farmers there appear to be pretty displeased\nWith the soybean tariffs so the president appears to be helping Republicans in northern Minnesota but potentially hurting Republicans in southern Minnesota and then we\nThe Republicans is running with the present the other is not congressman Erik Paulsen in the suburbs not running with the president and then Congressman Jason Lewis said yeah I like when you can do and maybe don't always like his style but he says his policies are working so it really depends on where you are in Minnesota\nSo interesting to get this picture of the whole country finally quickly let me come back to you Scott Shafer on we know the president I had played a different role in California he uh is not as popular isn't in some other parts of the country but there are parts of your state where he is\nAbsolutely Donald Trump won twenty eight or so of California's shifty three counties is just the you know a lot of people don't live there but in these in these competitive races these districts were talking about Donald Trump is not particularly popular\nA and the candidates Republicans are not mentioning him a President Trump is not coming out here to campaign or raise money\nYou're going to Nevada next door Arizona but not to California I think they've decided that is not helpful to have him out your it'll always turn out the ah the Democratic vote more so are we seeing Obama and Biden out here a campaigning for Democrats but so far Mike Pence was there a while ago but no President Trump\nFascinating well we still have almost three weeks ago and we're going to be watching all of these house races between now and then and certainly on election night\nScott Shafer ... uh in California brown of a nosy with New Jersey a TV ... n J TV and New Jersey in Maryland hammer Twin Cities in Minnesota thank you\nThank you [noise]\n\nAs we reported earlier journalist Jamal ... disappearance is leading to an array of difficult questions for the president and about the United states' political relationship with Saudi Arabia may U.S companies have long had business ties with the Saudis\nAnd as William Wrangham explains those corporations now have to answer their own questions about whether they will continue to conduct business as usual with a kingdom\nIs a big investment conferences Saudi Arabia and next week it's been dubbed the Davos in the desert conference and initially a number of prominent us executives plan to attend but then ... showed you disappeared and the Saudis claim no knowledge of what happened to him\nNow a number of those executives have pulled out they include J. P. Morgan CEO Jamie diamond Ford Motor German bill Ford and over CEO Dara Khosrowshahi but a number of business leaders will\nThe U.S treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin today when President Trump was again after the boat to show me he emphasized America's economic ties with Saudi Arabia\nAnd there was tremendous purchaser\nOf not only military equipment but other things when I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of military\nThose are the biggest orders of the history of this country probably the history of the world I don't think there's ever been any order for four hundred and fifty billion dollars and you remember that day in Saudi Arabia where that commitment was made\nTo help go a little deeper into those economic ties and how corporations are responding to this crisis I'm joined now by Andrew Ross Sorkin he's an editor and columnist for the New York times and also the co host of CNBC squawk box he himself was scheduled to go to the Saudi Arabia conference but recently pulled out\nI'm Andrew I'm thank you very much for being here I Know you've been reporting a great deal about these decisions made by CEOs to pull out\nA can you just tell me what was their calculus well\nThis is turned out to be a remarkable crucible a for business executives in the United states and really around the world um in terms of\nNot only going to Riyadh next week but what going to Riyadh would represent an endorsement if you will of the kingdom and so many of these executives whether it's J. P. Morgan or Blackstone or black rock or rubber\nHave real business interests in Saudi Arabia so there is something meaningful for all of them at risk\nRuben Gallego Jason Kander would admit that he's certainly looking for post traumatic growth and had some but also dealing with post traumatic stress disorder and when he wrote his letter he said that he was worried about admitting\nHis pain TST or because it might hurt his political future does that signify that we're still not quite comfortable enough as a society talking about the testy\nCertainly and I think ... I think people have to understand you can be successful both you know all aspects of your life in nature and still have the TST and many people do that I I feel like I'm One of those people I hear this from police officers here this from fire men are the guys that I served in Iraq\nOr that wanted later joined the CIA FBI\nUm you know or wanted to be ... air pilots there's this rumor that is very pervasive among the Marines that if you are diagnosed ... you're not going to be allowed to have these sensitive jobs um you know for us politicians yeah it's a worry but for everyday working men and women and it's a real worry it's a real worry about their career that affects their career advancement\nAh and I think that's why it's important that you know Jason myself and Brian role models\nAre to all these men and women because if we can admit they ...\nTalking about it it's going to make it more difficult for them to do that when they have a lot more to lose and they're not like I have an election to lose a but these men and women are you know can lose or whole livelihood and the whole future or in and especially if they don't actually get treated a further ...\nAnd Brian Ross quickly on the time we have left if not only the people who are already in the spotlight but the record number of veteran candidates or this year do you think that could help\nAbsolutely you know anytime you're bringing awareness to this issues which is what you're doing right now which is what's been going on in Congress in other places whether it's the look at the suicide rates out there or the way that we can help our veterans coming home to to find work to reintegrate into society to make sure that they have healthy relationships with their families\nThere is a very active effort not just at the governmental front at the nonprofit fraud at the community level front to make sure that this occurs people care about our veterans today\nIn a way that is so very very obvious and it makes a difference in the life of every veteran it made a difference in my life I think I can speak for Ruben ... made a difference in his life as well and this is something that's important and we should all be proud about today\nBrian mass Republican from Florida a room and guy or go Democrat from Arizona thank you very much to both thank you [noise]\nNow let's turn to immigration and the president's approach to it which is once again stirring up concern as a mid term elections approach us border patrol agents arrested more than sixteen thousand family members in September according to a new report from the Washington Post\nThat is a record high since President Trump officially ended a policy of separating families at the border\nThe relatives spike and border crossings kamikaze administration ways new steps to discouraging deter cross border flow including what some are calling family separation two point oh\nThe latest on what we know I'm joined by on the boss on the he'd been following all this so since the president did announce officially in July of this policy was ending we know the administration has been working what were the ACLU other groups to try to take care of these children but\nDo we know having done that do we know how many are still in custody\nStill have to go for sure and I remember even before the president ordered the end of family separation it took a federal judge coming in and saying you have to stop it and you have to reunite these families that was June ...\nWeeks and they're still children and US government care in custody\nThey're trying to reunite how many well the government so number say there are sixty six kids in their care today that they are currently working to reunite one under the age of five as well we should point out\nWhy are they still in custody for the vast majority of them fifty of those children their parents were already deported and that presents a huge logistical challenge first you have to find the parents\nThen you have to contact them then you have to ask if they want their children sent back to the same country they were fleeing the government the ACLU or working through that right now but it's also disturbing to point out the ACLU says there are still five children whose parents they have been unable to contact for talking about five kids who could be permanently orphaned\nAs a result of U.S policy so twenty five hundred or so originally they're down to sixty six clearly there's been some a lot of progress\nBut they still have work to do they do and it's important to point out look sixty six kids they say they're still working to reunite\nOur review the numbers show there's another two hundred and fifty children still in government care who they are not working to reunite for a number of reasons and those reason his\nRace some more questions these are cases in which they were separated from someone other than a parent a grandparent or an older sibling cases in which the government says the parent is unfit to be reunited but they will provide a lot of details are cases in which the parrot was deported and then the government said well look the parents we contacted them and they said they don't want the child\nBrought back to the same country in which they were fleeing the conditions in the first place um we should also the immigration advocates on the front lines they're worried the government's under reporting some of the separated family numbers are basing that and what they've heard and seen on the front lines and the government's own watchdog agency homeland security is watchdog agency last month\nIssued a pretty damning report slamming the government for the inconsistency\nIn numbers and the lack of transparency that than what they were giving their own investigators and there is confusion because as you said the sixty six but then as you said they're still others who are ill in government in a ... a feeling government care\nSo the president was asked about all this yesterday he did an interview with the Associated Press he seemed to say that most of these children who would come across the border at either come alone or they were with smugglers and he went on to say that this\n... family separation policy was meant to be a deterrent\nWhat is the evidence show has it been just so the president's absolutely right that the government right now has thousands of migrant children and they're carrying capacity and the vast majority of them arrived alone those kids tend to be older they tend to have been\nViolent they tend to arrive kind of knowing what to expect they have contact information of family members they know they'll go into a shelter and then be reunited the president's\nWrong though to indicate that the majority of the children that they separated under zero tolerance that the majority of them came with smugglers or traffickers that's just not true and the government's own numbers bear that out\nPresidents also wrong and it's apparent belief that\nFamily separation worked at a time as a deterrent the numbers don't show that as you talked about earlier the latest border crossings actually show a short term spike and I say short term because important to remember and all of this is that historically\nBorder crossings are at a low if you take a look at a graph like this that goes back to two thousand over the last Twenty years or so look Twenty years ago border crossings month by month\nAround Seventy eighty sometimes two hundred thousand a month so today Fifteen sixteen thousand sounds like a lot but it's still a historic low\nNow finally and just quickly we're we are starting to hear about another policy the administration is considering we we called it may be a two point oh what what do we know about\nIt last week there was a report the government's considering putting a choice before parents when they crossed the border and basically saying look you can either keep your child with you and federal detention which is not designed to house children waved their protection under a child welfare law\nOr willingly be separated let your child be taken from you and go into a government shelter that's designed for children now I asked the official about this endless told look we're going to uh do whatever we need to do to humanely enforce the law to secure our borders and that there'll be looking at a range of options we should point out\nThis is a policy they actually floated back in July they put it before the judge who was overseeing reunification so the government feels like they thought a judge to sign off\nIf they need to use it they will uh we should also say immigration advocates say if they decided to put it in place\nThere's going to be a flurry of litigation similar to what we saw after the original family separation policy\nSo much to keep track of and really important to continue to follow this on an of
