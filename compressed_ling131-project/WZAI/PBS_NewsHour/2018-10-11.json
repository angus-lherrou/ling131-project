Florida governor Rick Scott had already said the state was gearing up for what happened after the worst of Michael has\nWe work around the clock to make sure that roads and bridges reopen as quickly as possible [noise] we have trucks loaded with tons of food water and other critical supplies ready to move in\nThe storm is also on a path to plow across Georgia and then through south and North Carolina both still recovering from last month's Hurricane Florence wins will\nBe strong enough to bring down trees weakened by Florence especially with saturated grill when ... was strong enough to rip charge from Ruth ... ... homes damaged by Florence\nFEMA poverty coping with the aftermath of Florence is warning that recovery from Michael could be slow\nIt is here again and I keep saying his word for us too much is unprecedented so it's going to be a major hit the power is going to be all for multiple weeks and you need to get your mind set set on that and do what you can prepare to overcome that\nFrom the oval office today President Trump promised a full federal aid to storm victims he said he will probably visit Florida to see the damage on Sunday for Monday\nAnd for the latest on hurricane Michael and where it's headed over the next twenty four hours we're joined again tonight I can grant director of the national Hurricane Center and joins me from Miami, Florida grand thanks for making the time tell us now we're talking to a little after five pm eastern\nWhat's the latest that we know about the strength and the intensity of this storm\nWe got some brand new information that that just came in were looking at still wins over a hundred and twenty five miles an hour which is you know incredible since we're already inland so you still have some of those hurricane force winds\nYou know we're looking at a movement still about sixteen miles an hour or so of course was speeding up with time so luckily we're not getting some of those high rainfall told us but we are having some issues of course with the wind you know being\nIt's a stretch into central portions of Georgia so not just a coastal of as you're going to get some trees down and some power outages even stretching into central Georgia\nTalking about this hurricane force winds even further inland the foreign made landfall a lot of people were talking about this being a worst case scenario store and if that's still the case where does most of the danger lie\nYeah you know a lot of it was you know of course the winds when you have a system that strong you know you're going to have ones that are just absolutely destructive so I I think we once we start seeing some of the damage areas you'll see some of the structural damage collapsed buildings and and rooftops in trees down power outages per week\nBut what always scares me on these events without a doubt is the storm surge because it's the half of the faith tallies in these tropical systems as the storm surge\nAnd if you look at water in general including the inland flooding you start getting Ninety percent of the ... so we've had some reports of some very large storm surge and these are the updated values we just updated these a little bit ago and you know you push all that water and with all that force in the hurricane force winds\nAnd it's just every little channel every little river fills up well in some cases ten to Fifteen miles it takes time it really takes a lot of time now that the wind relaxes it takes time to train all of that out there so the values are going to stay high\nThe water is always the most dangerous part of these\nAnd tell us about the past and where does the storm had\nYeah next we're looking at a continuing to to move to the to the northeast and if you think about this is interesting so at some point will continue to be a hurricane and eventually a tropical storm continuing to be a tropical storm\nOut through the Carolinas and actually editing back into the Atlantic so as a as an interesting case here you know you think about the flow around um a Michael you have some onshore flow we actually have tropical storm warnings even from from Georgia the Carolinas so you know this is becoming an adult plant that gives you too\nCan grant at the national Hurricane Center thanks for your time\nYou about\nNow a closer look at the impact of hurricane Michael so far Panama City beach is getting hit hard and I spoke with Mayor Mike Thomas lifestyle in this afternoon as the storm with making landfall\nWe've had quite a bit of that but we actually I think we're going to get less than a big deal with the strength of this storm and all in Panama City beach I think that much in Mexico beach in St Joe go get a little or is it job just a little bit\nTo the east before it hit us and um\nOn the news hour questions mountains in the disappearance of Saudi dissidents demolish Yogi\nThe president announces a major change in ethanol gasoline rules in an effort to help farmers in refugee camps in Bangladesh real anger women bearing babies born from ray\n\nThe case of a missing journalists could have a major impact on the United states relationship with historic ally Saudi Arabia\nDemolished show he has not been seen for more than a week when he entered the Saudi conflict is tumble Saudi Arabia is that it doesn't know where he is a Turkish officials say he was murdered and that the accusation has led to a new effort today on Capitol Hill that could end sanctions on Saudi Arabia\nNext different starts our coverage\nThe last time ... was seen alive he walked into Saudi Arabia is is stumble consulate thinking he was safe\nThe fifty nine year old prominent journalist had told friends not to worry his fiance waited outside expecting them to emerge with papers allowing them to marry but just hours before Fifteen Saudis flew in Istanbul to be what a Turkish officials to local media was a hit squad\nNewspaper close to the government reported the men had connections with Saudi military and intelligence and it also published their movements including one of the planes they used to arrive that morning and leave that night\nTurkish officials told international media these men likely killed ... on orders from Saudi leadership and dismembered his body with a saw six year old\nFrom Comey has show he used to be a Saudi Government advisor and always supported modernization effort led by Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... known as MPs\nHe is doing what we do minded him to do the ... it might be in critical to believe because he is doing things that ... ...\nHe opposed the MPs his tactics but our show he described as a crackdown on criticism including female activists who've been arrested for show you said Mohammed bin saw him on diet food descent\nSo they invited went ... low for ... ... ... ... ... a discourse about lively monitor monitor ... doesn't affect us for the future\nAnd I've never been more stir them right now Republican lawmakers have traditionally declined to criticize us ally Saudi Arabia\nBut in a letter released today Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker and other leading senators triggered a process that automatically imposes sanctions on Saudi Arabia if it murder ... and all of us are taking it very seriously and\nAnd um and you know urging\nCapitol Hill skepticism has been rising with civilian casualty reports from Yemen with the U.S supports the Saudi Arabia led coalition fighting Iran backed rebels but the reports about democracy ... are pushing lawmakers to increase pressure on the ... the administration is beginning to respond to\nA White House statement said national security adviser John Bolton senior advisor Jared Kushner and secretary of state Mike Pompeo talk with Mohammed bin some on end quote\nAsk for more details and for the Saudi Government to be transparent investigation process and President Trump increase the pressure on Saudi Arabia when he said he wanted to me I'll show these fiance who appealed to the president and a lot of your Trump in a Washington Post op ed\nWe're in contact with her now and we want to bring it to the White House well I have to find out who did it but uh\n[noise] people so I'm go in but they didn't see him come out as they understand it and we're going to take a look at it is a terrible thing have you spoken to the Saudi I'd rather not say with the answer is yes\nWe take a deeper look at what this could mean for us and Saudi relations with Senator Chris Murphy a Democrat from Connecticut He sits on the Foreign Relations committee center thank you so much\nFor joining us today uh the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the ranking member and you have been working on a letter that has just been released I Wonder if that letter say what kind of pressure you trying to put on the administration\nSo uh under existing a global human rights law passed by the Congress assigned by the president of the ranking Democrat and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have the ability to ask\nThe administration to come to a finding on a potential gross violation of human rights abroad and that's what this letter asks for the president to make a determination as to whether ... was indeed executed by the Saudis as has been alleged\nUh now I think you have to take this letter with a grain of salt because it is asking the administration that has shown very little interest in getting to the bottom of the story to come up with a definitive finding which they may be unlikely to do but at least it requires\nThe administration to now go through a process by which they will have to do some fact finding a to discover a weather as we believe the Saudis executed is journalist\nThat process lasts about a hundred and twenty days\nSpecter or perhaps do you hope that sanctions will be imposed on Saudi Arabia or to show them that there are consequences if indeed democracy Yogi was murdered\nSo if those sanctions half to be triggered by a presidential finding then my expectations are low I I think the Trump Administration has not shown much interest in trying to\nFigure out what happened here and of course we know that there is this\nA deep and unconditional bond that has been created between the Trump Administration and the Saudi royal family that I imagine the administration is not going to be interested in breaking so if we are to impose sanctions or have some consequences for the potential murder of his journal is probably going to have to be Congress\nActing on its own so I'm Glad this process is taking place I was glad to sign a letter but I also don't have high expectations that the administration is going to trigger sanctions\nThis letter demands additional sanctions but do you think in the meantime oriented edition us should for example cut off arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nI think it's time for us to cut off arms sales I'm I'll be honest I've argued that we should do that separate and aside from the allegations concerning this journalist hum but we're going to have\nTo send some signal in the short term\nThat the deliberate targeting of a journalist a U.S resident journalists is unacceptable it may take a long time for the administration to work through a sanctions regime a week and take the immediate step as Congress of suspending arms sales to the Saudis I think that that would be\nUm I think that's worthy of discussion and the Foreign Relations committee and the upcoming days and weeks\nBut zoom out here to talk about the region and us Saudi relations or the U.S ministry rations priorities\nAre in the middle east to counter Iran counter violent extremism to get to some kind of a temp for an Israeli Palestinian peace deal Saudi Arabia is critical for all those three things so why do you ah have some criticism administration for leaning on Saudi Arabia for using Saudi Arabia as the lynchpin across the region\nNo doubt that Saudi Arabia has been key in creating a kind of taunting the region between the Sunni nations and Israel um but on our other two objectives are the nature of the U.S Saudi alliance today is actually running counter\nTo our state of goals in the region of by backing the Saudis play in Yemen for instance we're actually making Iran stronger\nUnder the deeper Iran gets involved in the who the resistance there\nAnd we are actually helping of funds are radical groups all around the world by continuing this alliance with the Saudis who quietly funnel money to an\nIntolerance brand of Islam ... that forms the building blocks of a lot of these Sunni extremist groups around the world so unfortunately I think the nature of our alliance with the Saudis actually runs contrary to\nMany of our goals in the middle east\nI've asked for any officials and department of defense about the war in Yemen and they say that look\nYou know Saudi Arabia isn't perfect of course there have been civilian casualty incidents inside Yemen but they are our ally we need to stand by them and they are on the same side as us when it comes to Yemen do you believe that Saudi Arabia is on the same side ...\nNo I don't think they're on the same side and I think that they've been misrepresenting the nature of the war inside Yemen they've been telling us that they're not trying to hit civilians when the evidence is to the contrary\nThe evidence tells us that they are targeting civilians that they are targeting civilian infrastructure if not that they're missing their targets that they're actually\nHitting their targets and I I think if if it turns out that they've been lying to us over the last few days about the murder of ... which\nI Would argue they probably have then then I think that's a further evidence to tell us that they are also not telling us the truth\nWhen it comes to the way in which targeting is conducted inside Yemen and all the evidence tells us that they've been trying to hit civilians and they've been succeeding\nA and we should withdraw from our military partnership inside Yemen because we should never be part of any military campaign even if it's with a name to ally in which civilians are the target\nSo much that I noticed some changes in my body I wasn't getting my period I realized I was pregnant I give up yeah\nShe
