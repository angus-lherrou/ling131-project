P. L. and public radio in Nashville, Tennessee we welcome all three of you to the news hour Christopher con over let's start with you in Arizona What our voters talking about what are they focused on in the Senate race\nThe big focus here is immigration in many ways because Arizona is a border state\nUh I'm In Tucson which is one of the larger cities in the states we're less than a hundred miles sixty to Seventy miles from the border so the border is always an issue even a local races here certainly in a federal read the other issues are the same that we hear across the country with a health

general nationwide to challenge the current administration policies that is put more focus on races this November\nMichigan is one of thirty attorney general races on the ballot this November it's one of a competitive race is being closely watched right now there are twenty seven Republican attorneys general twenty two Democrats with one appointed by an independent governor and if Democrats can

discrimination on the job women working while pregnant\nPlus the pick of the month author Nate blank slate on American War [noise]\nBut first we turn to the pressure on intention inside Saudi Arabia today is stumbles chief public prosecutor said the Saudi journalist your mouth I show Jay was strangled as soon as he added the Saudi consulate there\nTurkey has been ratcheting up pressure on Saudi Arabia and ethnic shepherd reports and the U.S is increasing its own pressure by focusing on the Saudi led coalition fighting in Yemen\nAnd sales weapons to that coalition but yesterday for the first time secretary of defense James Mattis set a deadline for the fighting to stop\nMy main thirty days from now we want to see everybody around the peace table based on a ceasefire based on a pull back from the border and then based on she seen dropping a bomb\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo also said it's time to end the war Saudi officials have admitted they're facing a crisis the country and its leadership are opaque so we wanted to take a look inside the kingdom which for decades has been ruled by one family\nIt all started in Nineteen thirty two when Abdulazeez events out founded the modern state after he died power transferred through six sons from brother to brother to the current king saw him on\nBut instead of choosing another brother is their parents in twenty Fifteen for the first time so I'm an chose the next generation\nVersus nephew Mohammed bin ... and then switch to his favorite son thirty three year old Mohammed and sell them on notice NBS king sol moms younger brother had been up to these didn't swear allegiance to NBS and moved to London but this week he dramatically return to Riyadh\nRussell was also\nAs crown prince NBS along to the massive modernization campaign allowing women to drive alone reducing the power of ultra conservative clerics and tried to wean the kingdom away from oil those changes are popular and they've helped cement NBS control\nBut he's also neutralize his rivals imprisoning other princes and the Riyadh Ritz Carlton and he's accused of involvement in the murder of journalists ... [noise]\nHe is also led to war in Yemen cause the world's worst humanitarian crisis but NBS has his father the kings support and controls the defense ministry and economic foreign and domestic policies that means finding an alternative is purposely difficult and what the Saudi founder who could be ruled by consent\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nNation he's the author of Saudi Arabia and the politics of dissent and Robin Wright is a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for scholars and a contributing writer to the New Yorker magazine thanks so much\nTo you both for being here I'm going to find the if I could start with you there has been a lot of talk of course the NBS himself had something to do which amount of show she's murder is there pressure uh for NBS the somehow stepped down a or a will he survive\nBut I I think it's the the situation in Saudi Arabia is is is very fluid but I I think the main authority of the whole political order\nRisk with the king of Saudi Arabia and everybody follows a the gang the legitimacy of the crown prince comes from being the son of the ... I think if the ... the size to remove him he\nAh he has the authority to do so and nobody would object you moved to other ground ... before him so uh is there pressure for that I don't think internally that his pressure for about\nA certainly externally a there is a lot of pressure for though\nRobin Wright mounting external pressure but also internal pressure or not\nI think there is but monitor and saw him on his also consolidated power as knowing beforehand ever managed to do except for the founder he took over the intelligence and military apparatus he's head of the economic council he's head of the royal court and so the idea that there\nCould be divisions within that could challenge him I think it's more difficult than in the past ah but\nIt really depends on how much pressure the royal family particularly the king himself\nFeels to whether it's weaken the powers of the crown prince replaced him a there are a number of different options including bringing others who might share power take over some of his portfolio um put him in check in effect so that he isn't\nThe only power in the kingdom\nAmong funny we just saw prints off med return the kings brother uh is that an attempt to consolidate power around and B. S.\n[noise] I think a princess is a very important figure if you use the unnatural number two after ... how the process gone lateral instead of vertical the way it happened this time\nPassing the throne of Saudi Arabia king presided as a lot of support internally from that drives the religious establishment of the commercial glasses I think that a turnover of Brits mood is very important for the consolidation of power and making a\nBasically a beginning a for the base which is the ruling family and a delicious establishment and emotion class so\nHe will support MPs\nIt still is in a much more complicated than that I think he would support the king but I'm not sure if he would support\nA the crown prince Robin Wright can print offered help circle the wagons\nOh I think he's already begun to do that I think he's gaming his future already uh what was really interesting is that he showed up at the airport to greet prince Ahmed might have been among showed up to ... ... ... yeah it's and it's very interesting I think that uh he's doing those things that\nTried to show that he's still in power that he's still popular and I think he really was popular among the young before this happened you look at the way it was created in the United states I think that they show the merger murder has in many ways backfired in ways that he he never anyone who was linked to it\nEver envisioned so I think the crown prince is a feeling vulnerable and trying to do those things that will lift his profile and show that he's in control and not I'm not associated with this murder\nOr who founded the crown prince is as vulnerable as Robin Wright said or is that why we are seeing this pressure from the United states over the war in Yemen or or is it just a a confluence of events the un has been saying that the ceasefire needs to begin in November\nIf they get the permits and they start mining cross the street for me I'd probably move jak hazing is determined to do what he wants with his land\nThey can't stop or from mining because we got property rush you don't go burn or dark and do my land\nAnd we get the word ... governing back and do my land\nWe are in bad shape in this country\nOne thing is for sure phosphate mining in central Florida continues so those ships stocks are going to get even taller for the PBS NewsHour I'm Laura Newberry in stark Florida [noise]\nNow the problem of bias against pregnant women in the workplace today marks the fortieth anniversary of a law known as the pregnancy discrimination act\nThe law has been crucial making it illegal for employers to deny a woman a job promotion or higher pay because she's pregnant but a new investigation has found there are important gap in the workplace where this is not\nAre difficult with physically demanding jobs that is the focus of what William rang and explores tonight and a note for viewers this conversation discusses sensitive subjects\nWarehouses or some of the fastest growing workplaces in America employing more than a million people as part of an ongoing series about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace\nThe New York times discovered somewhere houses were pregnant women allege that their requests for lighter duties were rejected and they then had miscarriages the times report focused on a ledge troubles with one warehouse in Memphis, Tennessee\nIt's currently owned by a company known as ... feel logistics which owns supply chain warehouses used by many name brand corporations several women say they had miscarriages after what they alleged was harsh treatment at that facility ... denies all these allegations\nBut we are going to talk about one of these cases and that the larger picture here beyond just one company ... had a miscarriage while employed at that warehouse in Memphis shortly before ex field bought it in twenty fourteen she's now with the Teamsters which is trying to organize a union at the same warehouse\nAnd for Tim ... graves is the c._e._o. of the national Women's Law center welcome to both ...\nI'm ... I Wonder if you could just start off by telling us a little bit about what happened with you I Know you were working in this warehouse while you were pregnant back in twenty fourteen what kind of work were you doing back then\nWe um process boxes process um items that I'm calmed down a conveyor belt I'd rather they found tablets um gadgets or whatnot is very challenging um\nIs there a hot and they're building and we do not have air uh we live boxes forty five pounds or more um and that's picking them up there for them\nAnd I understand that the time but this was causing some discomfort for you how did you did you express that your supervisor\nAbsolutely on February ... fourteen I found out that I was pregnant\nI merely immediately went to the doctor he could on my doctor no no heavy lifting my supervises filed that no but she disregarded then now because she's still sent me to areas where I had when I had to pick up forty five pound boxes and heavy your boss is\nSaid look I've got a doctor's note saying I'm not supposed to lift heavy things\nCan I Do something different what was what was the supervisors reaction\nYes idea requests um lighter duty because it is light duty of that company accommodates who they want to accommodate um\nSo I did ask for light duty and I did on sale not supervisor that I could not live heavy boxes she said to me that I should have a an abortion and I just\nLooked at her 'cause I was so\nShocked that she told me to have a freaking abortion so she eventually walked away from me I stayed at work maybe\nFifteen minutes later I was hurting so bad I went oh I went to sleep but when I got up the next morning my mattress was like dressed in blood\nOn my husband was there my two kids was there and there were like mom what's wrong with my husband was like so shocked he didn't know what to do you know me crying in pain so he rushed me to the E R\nUm I got to the ER and\nThe doctor examined me in shape me and everything he was like sorry I'm missing the rail but it's nothing we can do your miss carrying now you just have to let it take its course\nI'm terribly sorry about you having to experience so I Know you've heard this already the supervisor at the times says that's never what you said you the company is denied all of these allegations they've sent us a statement that said\nWe were starting to learn about miss morals laws and twenty fourteen while we can't speak to what happened at this site before we bought it we've created a culture that is strongly grounded in dignity and respect or workplace pregnancy a combination policies exceed what is legally required they also allege that\nThe Teamsters Union for whom you know work is is stirring up these stories to make the company look bad and I'm just curious what your reaction is to that when you hear that statement\nThey're lying because again that supervise and not only told me that but it was\nSound real four or five women there was pregnant at the same time that I was pregnant it was like a trickle down effect I mean it and to try to put it on the Teamsters no one was affiliated with a team says I now work for the team so to speak\nAllow anyone to downgrade the Teamsters because they are the ones that gave us a platform that gave the voices of voice so I feel like this is a very disrespectful to try to blame someone for their mistakes\nI Want to turn ... graves when you hear a story like this when I read about her story in the New York times and about allegations of this kind of behavior going on in in in other warehouses [noise]\nThe thing that really struck me is that I thought surely this kind of treatment of a pregnant woman asking for lighter duty when she has a doctor's recommendation that that should be a legal requirement but it's not\nYou know what I'm so grateful for a toss it and the other pregnant workers for speaking out because forty years after Congress first passed the pregnancy discrimination act you would think that this wouldn't be a problem what happened\nWas a few years ago there was a Supreme Court decision that limited the interpretation that basically made it harder for pregnant workers when they need accommodations to get them\nAnd there have been a huge backlash to that decision we have had over Eighteen states passed new laws to be more directed to sort of say actually pregnant workers shouldn't have\nTo choose between having a healthy pregnancy and being able to stay on the job and get the income that they need which is the really terrible choice people are having to make right now\nSo does the law currently say what is protected under law and what is not\nWell pregnant workers should know that they cannot experience discrimination on the job so I don't want to put out misinformation on that\nBut the real challenge is around when you need an accommodation not all pregnant workers are going to need that many people when I was pregnant at my job which is really 'cause she had a desk I didn't actually need any accommodation and with my way but sometimes you do and we hear from workers who need really basic things sometimes they just need to ...\nTo go to the bathroom and they need to or be able to have water or working as a cashier be able to have a story so they're not standing all day unfortunately what the Supreme Court said is that\nAn employer can make a determination that it isn't going to provide that accommodation if it's if it's an unnecessary burden for them\nSeems to be a perverse incentive in the law which says that if you provide an accommodation for someone then you're required to provide for pregnant women or other women who asked for it it seems to be incentivizing people\nAnd unfortunately a lot of employers have\nGotten more rich hadn't had made and working conditions if he says for everyone and so they say we treat everyone equally bad\nAnd that is our will well pat isn't a good role for anyone and you know the conditions that she described it with the heat conditions that at our is with outbreaks all of those things that they should be really fixing for all workers but certainly for workers can eat them\nAll right for Tim ... graves and toss your morel thank you both very much\n[noise]\nFinally tonight Jeffrey Brown has the latest author conversation from our new is our New York Times Book club
