done on every car must be by workers earning sixteen dollars an hour in addition it increases labor rights environmental an intellectual property protections\nBy the way without tariffs we wouldn't be talking about a deal\nMr Trump pointed to his willingness to play hardball as a key factor he had previously threatened tariffs on autos an auto parts from Canada in August he announced a bilateral deal with Mexico threatening to leave out Canada entirely\nThen just before midnight deadline on Sunday the administration announced Canada would be part of a new trial lateral deal in Ottawa Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau praised the agreement as modernizing NAFTA he acknowledged the talks were\nRenegotiating NAFTA or has been a challenge in conversations with the president with the

legislature will also have to approve it\nPrivately administration officials say they are confident Congress will ratify the deal but publicly President Trump express some doubt especially if Democrats take back one or both chambers in the mid term elections\nThey might be willing to throw one of the great deals for people and the workers they may be willing to do that for political person you know people are political purposes\nIf the deal does win approval\nMany of the provisions wouldn't take effect until twenty twenty [noise]\nWe'll take a closer look at what the deal does and does not do right after the news summary in the days other news President Trump said the FBI should be comprehensive but quick as it looks into sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nHe said that includes interviewing anyone they want within reason some Democrats have claimed the White House is limiting the scope of the pro White House correspondent Michele send

like a three ways the roads in [noise]\nGot in line and there were many lethal threat says well this is the patrol boat neighborhoods and it was consumed by a poppy fields that the earthquake lifted and to move to more than a kilometer\nWe certainly want the FBI to do a real investigation and uh we are working to make sure that that happens\nThe Republican who pressured the president in approving the pro Senator Jeff flake of Arizona also raised concerns today about as thorough now have you spoken Boston where protesters heckled him and demanded he opposed Kavanaugh's nomination\nIt does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out what we can find out some\nWitnesses or potential witnesses may not want to cooperate a but for those that can and those who we can compel to cooperate ah we've got to do a false from investigation\nSoon after the New York times reported the president has now directing the FBI to interview anyone it seems necessary so long as the review is finish by friday agents are now expected to question Christine Blasey Ford who testified Thursday\nShe said when they were teenagers Kavanaugh assaulted her yesterday FBI agents spoke with another accuser Debbie Ramirez according to reports she alleges at a party when they were students at Yale Kavanaugh exposed himself\nIt's still unclear whether the third woman will be question Julie sweating it has a cues cabinet of drug in girls so they could be getting raped in high school the FBI also have started questioning Kavanaugh's high school friend mark judge Christine Blasey Ford says he was in the room when she was attacked\nMeanwhile new questions have emerged over whether Kavanaugh lied during his Senate testimony about his drinking on Sunday ... became the second of Kavanaugh's yell classmates to say he was quote a heavy drinker in college\nHe also said Kavanaugh at times became belligerent and aggressive one drunk President Trump was question today about what would happen if investigators find evidence that Kavanaugh lied under oath\nCertainly if they find something I'm going to take that into consideration absolutely I I have a very open mind\nIn the meantime debate on Kavanaugh's nomination resumed this afternoon on the Senate floor\nWe all saw something about that Kavanaugh's temperament and character that day that should disqualify him from serving on the Supreme Court of the United states he was angry he was villager and he was part of a sudden\nHe went on the attack against senators questioning him these qualities we look for in a Supreme Court justice for a judge for that matter\nIn my judgment the pattern of behavior was saying confirmed for Democrats all public but most of ...\n\nThey're committed the lawyer obstructing and resisting arrest of all the diversion with everything they ... they just want to ...\nThe Senate is expected to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination shortly after the FBI wraps up its investigation\nAnd you may shift here with me now you makes you heard the president expressed support judge Kavanaugh he also said he has an open mind\nFor its support for his candidate the White House currently is standing very very firm with\nBrett Kavanaugh president gave a very vigorous defense of him um and the White House today was sending out statements from Brett Kavanaugh's friends and former classmate that yeah they all say that Brett Kavanaugh did not blackout drunk when they weren't when they knew him they also said that he treated women very respectfully but that of course\nI mean it's a cabinet who say that he did get very drunk and then he was very aggressive all that's happening while the president is also saying that he doesn't want to look at any people else doesn't want to look at any replacement but we all know that there's a long list of\nPeople that he that the president put out of about maybe ten names of people who could possibly be other people that he would nominate so I just out there the president has that the other thing that's really important as the president said that he was very surprised by how local Brett Kavanaugh was about his drinking and the president made sure to note that he himself has never even drink a beer\nAnd that's again showing that Brett Kavanaugh is a very different person Donald Trump who's older brother friday Trump died in his forties from alcoholism so there's a real personal connection there with President Trump in June and drinking and it could open up the door\nObviously no one knows where the investigation is going to go but we know the White House for syndicated it should be limited to that now seems to be broadening a that scope how involved is the White House and actually setting parameters what the FBI is looking into\nWell it's clear that the White House wants to be small and it wants it to be quick all that said President Trump really has the power to do whatever he wants to do in terms of of the FBI up and talking to sources who say the FBI isn't that the executive\nBranch and the president is within his authority to say you need to talk to these two women and that's it and today at the press conference he was pretty clear with the fact that he thought dining room mirrors and\nDr fortunately the people that the FBI should be focused on what all with all that his hand is really being forced by Jeff Flake and other Republicans who say look the FBI needs to be able to do its work so this afternoon the FBI was given the the authority by the White House to really talk to anyone at the necessary and that means that they can be looking at\nBrett Kavanaugh was not just his conversations about sexual misconduct and other allegations that he could actually be talking about little live there are some people have pointed out the front Kavanaugh said he had no connections to yell when in fact his grandfather went to jail and he was a legacy student\nYou know it's worth pointing out if you take a step back here this combination was full steam ahead not too long ago and now it's mired in at the very least uncertainty right or maybe some ... blocks in the week ahead what do we know about how\nPresident is watching all of this unfold\nThe president is fuming and he's calling senators everyday basically saying we control the Senate the Republicans control the Senate why in the world can we just push the ... through and essentially the president wants to look at the Republicans and say why can't you do that I mean as a result he's\nReally doing what he's doing watching TV really really boating an angry about the fact that this has been gone through at the end of the day the president has really only certain things he can do he could nominate somebody but he has to wait on the Senate\nWhile the White House is saying they're standing with Brett Kavanaugh there is that list out there of other people and the president said I'm going to look at what the ... and then I'll figure out what happens next\nWe will follow it from here yeah mi ... on the story for us to talk to us thanks\nNow a step back from the politics of this particular FBI probe and a closer look at what might be happening with the investigation outside of the public eye\nFrank Montoya worked in various roles during his twenty five years at the bureau including sense leading the FBI Seattle in Honolulu divisions\nHe joins me today from Salt Lake city ... thank you for being with us I Want to ask you about the scope of what the FBI could be looking into right now to talk to me a little bit about what FBI investigators would be doing and investigation like this right now\nWell first and foremost they'd be talking to as many people as they can I think it was important that the doors were opened a ... earlier this afternoon in terms of what and who they can pursue and in in the pursuit of\nOf information in and keep in mind this is a background investigation not so much a criminal investigation so it's not about\nProving who did what it's more about finding or disapproving or are not finding derogatory information\nSo there'll be talking to a among others are you Deborah ... is\nA doctor for the mark judge a ... some of these others that have been identified publicly as individuals who may have information it could also extend to individuals who are former classmates at Yale who can talk about more than just a potential ... six at a sexual assaults but\nYou know his his drinking habits or his other kinds of behaviors\nOr perhaps when he had drink too much so that there are a lot of people that they can talk to and those people can tell them about others that they can then follow up\nWith you mentioned that word derogatory explained to me the significance of that in terms of what kind of question the FBI investigators are asking when they talk to these people\nAnother great question because again this is about determining if this individual is suitable for the job\nFor which he has been nominated so they're going to look at character they're going to look at a associations are going to look at his reputation\nOf loyalty to the United states not to an individual uh biases or potential biases or ability to do the job and then of course a financial abilities alcohol and drug abuse of potential for alcohol and drug abuse you know when when I was a brand new agent gosh in January of Nineteen Ninety One we learned\nThey taught us that the the acronym to help remember the kinds of things that we're supposed to talk about was Carla beef fat you know and and that was what thirty or twenty seven years ago and I still remember it\nYou know we heard the president earlier asked about this as well whether or not he thought judge Kavanaugh himself should be interviewed does the FBI need to talk to judge Kavanaugh or just a complete this investigation\nAnother great question and whether it's Kavanaugh or is Dr Ford you know there's all kinds of a publicly available testimony that can be reviewed for a potential lead information but again I think this is really about determining whether or not there is more derogatory information out there\nTalking to him about that is not going to get them there talking to folks like Dr Ford or Deborah ... sweating it\nThat's where the rubber meets the road in the background investigation now\nAnother thing that I Would add is that you know if somebody has information and they haven't been spoken to yet that they are by all means freedom to call the FBI or to go to all the local field office and provide that information anything and everything about this matter will be considered and reported\nThe therapeutic effect to increase the number of patients to benefit from this new job after\nJim Alison Nobel Prize winner thank you very much for your [noise]\n\nTurn now to the politics of the mid term elections the debate around judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation raises questions about its potential effect on voters as they get ready to cast their ballot in November these days are done has more\nWe've seen democratic enthusiasm mounting this election season but could we see a rise in Republican motivation amidst the brutal battle over confirming judge Kavanaugh\nWho else could answer those questions better than our own politics Monday panel a fabulous Amy Walter the cook Political Report and I'm Sorry camera case of NPR did you guys in the wrong way to get up I Know I'm a fill in here on this one um\nActually start but can we just take a collective\nDeep breath on behalf of my personal blood pressure and perhaps the nation's psyche before we started talking about judge Kavanaugh and can we start on this topic by looking at their word there was the Quinnipiac poll\nFound of course Americans are split on this but there's some really interesting paradox I think for Americans more Americans believe Christine Blasey Ford but also a near majority believe that there is a smear campaign against judge Kavanaugh\nAmy America is conflicted here what just pulling like that do when we're about to go to an election what does it tell us about voters right I think what\nThat Americans are as polarized on this issue as they are about pretty much any other issue that's put in front of them whether you're a Democrat or Republican your decision\nOn how you feel about this is driven as much by your partisanship than almost anything else that uphold that I saw over the weekend or by the uh the folks at Huffington Post and ...\nFound that again not surprisingly men who supported Donald Trump overwhelmingly said that they could identify with what Brett Kavanaugh was going through women who voted for Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly said that they identified\nWith Christine Blasey Ford but I think fundamentally the question about who does it who's going to help or hurt in the mid term elections right democratic candidates Republican candidates is this about the enthusiasm advantage\nI think we have to remember a couple of things the first is in twenty sixteen\nWe know that the Supreme Court was a big issue for Republican voters and the thinking among a lot of Republicans was this is how Donald Trump won\nA skeptical Republican voters held their nose they didn't really like Trump but they want to the Supreme Court this year all the polling that I've seen thus far since the hearings took place at so at this moment\nWe're seeing increased democratic enthusiasm higher than what a Republican I'm On the issue of the Supreme Court how important the issue is for their vote\nAnd finally I think when all is said and done\nThe issue that drives the selection is still going to be Donald Trump how you feel about Donald Trump is going to be much more important in determining your vote and that how you feel about this hearing\nTown you know Democrats now you heard him he's talking about this earlier are raising more and more questions about\nDid Brett Kavanaugh lie last week and they're raising questions about his drinking habits for example were seen witnesses who support what he says a counter witnesses who say no it was this kind of a drink or not it doesn't change in democratic strategy both on this confirmation and politically\n... there has been a shift in what people are focusing on um it's not clear whether this is a strategic shift or not but certainly there is more focused on whether he was truthful in his testimony and the area\nWhere there's most question about his truthfulness is when it comes to his drinking a Brett Kavanaugh\nOn a number of occasions but sort of Prescott on his drinking and high school and college and it was either a vase of in his answers a sort of downplayed it at times or push back on a couple of senators at times asking them how much they drag 'em and and so President Trump was asked about that today\nTrump a sort of incorrectly said well Brett Kavanaugh on his testimony said that he had a drinking problem and he was younger um which is not what Kavanaugh had said um but uh [noise]\nAnd then he was like in the amount of time that came up yes because it came up frequently the White House ah realizes that this was an issue or they are pushing back they're insisting that Kavanaugh basically admitted to everything except blacking out and uh and\nAnd they're also now pushing out statements from a witnesses from college who say no no no I was his roommate and that other roommate who said something else is wrong\nAmy who does this help in the mid term if if Brett Kavanaugh they get on the Supreme Court Mitch McConnell says it's going to happen this week does that help Republicans in the midterms\nDon't know I mean again\nIt's the conventional wisdom right that they are so fired up\nAbout this not simply because the important so they put on the Supreme Court but because they had to unify together to fight off what they see as a smear campaign by Democrats but then we hear from Democrats and even some Republicans who say but\nWhile it may help Republicans in some of these red states especially in Senate seats and it's really going to hurt Republican candidates in the swing suburban areas where women are already breaking decidedly against Republicans against the president including independent women those are really the key voters here that\nStrategist are looking to at this point to determine where the house goes and I don't think that they're they're going to turn to the side of Republicans on this issue\nAnother factor maybe in where the house goes in the money and we saw Political Report today they did an analysis that they said that Democrats have raised something like thirty five million dollars just in August a loan for their democratic candidates\nTim which is as me does is is that mean more votes for Democrats doesn't mean that they want to put more money what does it mean\nAnd it doesn't mean that there are a lot of Democrats what checkbooks who are very interested in a lot of races all over the country there are also democratic candidates had these incredibly viral ads that they've put out that has gone viral on social media have generated support I mean you hear people I you know because I cover politics I people ask me like what\nDo you think of this race in Kentucky quite what's going on here um there there there is\nA huge amount of interest and there is a huge amount of enthusiasm you see that in the money you see that in the number of people who showed up for about two O'Rourke rally in Texas are you you see the energy and enthused\nBut they also have a lot of energy and they do to just not as much as the Democrats are and at this time\nYeah I mean I'm Talking to consultants on both sides many of them have been doing this for a long time\nAnd they've never seen a this amount of money\nMore important they've never seen an incumbent an incumbent party get outspent the way Democrats are outspending Republicans in these congressional races I mean it's it's um it's mind boggling number and this is why when we talk about why the house and play the houses in play because\nThe amount of enthusiasm that Democrats have is translating and all these different ways it ... it turned into one enthusiasm for democratic voters\nCandidates who said I'm going to run for office including a bunch of people who'd never run for office before and now the money what it's done is it's taken a playing field that was really narrow and it was structurally very challenging for Democrats because we're only twenty five thirty seats\nIn play and it expanded that universe and now we have a universe right now about sixty Republican seats that are in danger that\nIs why we're that's when enthusiasm not my spreadsheet cannot handle any more race there okay [laughter] someone that you know I'm All right let me ask about for us political long because I think would be a fun question I feel like the universe has been dominated by just a handful of stores but let me asking what political stories are we're not talking about that we should be a town\nWon a temporary budget passed as spending measure and there wasn't a massive fight nothing crazy happened it just pass the president signed it no drama no drama which is why I made it there was no drama also this is a small thing but there's only been one there was in the month of September there was only one televised White House press briefing\nDaily White House press briefing only happened on one day and the entire month of September\nBriefly Amy I'm I Do think this money is it absolutely going to be the story of the twentieth and campaign the question for Democrats is can they replicate this when it's no longer just simply about ousting Donald Trump or his party in the mid term election\nAnd when they might have one candidate twenty thank you very much
