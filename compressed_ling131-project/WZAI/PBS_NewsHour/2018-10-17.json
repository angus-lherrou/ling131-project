are areas where the United states and Saudi Arabia of cooperating\nIn fifties the Nineteen sixties what we did together in Afghanistan in the Nineteen eighties ah so this is a long standing relationship\nBeyond that of course you have the specific goals and objectives of the Trump Administration has identified\nFor its own policies in the middle east and there are basically three areas where the administration has indicated that they want to make progress\nOne of course is the confrontation with violent extremist organizations particularly in Syria and Iraq but also Yemen and a more widely second of course as a confrontation with Iran and the desire of the Trump Administration to push back\nOn Iran's regional ambitions a it's a ballistic missile programs and the other aspects

very much to both [noise]\nThree weeks from today voters will head to the polls for the ... election that briefing\nKey races has many wondering if they're still able to cast their ballots to take a closer look at where voting rights stand right now I'm joined by Carol Anderson professor of African American studies at Emory University in Atlanta Georgia\nShe's the author of the book one person no vote how voter suppression is destroying our democracy\nProfessor Anderson welcome to the news hour I Want to begin by asking you about some more recent conversations around voter suppression they tend to look back just a few years at a twenty Thirteen Supreme Court decision that decision to roll back some of the protection of the historic Nineteen sixty five voting rights act\nWhat's your take on how significant that move was\nOh the gutting of the voting rights act in the Shelby County beholder decision of twenty Thirteen was significant we had already had\nUm the the the slowing of the seeds of the erosion I'm beginning and the two thousand election where you had the language of voter fraud really coming to the fore there and then being embedded in federal law with the help America vote act um although voting fraud which had been debunked\n'em by the time that that had happened but by the time we get to the twenty Thirteen election the ground had really been sewn for this and it in fact I'm just let all of the kinds of\nOf voting rights abuses are run loose um we see that in many of the states that have been cleared\nHad previously been under pre clearance from the department of justice and we also see that in states that hadn't been pre cleared but had taken on the mantle of stopping um suppose that voter fraud\nWhen you say pre clearance I Want to clarify for audience these were states that had a history of discriminatory practices when it came to voting statutes they no longer had to get federal approval to change those rules but when you say significant who did it affect um what population how many people\nAnd so where you see the the effects really um come come from what I call the Obama coalition I'm In the two thousand eight election um you had um\nHe brought with his incredible ground game Fifteen million new voters to the polls overwhelmingly African American Latino Asian American young and poor when we began to look at these voter suppression laws that the group that are targeted um that is the group where issues\nDoes a closing voter I'm I'm voting polls um issues such as voter roll purchase all of those begin to take into account and hit each one of those groups sometimes simultaneously sometimes one more than the others but that's where we're seeing in and we're seeing it in terms of\nA for instance in Wisconsin\nI'm with the voter id law um after the twenty sixteen election of study was done and it was found that eight percent of whites were stopped from voting by the voter id law the twenty seven percent of African Americans were stopped\nUm we're seeing with voter roll 'em purges in Ohio for instance where two million have been purged off of the rules so far but uh in one of those major purchased twenty five percent came\nPrimarily solely out of Cuyahoga County which is Cleveland which it has a sizable African American population\nProfessor and you mentioned the voter ID laws a voter role changes as well a lot of people who are putting those steps into place at the state and local level say these are necessary to protect the integrity of our elections chicken you should make sure that they are fair so why wouldn't we want our voter rolls updated why wouldn't we want people to have to show and I do when they vote\nAnd that's one of the great ways the way voter suppression works is that it sounds reasonable until you see how it's operational life and when you also understand for instance that the issue of voter id is based on the lie of voter fraud and what I mean by that\nIs that Justin Levitt a professor out of California did a study and from two thousand to two thousand and fourteen\nHe counted up all of the votes in all of the elections and came to one billion votes\nOut of that he identified thirty one cases of voter fraud\nThirty one cases out of one billion vote that's hardly the massive rampant voter fraud that we consistently hear as needing to have all of this protection via voter id but based on that lie of voter fraud\nUm and and I said that lie because even when the proponents of voter fraud or really call to to bring out the evidence of it such as Kris Kobach out of Kansas are Gregory Abbott out of Texas they cannot identify\nMassive rampant voter fraud at best Greg Abbott was able to come up with two cases in all of Texas and so\nProtecting the integrity of the ballot box\n... is not under siege by voter fraud and so what we get then is that kind of sounding reasonable with we need voter id but for what\nIn the way that the voter ideas are crafted is like North Carolina\nLooked at the data by race on the kinds of ideas of African Americans had and didn't have and then crafted the law to go for the ones that African Americans did not have\n'em and and that is what we're seeing in Alabama for instance Alabama's Jim needed to have a government issued photo ID\nProfessor edited and I'm hearing you say this is a problem around the country then because often we talked about it like it's in this house but you've named a number of states their way your studies have shown that occurs and block to leave it there for now professor

presidents apart who made the decision wisely how much difference does that Eric\nCantor is exactly what singles out the best of war presidents Abraham Lincoln for instance when there were so many Americans being killed from the north ordered a cemetery built near his summer house to make sure that he he would see the coffins being lowered into graves\nIt it was painful to him but he didn't want to be separated from the consequences of these terrible decisions he was making\n[noise] you make news with a number of a result of this incredible research you've done over time Michael but and one of those disclosures that's gotten attention most recently is that it is is letting us know that Lyndon Johnson prevented nuclear weapons\nFrom being placed in Vietnam we didn't know about this before your\nWife or I never thought I'd get a Sunday New York times page one story you know writing Minnesota history book\nBut LBJ in Nineteen sixty eight had been asked by his commander in Vietnam William west\nNuclear weapons in the south Vietnam for possible use in case the Americans lost a battle and Johnson who had made some terribly mistaken decisions as Vietnam to as a turtle credits said not at all shut down the planning take those documents put them in a safe\nAnd they were in a safe for about a half century which is how I got some of them\nYou know for the first time able to write about them later on Lyndon Johnson's great deed and Vietnam that we really didn't know about he kept that war from possibly going nuclear could've involve Russia and China could have involved the fate of the earth over this civil war in Vietnam\n[noise] one of the most memorable observations you make you write about it the first of the book and at the end as you said if the founding fathers came back today what would they think they would be thunder struck to discover\nLife or death of most of the human race has come to depend on the character of the one person it occupies the American president say ...\nAnd that's true that's the choice we make you know the president of the United states can make a decision about firing nuclear weapons that conceivably could kill a majority of the people on earth that's the kind of power that's gone to one individual\nThe founders were terrified of something like that they wrote ... they tried to write a constitution that would not depend on the president being someone of great judgment in character because as you remember they all felt but not all human beings Rangel's\nWhat are the qualities Americans look for in a president who's gonna if there is a decision to go to war if it's the it's a decision that's been carefully thought through and it's truly and the best interest of the American people\nYou have to make sure that if a president asks us for war and the president will yet again hopefully not soon it has to be for something that's absolutely essential for our national interest the American people have to support it United and they're kept the any lives told about the cause\nAnd finally I have to ask this since the United states hasn't been seen as winning a war since World War two what does that say about either the American character American leadership in American military did you draw any conclusions about that\nAmerican military American Soldiers or first grade they're courageous you know we we've seen
