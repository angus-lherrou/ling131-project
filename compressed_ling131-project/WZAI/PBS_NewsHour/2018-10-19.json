significant economic growth John Yang takes a look behind the data\nOn though the government reported it just ended the fiscal year with the deficit of seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars that's a Seventeen percent jump from twenty Seventeen\nRemembers getting close scrutiny because most of President Trump's one point five trillion dollar tax code took effect in January just three months into the spending you're\nHere to walk us through all this the ... always correspond at least ... and David Wessel director of the Hutchins Center on fiscal and monetary policy at the Brookings Institution\nWe want to start with you how does this number for twenty two twenty three fiscal year how does that fit into historical trends\nThis is a dramatic increase in recent years let's look at some numbers you go back just three years ago twenty Fifteen the number of the deficit that year was four hundred and thirty nine billion dollars look at that this is almost double what it was then\nAnd it's going to continue to rise John many people now looking just two years it's going to be right around one trillion dollars according to congressional budget office and that courage John continue to get even steeper as we continue to go forward\nNow what's interesting here is this still is not as high as the deficits were in two thousand nine and two dozen ten is for historic highs and relatively recent terms\nHowever those were yours and which we had a recession we're talking about these deficits now in times of growth and a good economy and that is different\nAnd of course those projections juries court last season to start if nothing would have changed now what's driving the twenty team deposition\nThat's right so if you look deep into the numbers of the Treasury Department put out you find some very interesting things first of all in this year talking about taxes we look at these numbers you see that actual tax revenue stayed about flat it rose about half a percent a little bit less\nBut spending is what has changed most dramatically and you've got flat revenues and you've got a lot more spending\nLess about not money coming in a lot of money going out you get a deficit\nWhere was the biggest wherever the bigger increases defense spending sixty five billion dollar increase just in the past year and look at that interest on the debt we thought increase of sixty two billion dollars in what we're spending to pay off this debt now of course defense isn't the only places San increased but that's\nFor spent a lot more and we have a larger deficit\nSo David the or at least it says that the ... the revenues remaining flat so what does that tell us about the effect of President Trump's tax cuts well\nThe economy as we said is very strong and so without a tax cut we would have seen increasing revenues we also see if you look at the numbers corporate tax receipts fell thirty percent\nAnd that's largely the result of the president's tax cuts so what we're seeing you would expect at a time like this revenues rising faster than spending because the economy strong more people working paying taxes fewer people collecting unemployment benefits and such and the deficit which Rick we see the opposite and that's largely because of the tax cut\nNow David senator majority leader Mitch McConnell says it's entitlements you said Social Security Medicare Medicaid that's what's driving these deficit forecast is he right well look\nIf you look at what happened last year it's not Social Security Medicare and Medicaid its taxes the size of the tax cut a was about ... according to see the I was about a hundred and sixty five billion dollars the deficit increased by a hundred and Thirteen million dollars do the arithmetic\nIf you look ahead though a and you look at the projections the reason the deficit is rising is because we are spending more on Social Security Medicare and Medicaid largely because the population is aging if you look at CBS ten year projections\nPrograms like food stamps housing assistance like housing section eight vouchers it also includes the low income subsidy for Medicare part D\nAnd that includes Medicaid burning below a hundred and twenty five percent of the poverty line and failing to work if authorized to do so\nThe Trump Administration is sending a message to people to the world that the United states is only open for wealthy people\nOr at least wealthy enough says Francis says no federal\nLaw journal requires it before national succumbed to come to remain in the United states be able to support themselves from actually might be dependent on the public can be thirty\nSo is the administration simply looking out for us taxpayers well according to a report from the national Academy of sciences federal taxpayers are already coming out ahead UC Davis economist Giovanni Perry\nOlder we said as soon as show that you met the immigrants are is fiscal surplus of loss for the U.S meaning what meaning that they pay more taxes into the system that they receive but in terms of all the public spending whether in benefits\nOf course the more educated and highly skilled at the immigrant like professor Perry himself I ever saw them in front of the larger the fiscal surplus\nAnd immigrants can be a drain on state and local budgets primarily due to the cost of educating their kids but when it comes to federal budgeting\nCompare favorably to similar native born Americans because they're less likely to be eligible for benefits and more likely to work\nSo if the lord you guys are going to get on to work at ready to Seventy Seventy five percent versus lord you're good to meet people that work at a rate of fifty fifty five percent but also because the stigma in applying for welfare because they've come here to work to support to be a feminist\nEnded immigrants were reluctant to apply for benefits before the rule change they're terrified\nNow you have a baby girl now this is someone so did you think about enrolling in wick again\nAt the beginning they have a little meal I couldn't but if you hit so they thought the told me they will be late if I get weak because they wouldn't be provided me with formula\nBut with this faith we didn't want to try because who's going to be at the list for my when I say\nEven though which is not even targeted and the proposed rules\nSince they live in a changing and these unity of gave me an exit is now the gate I don't really say if they can for them in more\nThan one of ... her fear seems reasonable even before the Trump Administration officially propose to the rule change this month multiple involving drafts of it had leaked and were widely covered by foreign language media the rule is so\nMassive and confusing that it's gonna make people fearful across the country\nSherry here Rhoda is CEOs Asian health services at bay area network\nClinics we have patients that have asked to be taken off of uh our electronic health records we have people who are afraid to sign up for food stamps legal immigrants are now at the cross hairs\nThis is about people who are legally entitled to these benefit programs but now are being told if you use them you will be denied a green card\nMillions of immigrants received benefits targeted by the rules so some like refugees are exempted they may choose to forego aid anyway it's happened before\nThe closest analog we have to what might happen\nFrom this proposed rule is what happened after the welfare reform of the Nineteen nineties with changes in immigrant eligibility for many elements of the social safety net\nUC Berkeley economist Hillary Hawaiian ... says the chilling effect for large you'd misinformation and fear\nSo a policy change food stamps that we see people\nSo that's dimension one dimensional too is that there are groups who are unaffected by the policy change for example citizen children who nonetheless dropped out of participation in programs that were affected\nBut what's the big deal if you were immigrants or their families claim benefits for one thing says Asian health services Dr Kimberly Chang if immigrants are afraid to get health care that could pose a public health risk\nIf you think about infectious disease if you think about the flu season that's coming up if you think about measles if people don't come in and get those vaccines they put the American population at risk\nMore broadly pushing immigrants off benefits might save taxpayers money in the short run but it could cost money in the long run\nThose to to get more access to Medicaid or food stamps cut fire earnings and are more economically self sufficient in adulthood and so there were socially come into the labor market as more productive workers are generating more taxes and generating more income for their families in adulthood\nAll of these different programs are anti poverty programs for a reason they're actually helping people make ends meet when times are hard my own personal story is that I'm the youngest of ten we immigrated from Columbia in the Nineteen seventies we use food stamps when my father and my mother were in between jobs when they were laid off from their factory jobs and\nToday my nine brothers and sisters and I are all professional\nMeanwhile even though no one in her family received any benefits now Maria is still at risk of losing her right to stay here because as a new mom she's not currently working plus her American husband low income levels might raise red flags who is going to raise my kids to it\nCuts the thing what are you going to do with Maria can't get a permanent\nGreen card would go with her for us we would be immigrants and look for do some irony to the editor\nFor the PBS NewsHour I'm Catherine Rampell reporting from California [noise]\nTroubling questions about the life and football career of the former New England patriots start Aaron Hernandez and what those questions say about the game itself Hernandez was an all American at the University of Florida who became a dominating tight end for the patriots he played for too\nFlorida and build ballot check in New England ...\nHernandez had a history of incivility and volatility and later became criminally violets he was convicted if the twenty Thirteen murder of old and a lawyer mandating his fiance sister\nAnd he was linked to other violent cases including a twenty twelve double homicide in which he was acquitted last year Hernandez killed himself in jail his spectacular rise and dramatic fall is now the subject of a major investigation by the Boston Globe spotlight team uncovering new details about his trouble childhood\nBrain damage and the number of warning signs missed or ignored by teammates friends and coaches over the years\nBob holder is one of the lead reporters and joins me now Bob thank you for making the time congratulations on an incredible series I Know the last one actually comes out tonight but let me ask you a spotlight team as the storied franchise\nWhat was it about the story of Aaron Hernandez that led you to want to turn all your time and energy and resources towards his story\nThis was a huge story on the broken our very own backyard here on our turf\nAnd we thought there was so mounted on answered questions about every aspect of his life we wanted to do and we wanted to know was was he doesn't know lawyer or is this something that we can learn some lessons from a and sort of a broader sense and what was the role of the tea either go to the terrible bringing during the football players suffer how does that affect his life\nSo millions of Americans came to know Aaron Hernandez in his public life right as a very talented football star as a charismatic handsome young man you and your team wrote and want to hear reports so uh that that public persona quote proved to be much less important than what he had kept\nHidden so what was it that he kept hidden what did you uncover particularly about his early life\nWill he lived but he lived a double life and you know after he died there was a myth that rose that ah that that his father died when he was sixteen and the myth was that\nHe suddenly fell apart but it was you come up in his Ozzie and Harriet life and then suddenly everything what went wrong in his life in fact his father brutally beat him as a child brutally beat him as a child was sexually molested as a child\nAnd by the time he was in middle school he was exploring his sexuality and or was involved with boards which would have been an incredible uh offense to his father who was extremely hope of homophobic according to his brother score to his brother and so he was living this double secret life even as a child in the church through with him and to a high school and college later\nIs kind of came together to um reveal sort of troubling behavior over the years a pattern really when you look back on it now and yet still this was a young man who was basically fast tracked through high school through college into the pros how does that happen well it's a big\nBusiness the football this is football nc and these guys are commodities there and if they're good they're very valuable at the University of Florida where he went up there at the age of Seventeen they pulled him out of high school six months early they wanted them so badly they got 'em down there and the naval to him he was as you said and run ins with the law down there\nNo serious consequences on he went he defeated beautifully for them they want a national championship great player and they send them off to the NFL with all kinds of problems including marijuana heavy chronic marijuana use that are that they were aware of", "year":
