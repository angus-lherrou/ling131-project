the market tonight for a new ambassador to the United nations Nikki Haley will formally resigned at the end of the year after two years in the post or foreign affairs correspondent next Schaeffer begins our coverage\nIn the oval office today President Trump and an bathroom Nikki Haley exchanged mutual praise\nYou been fantastic you might trade and I just on behalf of the country I Want to do the regular now the United states has written back their country's may not like\nWe do what they that's what we do they know that if we say we're going to do something we follow through and the president for that\nAnd outside the White House more facts from secretary of state Mike Pompeo\n... been a great partner by for that now\nFive months that she had I had no working together uh and I want to wish your very well\nFrom the beginning Haley was well respected by many un diplomats well covered by the media and embrace President Trump's foreign policy and combative for those that don't have our backward taking names [noise] she trumpeted the U.S embassy moved to Jerusalem\nAnd the U.S any education and humanitarian support for Palestinians and when a hundred and twenty eight countries voted their disapproval she once again warned she was taking names\nUnited States will remember this day in which it was singled out first\nOn the wrong she reflected Trump policy when she spoke in front of Iranian weapons that she said proves Iran sends missiles to regional allies\nIt's hard to find a conflict or terrorist group in the middle East that does not have Iran's fingerprints all over it\nFinally got the mouse suffering in Boston\nAnd on Russia She criticized Moscow support for Syrian president Bashar al Assad especially after an April twenty Seventeen chemical weapons attack\nHow many more children have to die before Russia cares\nThat's where she reflected the foreign policy establishment antipathy to Russia over President Trump's positive rhetoric allied officials describe her as a kind of translator to President Trump's isolationism they sought her out and defense secretary James Mattis who today said she did quote humans work\nWe have a very close working relationship uh we're ... and many occasions collaborating together on how we would deal with certain issues\nThat collaboration started when former secretary of state rex Tillerson's ineffectiveness allowed her to become a high profile voice of Trump's foreign policy\nBut then Tillerson was fired and she didn't get the job for ... did and John Bolton became national security advisor her wings were caught that's when she says she first told the president she wanted to resign and when she got out over ... announcing rushing sanctions that never came\nYou will see that rushed in a sanctions will be coming down\nBut that announcement never came and top economic adviser Larry Kudlow called Haley confused she shot back she doesn't get confused despite that dust up as she had for the last few years Haley remain in the president's good graces even though in twenty sixteen she campaign for one of his main rivals Florida Senator Marco Rubio\nWe need to show that South Carolina makes presidents and then our next president won't be\nPresident Trump's criticism of her was always tempered Nikki Haley averting a woman she said I'm an angry person and they said to me they said you were an angry person I thought I said I Am I'm very angry because I hate what's happening to our country I Am\nHaley assumed an conveyed that anger at the un White House officials describe her as overly political but on policy she reflected the president's style and substance for the PBS NewsHour a mixture\nAnd joining me now is our White House correspondent\nMany people are asking why is Nikki Haley doing this now she said personal reasons term limits a book what else do we know about what's happening here\nWhat we know is that Washington was really really shocked when Nikki Haley made this announcement and it's because our news our news our producers here study the list of the last Thirty years of you and ambassadors and an almost every single case when that\nPerson resigned in the middle of a president's term it's because they were taking another job and then ... that is not the case with Nikki Haley I spoke with someone\nWho's close to Nikki Haley who was who also helped get our elected in South Carolina that person said she's very politically ambitious and a good way and that she would no one to leave and in this case she leaving when the administration's having a good couple of weeks they had Brett Kavanaugh confirmed the trade deal went through\nYou also have the the economy doing well so Nikki Haley as kind of leaving on his high there is of course this idea that you could look running twenty twenty with Nikki Haley was very from today she said she's not running and twenty twenty and she's actually going to help President Trump\nCampaign so she's throwing her support behind the president um but that's pretty much where people are talking about today well we heard\nA in next report that the president was complimenting her today she was complimenting him how it is her leaving compared to the departure of other high level a Trump Administration officials there have been a few and what do we know about who might take her place\nWell Nikki Haley's announcement is very abnormal because it was so normal there's this idea that in the Trump Administration when people have left it's usually been because of scandal and they've been fired via Twitter just a couple of list there's everyone has invited on Twitter\nUm are some of the people are the secretary of state Rex Tillerson\nSecretary of veteran affairs David Shulkin then you have former FBI Director James Comey who was fired as he was speaking the FBI agent there was then there was the whole scene of the motorcade being followed by a new shopper because everyone was so shocked then you have scandals the secretary of health and Human Services Tom Price\nAnd the EPA administration that's environmental protection agency\nThey were both the fire to resign because of ethical concerns um all that being said the president said there are many many names among people who could be people that would that would replace Nikki Haley he's floating the idea floated the idea of avant garde Trump even though she tweeted very quickly I Am not going to be the next\nUN ambassador there's also Dina ... she's the former White House and deputy of national security she's someone who is very well regarded but really we're going to have to wait and see Judy\nAs they take up cases later that may be a highly divisive or are they going to be able to reach a certain consensus so that they don't always divide five for in a way that it's five Republican appointed justices and for democratic appointed justices\nWe also had as we said we heard about new new justice Kavanaugh's comments last night as we heard he singled out the senators some of the senators who voted for him who fought for his his confirmation ah and then last week he talked about Democrats being motivated by revenge yeah are his words can\nDon't think they can uh I think when he wrote an op ed piece in the wall Street Journal before he was confirmed he did attempt to walk back\nSome of the intense part is in language that he used at his last hearing before the Judiciary Committee\nUp but that could almost be perceived by some people as an effort to lobby for votes for his confirmation so it was I think almost incumbent on him after his confirmation and since he was in the public ceremony last night to say something to reassure\nThose who did view the that op ed pieces as not a genuine expression of regret that he will be a neutral open minded justice\nSo let's talk about today what were the first day there you were telling us the large crowd of people who wanted to get into the yeah or what was it like well\nIt was almost like a normal day except for the fact that there was a new face on the bench and justice cabin on now sits at the extreme right and the bench as you face it in his uh right next to him is Justice Kagan who had actually wasn't Obama appointed justice\nUh it it was a normal day he asked I counted about eight questions during two hours of argument in two cases and his delivery was very ah professional straightforward\nMuch as he's been described when he sat on the appellate court and right before the argument I he actually seem happy to be there he was chatting and laughing with a Justice Kagan\nHis family his wife and two daughters were sitting in special seats that are for guests of the justices a ... a Justice Kennedy who had sworn him in a second time last night at the White House also attended\nWhat about marshal the cases that are coming up expected to come up this this term for the court are they the kinds of cases where we maybe can look for some momentous precedent and breaking a decisions on the part of the court\nSo right now the docket is very low key in terms of the cases that they've agreed to hear and decide but that could actually change next week in fact it could even change this week uh\nIn the wings right now are cases involving whether our national ... a job anti discrimination law\nProtects against sexual orientation discrimination there are two cases involving Medicaid funding cut off by states\nOthers a case involving a World War one memorial cross on public land which also these are all flash point kinds of cases and just today it looks as though\nThe a case involving whether there's to be a citizenship question on the census is coming to the court very quickly so yes there they're going to be many challenges I think down the road there's so much more in the pipeline to the court involving the Trump Administration that really will test the court\nUh in terms of whether they can find consensus in and not appear partisan\nThis new court just getting underway with a knife justice sitting there and are shifting time Marcia Coyle watching it all yes for sure interesting thank you my pleasure and Judy [noise]\nFour weeks from tonight the news hour political team will join me here at this desk to cover the mid term elections well we'll find out which party controls the U.S house of representatives and the Senate for the next few years\nOne of the most closely watched races is in North Dakota which many Republicans think hold their best shot at taking over a set up said now held by a Democrat\nI travel there this past weekend for a close up look\n[noise]\nThe place to be this Sunday in southeastern North Dakota was the annual ... festival tiny rotten one celebrating its Scandinavian Ruth skiing on grass a kid trying to raise\nAnd the highlight of Hillary attractive young and old and the two candidates in one of the most competitive races for a U.S Senate seat this fall\nDon't you notice all the Norwegian flags but Norwegians dollar\nDemocrat Heidi Heitkamp and only high level member of her party left in a state that for years sent mostly Democrats to Washington is in the bull's eye of a Republican drive to hang onto its majority in the U.S Senate and as a bonus sweeps Democrats out of power here\nWe're just couldn't keep up with where north Florida was going and so like maybe the last you know\nTaking her on his Republican Kevin Cramer North Dakota's only member of the U.S house and an enthusiastic backer of president\nTrump didn't say Mr President thank you for not forgetting one here by\nOnly two states in the country have a smaller\nAnd it's fair to say most Americans are familiar with the name of its major city only because of a movie\nEven so it is this state that is poised to be the biggest determinant this fall and whether Democrats have a chance of retaking control of the U.S Senate\nHike camp like other red state Democrats up for reelection this year often reminds voters of her independence how much she works across party lines\nThere are too many people who only vote on one side one hundred percent of the time and that'll never be mean\nIn her case she's not only voted with President Trump more than half the time she was one of a tiny number of Democrats mentioned for a job and his administration\nBut when the Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court came up she voted against a move short of please her base voters\nThis is an issue of conscience this is an issue of judicial temperament and taking this hyper partisan executive branch the hyper partisan legislative branch let's make apart is important I think that is absolutely the wrong direction\nShe was concerned enough about how her vote would go over that she caught up paid ad about it first job\nHonestly I don't think he told the truth and even if he did he showed himself to be too biased to be impartial\nAs a house member Kramer didn't have a vote but which for cabin off from the start if you had to clarify his views after he told a reporter that nothing happened to blog before\nYou know I don't do the premise that it really didn't have enough I think the allegations that they were true Rob recently serious clearly here's something very till now the top and er I don't know what it is\nTo women voters we spoke to in Fargo this weekend told us their view is closer to Kramer's\nThe time [noise]\nMotives there have a hard time with something that happened so long ago\nMade mistakes in the past but one person in a crowded Sundays festivities in rutland said Heitkamp handled it just right to be more but\nSo did Vanessa ... whom we met at her family's farm near cold facts\nIt probably strengthens my ideal of what Heidi's stands for because whether he was guilty or not\nAnd very partisan so the truck coming down the driveway Fran\nRight here in my hair ... Kumar hasn't even stronger reason to support high camp opposition to President Trump's get tough trade policy toward China\nWhich China responded to by ending its purchase of us soybeans one of North Dakota's main farm exports the result has been drastic losses for soybean farmers here\nWell it's basically been shut down for us\n... is one of tens of thousands of soybean farmers in North Dakota we're feeling the effects of the trade war with China\nThe combine will come across and\nUh-huh Sarah love us and her husband oversee eight thousand acres in Hillsboro half of which are soybeans\nWere really feeling the effects here in North Dakota savings has become a very big crop for us here\nIn in this geography and on our own farm China\nMajor customer of ours we miss having the opportunity to sell her being to them they've been great customers over the years go over there to\nLove us estimate their losses alone could run to almost two hundred thousand dollars this year meaning they can't grow their business as they planned\nWe were actually thinking about getting another\nCombine earlier this year so so I've been ... plumbing and and may and June and we did not do that\nReimbursement um which is more\nWas actually my son was paid for by the states as long as it's a\n... student loan debt she\nToo early to qualify for tax credits to help sponsor and she cannot take advantage of the program so how long did it take you to\nGet on that or you know I still have four thousand nine hundred and eighty two dollars left [laughter] not that I got this morning\nIn Maine for the PBS NewsHour Marist ring of Austin [noise]\nUnited States has now been fighting in Afghanistan for Seventeen years for that entire time Dr Abdullah Abdullah has sat at the forefront of Afghan politics he twice ran for president in fraud riddled elections and twice last after a bitter post election fight in twenty fourteen with\nEssential winter Ashraf Ghani Abdel assigned a power sharing agreement and

it's meant to be independent theaters in ... this is the fact that the security is the is the challenge and it it absorbs most of the sources of energy and the time about a year ago President Trump announced new south Asia strategy\nMy original instinct was to pull out and historically I like following my instincts\nPresident Trump has expressed skepticism about keeping troops in Afghanistan do you think the strategy is sustainable\nTo make it work is of course part of it this far less inside the country as we thought at these as well as the citizens of that country or in parts of it is the cooperation from the region which shit uh distracting she has a regional aspect and\nThey and other parts of it is dealing with the centuries so you just use the word sanctuary or your friend the Pakistan a yes or that to a part of the the issue a remains to be steady and in a different challenge\nThe U.S has spent seven hundred and fifty billion dollars on security in Afghanistan in a hundred and twenty five million on reconstruction those of us who live in Afghanistan though that it's\nNot about the money but it has been Seventeen years why do you believe that this strategy can succeed where the last Seventeen years the strategy hasn't produced results that were promised\nDetection engagement day not a close run detracts\nThat announcement of a withdraw into those into ... which can

his shoulders I used to\nAnd what about commitment from\nSenior off guns to the United states there have been some prominent political figures and parliamentarians recently as you know who question the utility the bilateral security agreement between Afghanistan and the United states does that signal and erosion of trust in NATO and the United states on the outcomes that\nI Would say that to consider that as part of the freedom of speech\nOr the uh did was a meeting there does it get to get as far out of the book was in some political leaders I Wish I did on which had developed dead on an

hardest on should continue military security what [noise] uh and to outside the front of some sort of this you're cheap they should feel pressure\nThere used to be a lot more pressure on them because we used to be a hundred thousand us troops so why would they come to the table and speak directly due Afghan government which is what the us is asking for when they wouldn't in the past now\nAbout to

of the world that could be a complete this June ... and to get [noise]\n\nOn our bookshelf tonight presidential historian and author Doris Kearns Goodwin on leadership in turbulent times I sat down with a recently and again our conversation by asking how she came up with the idea for this for eight book\nWhen I began at five years ago there was a feeling that Washington was broken that bipartisanship had been lost and I decided I wanted to look back\nAt other presidents my guys a special I call them that because I've lived with them for so long when they had gotten to more challenging times even than ours and yet somehow were able to pull the citizens and the leaders bond together to make the country better and then it got even more turbulent as time went on\nOne of the first things I noticed when I look at the book on the back cover you have a positive comments they call them blurbs from\nWarren Buffett and Jim Collins who's known for the book and good to great these are business people or does that tell us this is a different kind of history book\nOne point I was speaking to a lot of business groups over these last couple of decades but also to colleges and universities and the kids raised his hand and said how can I ever become one of these guys\nThem so I thought what if I write about them when they first start to run for office when they're twenty three and twenty five and twenty eight\nAnd when there's still an formed in when they're gonna make mistakes and when they're going to screw up things then maybe young people can aspire to be leaders I Would just love it if more people in this country went into public life went into leadership positions because that's what we need right now\nAnd of course before you choose to focus on is Abraham Lincoln Teddy Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson used the term screwing up and you do focus in the book on the problems they face early in their lives why was that important\nPeople
