agency and the president met his tradition to de emphasize the protection of children's health\nOften in a bureaucracy when some executive is put on administrative leave it to signal that they're

see in the ... the deadly wall of water was generated by seven points ... magnitude earthquake offshore Indonesian government installed a system of twenty two boys to help detect pressure changes\nThey haven't been functional in years and the new system to be anchored to the ocean floor and less vulnerable to vandalism was awaiting the green light for deployment when it was rejected for lack of funding just days before the most recent disaster struck\nUniversity of Pittsburgh political science professor Luis comfort worked with teams of researchers in the U.S and and then they show to develop an undersea sensor network to detect Saddam he's professor comfort joins us now welcome to living on her\nThank you for having me\nSo what are the challenges in Asia has faced in preparing for extreme events like Saddam is\nIndonesia is in a very risk prone environment Seventeen thousand islands and counting it has a major earthquake over seven point\nMagnitude on the Richter scale every year at least every year it's vulnerable also to sue nominees and volcanic eruptions so this is a major challenge for the country\nAnd of course a what a little more than a decade ago there was a huge catastrophic phenomenal event there in Indonesia\nYes two thousand for a sit down I mean at the tip of northern Sumatra bond to ... and ... literally one in three people in that city were killed I was there\nTwo and a half months after the tsunami that seeing the devastation and still it was the stench of dead bodies two and a half months it's just\nSobering and it's this kind of experience that has made me so intent on trying to do what is possible to support decision making for the public managers that face these horrifying situations\nSo I understand that the proposal to get these sensors installed in western Sinatra stalled in fact just a few days before this latest sue nominee hit a I guess it was due to funding concerned how did you react when you heard the news\nI was profoundly disappointed profoundly disappointed\nThere were two parts to this project what is he under seen yet where that provides the initial\nNear real time warning and then the second is the network of electronic devices essentially a cell phones handheld cell phones that enable people in the community to communicate as they evacuate or move to\nYou do the deployment this fall September October the Indonesian agency the M. K. gee was very interested in this proposal you know unfortunately the project is currently on hold until more funding comes in\nSo it's like that everybody agree that people should wear seatbelts but that wasn't enough money for everyone to have one unfortunately that's exactly the case as I understand that there was a system of bullies there to warn people about Saddam is what happened to them\nThat's one of the painful parts of this project um Indonesia\nSupported by the U.S in Germany had twenty two movies that were operating and designed actually to provide\nA similar data from the ocean floor change in the water pressure in the water column but those buoys actually had been vandalized and we're not functioning\nAnd as a matter of fact the Marines survey agency BP T that managed the movies actually cancelled that program because they were not able to keep them operational so the boys had not been operating since two thousand sixteen\nNow what are the advantages of the system that you helped to develop over the now defunct system of bullies\nThe major difference is it is anchored to the ocean floor so it cannot be vandalized and it uses a very interesting scientific phenomenon\nOf the thermal kind of warm equatorial waters to enable a crusty communication that is underwater communication where the data is transmitted from the sensors to another communication center\nTo another communication sensor and then picked up and transmitted via cable to land station that transmits the data via satellite\nAnd of course the coast of communication in the water is what the wells students are\nExactly that's exactly right\nTo what extent has perspective now the in the nation government changed given this recent disaster\nWell I Hope it has changed right now I'm certain that they're full attention is on the immediate recovery but you know I Do hope that the agencies will reconsider is as a a very important part of their overall\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support WBAI at Cape and islands dot org\n... while\nBarring archipelago Norway as the rug good frozen landscape near the Arctic Circle that's home to polar bears reindeer and walrus as living on earth explorer in residence marks a lender explains he recently had an up close maybe to close for comfort encounter with a three thousand pound walrus\nA finger of glacial till points in the fjord unsolved barred that ... ten point whether walrus haul out the place is low but the slowly steep for a walrus and once the effort is made the herd prefers to stay there\nDo not disturbed that is all they want\nA droughts and stretch of slippery like an open hand reaches into the air is just making shadows on or non existent wall scratches the chin to cheat\nThan let's hand fall the walruses\nAnd there are tens and bounds or blending into the lead the way they climb\nOut in the frigid water\nAnd the bulk of him a measure of his station\nHe paddles on concerned towards ...\nThis is P.

Massachusetts which gave him a lifetime attachment to the sea over the decades he's played key roles in legislation an international negotiations on climate change acid rain an ocean health\nSecretary Kerry welcome to living on her happy to be here thank you so you know if there's one thing from your book every day is extra it is your love of the OSHA why does the ocean called in such a strong way\nWhile I'm a set of Massachusetts I think it costs to all of us sons and daughters we are a\nBlessed to be people at the sea here in the state of Massachusetts and we love Cape Cod we love the islands\nAnd I learned as a kid you know I was raised out on the ... bay and I used to just clam and fish and play in the water learn how to sail do all these wonderful things but I learned about under the water and I was a big Philippe Cousteau fan\nAnd just the two and my mother was an enormous conservationist environmentalist and I grew up with a sense of responsibility understanding that the ocean is fragile it's not impervious to the things we humans do it\nAnd as as I recall from your book and you're fortunate childhood you were on when I Lived with islands you on the ... yeah you come out of Woods Hole and you can see it on your way to Martha's Vineyard if you like ... it's a great place to have your toes in the sand is yeah\nThe gift beyond description and it was wonderful to be able to be there but I think that\nEverywhere on our Cape uh people that get to experience the beauty of our sand dunes of our low tides of the enormous beaches and the remarkable vision that President Kennedy had Dickey rate the Cape cod seashore national monument so we're we're very lucky people and uh\nOur history goes way back obviously made everybody during the Arab Seventeen hundreds Eighteen hundreds already sixteen hundreds came here on a boat\nAnd we have always had a tie our history to the sea and in our merchant efforts or the China trade the caught on top of the state have cod wailing a and\nYou know we don't have cod though I mean this ought to be a message to everybody it's Cape Cod but they're no God\nOr very very few and precious few and it's a it's a tragedy if we don't start paying attention to how we manage these kinds of things we could see an economic impact on our state so what do we need to do today to take care of our I think there were three primary\nChallenges a number one\nClimate change which is caused by greenhouse gases which fall in the ocean and the ... the ocean which has a negative impact on the growth of clams crustaceans shells and bleachers out spawning grounds and coral reefs and so forth around the world\nAre we don't know all the impacts we know it has an impact we don't know the rate of impact we don't know where you could have a precipitous catastrophic impact and so that's why we all at particular respect and concern the second grade impact is pollution general pollution\nPeople build the bill near the ocean there is what we call non source point pollution\nView I've run off the of gasoline runoff from stations you have oil run off you have pesticide runoff you have\nHigh nitrate runoff which affects\nThe level of oxygen in the water and therefore\nThe fish and plants and falling down in the ocean and we have five hundred dead zones around the world and the ocean's today dead zones nothing grows because of what has happened with this overload and also pollution generally it affects the fish you have plastic getting in the marine mammals are into birds\nI seen film of a shark send or board busses end or whales dragging nets around and\nCrazy and then finally we have over fishing\nWe have too much money chasing too few fish\nAnd that's one of the reasons we may cod anymore here\nEight of the top fisheries of the world are now over fished out of this sort of Eighteen or so fisheries principal ones and the others or at or near\nMax so with four hundred and fifty million Chinese who've come out of poverty into the middle class who now have discovered blue tuna and sushi a with four hundred million Indians likewise and people around the world gaining in income and then therefore appetite\nWe have a huge challenge and already about twelve of the protein that people get in the world comes from fish so there's a huge demand for fish is food stock\nAnd increasingly we're going to see pressure on that so those are the Big East but the pollution is just stunning I mean if we continue at the rate we're going there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean and twenty Thirty years\nNow of course you've had a storied career most recently as a diplomat and your background I think he spent some time in France and Switzerland as a kid and your dad was a diplomat but when it comes to the ocean you've had some special concerns and I just want to quickly ask you about ... about to one there's something called the law the sea treaty\nWas something that the United states and the folks from Massachusetts like Ellie Richardson worked on years ago which we've never ratified and now there's talk of having some sort of a high seas treaty um that would govern what is half of the world is not in any dress\nIt's called the high seas and the high seas do not belong to any particular nation but they get egregiously overfished by renegade fishers pirate fisherman and years ago Senator Ted Stevens and I went to the United nations to try to ban the drift net fishing\nWe succeeded it was banned\nBut today you have pirates fishermen renegade fishermen who go out with addressing that address and that is literally thousands of miles of model filament betting that they dropped behind the boat drag allowing it kind of strip mines the ocean and as much as two thirds of the catch\nCertainly fifty percent is called waste cash they just throw it overboard so it's changing the ecology of the ocean by imagine if the vision of a you'll see a strip mining coal or in the land you see it just ravaging everything around that this is what address and that will do and then sometimes it breaks off and\nBecause it just fishes on its own mind it's weighted down the carcasses it sinks to the bottom scavengers clean it off it rises to the topic and an till it gets tangled in a whale or tangled in the propellers of some boat it's a scourge\nAnd we have no enforcement on those high seas or very little enforcement I should say occasionally someone's military ship goes through it and you can check on who's who and what's happening and you can certainly mark what chips or their fishing so we're overfishing\nTalked to me about the climate and your concerns about climate change\nWe face in massive challenge of dealing with climate refugees the prime minister of the Fiji Islands\nI I just met with him the other day at an event in California where he pointed out that they're literally taking refugees from other islands and they themselves are now planning how to move where can they go to be safe\nThey'll lose their nation state which is these islands increased fires increased floods more moisture in the air because of the warming of the ocean more intensity and the storms because of that moisture we're seeing it in a hurricane's we've seen last year\nJust three hurricanes Harvey Irma and Maria\nCost the taxpayer two hundred and sixty five billion dollars one third of the defense department budget for you think of that three storms and it's going to get worse so people who sit there and say well we can't afford to do something or we can't it's crazy it is far more expensive to do nothing or to do very little", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Living on Earth (PRI)", "city": "Brewster", "day": "06"}
