Boston this is living on Earth I'm Steve her with a major study published in the journal of the American Medical Association has found what many people have long suspected eating organic food appears to reduce the risk of cancer\nAmong some sixty nine thousand people tracked by French scientist over several years those whose diets contain more organics had about twenty five percent fewer cancers overall with thirty five percent fewer breast cancer as an older women and the more than Seventy percent reduction in lymphoma\nThis study suggests but does not prove that pesticides and other chemical residues in foods cause cancer but there's no reason to wait for more research when it comes to making food choices advocates say including the president of the environmental working group can cook Ken welcome back to living on earth thanks Davis great to be here\nSo when this study came out it shows strong evidence in support of the long held belief that organic food is better for us how do you feel now that the study is out there\nWell you know I guess I feel as if we should have been doing studies like this a long time ago we really do need to be much more careful about the low levels of carcinogens that we still have in our diet the fact that several cancers here\nDid show or a market decrease to me tells me the organic food is\nProbably targeting the mechanisms that are associated with those cancers and the other thing that's interesting while they speculated about pesticides there are other chemicals in non organic foods that are not allowed in organic certain chemical dies a certain color rings\nA certain flavorings that simply are not allowed in organic food manufacture\nThat in addition to pesticides may be another reason why there's lower cancer rates amongst these are mostly women who are eating more organic food\nAnd of course if the product is made from genetically modified organisms it's not allowed to be labeled as organic\nIs true as well and there really are not very many chemicals that are allowed in organic manufactured are packaged food compared to conventional where there are thousands\n... raised by this study but to me it goes back to the basic point a cleaner set of ingredients closer to nature fewer additives less processing is probably in general playing a role here\nSo how excited are you by this study and how much of the game changer do you think it might become\nWell I find it very encouraging it's just one study that's often said from time to time and they're right\nThey're getting real soon All right Steve thanks a

damaging the Enbridge pipelines and prepared to mount a climate necessity defense\nBut October night in the middle of the trial of Minnesota judge abruptly acquitted them of all charges and they joined me now from Seattle, Washington welcome to living on earth\nFew have these felony charges thrown up on up\nI think we all have mixed feelings about that I've been feeling guilty was you know happiness that\nWe are not going to jail and quite frankly that I'm off bail and\nMay have the opportunity to do civil disobedience again because I had to be very careful while\nOut on bail because if I got arrested it could be revoked and I could spend all of my time in the Clearwater county jail awaiting trial but um you know we're disappointed that we did not get to put on the climate necessity defense that we wanted to with you know it'd be very well respected\nExperts that we had lined up to testify\nFor us like Dr James Hansen you know former climate scientists from Nassau and Bill McKibben so it's a mixed bag\nAnd ... yeah I I'll go being stronger about it than that and say that you know I was really heartbroken not so much by the acquittal of course which is a good thing it was sort of second best scenario we could have had\nBut by the denial of our expert witness testimony on climate change and on civil disobedience you know it would have been the dream trial it could have made a really big difference so they thought that this kind of trial might happen in that courtroom in front of those jurors and that might make set a precedent that would really have\nAn impact nationally on the climate change debate seemed like a really important thing to\nMe and of course until four days before trial began it looked very much like it was going to happen\nSo you know it it's a real shame that that it did not\nKnow as I understand that you've heard a booth charged to let you use the necessity defense\nYes and he had granted that to us back in October of twenty Seventeen and in fact he had copies of our expert witness list for a for about the last year and a half\nSo at any point in that time period he could have constrained us constrain the number of witnesses said you can't talk about this or that and he chose not to so the fact that he did that for days before trial began with studying at the lawyers ... couldn't have been more surprised we couldn't have been more surprised\nUntil that moment he'd been very very reasonable and it seemed like all systems were go and to be clear the thing about that that was so striking apart from its sudden his was the fact\nThat normally speaking defendants do not have any burden of proof it's it's the prosecution that has the burden of proof normally but because we were going to use a necessity defense and say that what we did you know was essentially a necessary under these circumstances that we find ourselves and to prevent the greater harm of climate change\nWe did have the burden of proof and all of a sudden he knocked out our ability\nBecause who is going to listen to a poet a retired lawyer and a software engineer from Seattle on climate change you know we're not scientists we have no authority so no matter\nHow articulate we had been it\nWouldn't have had anything like the same impact as the former head of the NASA Goddard Space Center talking about climate change and how urgent it is or about Minnesota scientists talking about how urgent it is and how much is already changing in Minnesota so you know again we had no ability to defend ourselves without experts to testify to those things\nAnd the software engineering or co defendant was\nThat was ... a young father of three who was our support person or support people were all arrested they went in knowing that that was a possibility but it was certainly our hope and we're planning the action that they would not be arrested so we're very very happy that he's acquitted in home with\nHis young family were happy that he's acquitted but I personally am very sorry he didn't get to testify in the necessity defense hearing a in August a year ago when he testified there was not a dry and there were um\nYou know when he talked about his young children and what they were facing\nAnd then the case becomes even more confusing I guess because the judge says in the one hand you can have witnesses to make your case and then he proceeds to go ahead to quit you of the charges right\nThat was after the prosecutor had presented his case which\nWas only two witnesses the sheriff who arrested us and and local Enbridge employee and all he proved was that we had broken some chains that were holding the locked into the enclosure where the emergency shut off valve was and we never disputed that\nSo we were charged under a statute which was one of the sort of enhance penalties statutes that are being shoved through state legislatures right now by the fossil fuel industry\nTo give them you know further penalties against protesters and the statute we were charged under was specifically damage to pipelines\nAnd the judge ruled and he was correct that\nThe prosecutor had not prove that we had damaged the pipeline and anyway\nYeah and he he was he was ruling that there wasn't evidence for a reasonable jury to convict us basic right that as a matter of law then that was because of course we hadn't damage that pipeline right\nI'm going to ask you to speculate about both of you in a ... about judge Robert Tiffany and the decisions that you made in your case how do you think the judiciary might have been influenced by outside forces politics sentiment\nThis is Emily in terms of you know what kind of pressured he may have been under or what he may have been I'm thinking you know whether\nHis mind might have changed about what kind of precedent he wanted to that and so forth you know it's it's impossible to know and and it's you know distressing and it's certainly something we've been wondering about\nHe seems like a very reasonable guy he gave us a necessity defense he wanted to hear what we had to say and he wanted to let the jury hear it so you know the about faceless quite extreme\nWe know for sure that Enbridge provide something like two thirds of the budget of that county so I you know they obviously have some influence direct or indirect we don't know I mean we have no way to know what may or may not have happened behind the scenes but the fossil fuel companies have\nTerrible amounts of influence and power in this country and you know that's why we have to fight them and the ways that we have to fight them because they do on and control our political system all on all levels\nTo what extent did you understand what do you do this direct action the law enforcement could bring felony charges against you know\nWe absolutely knew that that was not only a possibility but a strong probability and we accept that risk\nI personally feel I'm sixty six years old and I feel that it is my job as an elder and it is my job because I Am an old like woman who has the privilege of not having the cop show up and shoot me on site if I Do something like that",
