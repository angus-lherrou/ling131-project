shredded buildings with the sheer force of its category for wins and swept away entire neighborhoods with an eight to twelve foot storm surge\nMichael is the third strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the continental United States\nIt pass through quickly though and drop less rain that other recent major hurricane such as Laurence Harvey Irma and Maria only the Labor Day hurricane of Nineteen thirty five and hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine had lower their metric pressures a key measure of hurricane strength\nAnd even some storm experts were surprised by how hurricane Michael intensified from a category one to the category for just twenty four hours\nHere to talk about this unprecedented storm and it's possible Climate Connections we welcome another Michael back to the show Michael Mann is a climate expert at Penn State University Welcome back to living on earth Michael\nThank Steve it's good to be with you\nSo why did hurricane Michael intensify so quickly\nSo it encountered warm a sea surface temperatures on in the low eighties in the region where it intensified and it became a major hurricane those temperatures are between two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperate\nWater so warm there there's just a fluke or are we looking at a trend\nSo there's been a degree Celsius of warming globally the oceans of warmed up and it's an ocean heat wave and the notion heat wave just like a normal heat wave is made much more likely with even a modest warming of the planet\nA hurricane Michael brought some pretty intense storm surges eight twelve feet and some of the coastal areas there how much the sea level rise factor into the storm surge these days\nWell you know sea level rise depending on where you are in the Gulf Coast or the U.S east coast or has been somewhere between half a foot and a foot and that's the warming of the planet the melting of the ice that's us sea level rise adds to the storm surge of every single storm that makes landfall in the case of Sandy a Superstorm Sandy in twenty twelve at at a foot\nTwo that are Thirteen foot storm surge might sound like a modest amount a one foot well it meant twenty five more square miles of a coastal flooding it meant several\nBillion dollars worth of additional damage on the same thing with Florence making landfall in North Carolina again about a foot of sea level rise added to that storm surge\nHow much more frequent will be storms be particularly the hurricane Michael type this sort of intense quick pop up\nOf the things that we're seeing with warmer in warmer ocean temperatures you're more likely to see what we call rapid intensification and we we've seen this now so many times where a storm balloons\nFrom a minor tropical storm to a major hurricane over the course of a day or two and that only happens over very warm sees and are we getting more\nOf these very intense storms these category you know three four five storms and that's where the science is actually the strongest in fact there's a relationship\nFor a category five storm you get an increase of roughly seven percent\nIn the maximum wind speeds for each degree Fahrenheit warming of the ocean now that seven percent increase in wind speed might sound modest but the destructive potential of a storm goes as the third power of the wind speed\nIt was seven percent increase in wind speed is it Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential of the storm that's for one degree Fahrenheit well with Michael those temperatures were two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures if you do the math\nThat means it was probably twice as destructive as it would have been in the absence of human\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nWithin one and a half degrees Celsius for the pre industrial temperatures what\nDo we know now about how hurricanes could behave with the world it's more than one and a half degrees warmer than before the industrial age\nYeah so for each you know half a degree Celsius it's the better part of one degree Fahrenheit\nThere that's a Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential the storms that means noticeably more damage it also means for each half a degree Celsius\nYou have a about four percent more moisture in the atmosphere so you're going to increase the potential for those flooding rains and of course it's impacting uh lots of other weather extremes and global sea level rise and all of these other attributes of climate that we are sensitive to\nIn the past or the PC has been the conservative that when the data comes into the projections have been uh been lower than the actual numbers how do you think this report will fare or when the actual data comes in\nSo I I criticize this latest report for once again being\nOverly conservative and its portrayal of the science and and I'll tell you it has to do with a very specific criticism in this case it's the way that they measured the warming that has happened and the PCC has chosen to measure the overall warming that's taken place\nUsing a baseline that starts in the late Eighteen hundreds and and the reason for that is well that's how far back that their mom and her measurements go here's the problem human caused warming began back in the Seventeen hundreds when you know industrialization began so every tenth of a degree Celsius\nOf warming that's happened makes it that much more difficult to stabilize below one point five maybe it's impossible now one point five\nTwo point oh or there's still a clear path toward stabilizing warming below two degrees Celsius but it turns out that if you look at our budget how much carbon do we have left that we can burn in avoid two degrees Celsius if you take in what might sound like a small\nTargeted killing for the military of a foreign power

their ongoing support\nThe more things change the more they stay the same goes the French aphorism\nPopular author Barbara Kingsolver has a brilliant take on these unsettling time in her new novel on sheltered it's agree to look at a family crisis in modern America Laird over the narrative of a story that unfolded in the same New Jersey town over a century earlier\nVineland New Jersey was first settled in the late Eighteen hundreds of utopian experiment and the social issues there as imagined and Barbara Kingsolver book unfiltered resonate equally with America's reality back then\nAnd today she joins us now welcome back to living on her Hi thanks for having me\nBarbara Kingsolver this is your first novel and what six years so what brought you the idea of writing what became on sheltered no\nWell it's one of those books that took a while to cook I spent several years thinking about\nHow to write about paradigm shift that's what I think we're doing right now I think we're in the moment when so many things that we've always\nBelieved in as truth unquestionable are suddenly starting to feel not true anymore it's a moment that feels like price like the end of the world as we know it and want to say permanent truths things like\nWell like there will always be a job at the end of the college degree or tenure at the end of the track or or a a pension at the end of a career or good health care or even things like ice\nOn the polls that will stay frozen or that there will always be more efficient messy we're reaching a moment in history when all those shelters are failing us\nSo your device if I can use that word of course is to have to families yeah living more than a century apart yeah in the same house All right and of course it's falling down [laughter] you know literally it's literally falling down\nAnd that's another thing that is in question these days where is it safe to live you know the occasional hurricane or maybe there's going to be a a a huge forest fire or or whatever in fact you yourself you move from the southwest back to Virginia because you could see that there ain't going to be too much water there in Arizona\nFactly exactly that it was already\nBut everything people use their and needed to be brought in from the outside and in fact we are kind of living on a spaceship and we've been\nLiving on it for a long well I mean not in terms of\nYou know human evolution but in terms of presents civilization we've been just operating on the presumption that our culture and our economy can grow infinitely just the presumption of infinite gross I'm\nPast somewhere and\nWe just keep throwing more more of the same old\nRequest at the world of give me more give me more let's grow more or less um growth and consumption are are the answer a seem to be the answer to our prayers so what happens when it seems like you're praying the wrong prayer\nSo if I were to go through the various issues that are confronting people today aside from\nThe fact that it does seem kind of falling apart just sort of randomly you address parenting romance among grownups women and science of evolution climate feral cats bought me fresh local food suicide tenure boat and did I leave out Trump\n[laughter] I Hope [laughter] I Know\nHe's not he's not mentioned by name any resemblance to people living or dead is a pure coincidence\nOh so you're a lawyer told you to say [laughter] I don't want to get those tweets [laughter]\n[noise] no without giving too much away let's talk let's talk more about the historical aspects of this book [noise] the next door neighbor married treat is very much a a real scientist will lure due to include Mary Treat in the store\nAnd the twenty first century story these are all characters of my invention living through very real uncertainty however the character's living sort of at the corner of six straight and disaster in Eighteen Seventy five\nAre real they're mostly real people so Mary Treat the naturalists who is that the next door neighbor who becomes a\nKind of a larger than life figure she was real she's a real person who I found it fascinating to research she really was the lightning rod for this novel but it took me to find land\nI as I said I was thinking for a couple of e\nBig question about how people behave in times of crisis and I had chosen\nI knew that I wanted to set it in two different centuries and my historical story around the time of the release of Darwin's two bucks which just\nPretty much blue everybody's mind not generally and a good way mostly for the worse it was really unsettling powerfully disorienting for people to encounter the proposition that possibly\nHumans were not put here to rule the era that we actually are part of the year it was really hard for people to accept that in fact it's hard for people to accept that now so I wanted I wanted to touch\nThe earlier part of the novel in the middle of that that moment when\nDarwin had released his books and I wanted to find a champion of Darwin who lived in the U.S [noise] and I looked I looked at Darwin himself I read a lot about his correspondents in the U. S. I read a lot about aids and gray Iran across the name\nMary Treat a woman I'd never heard mentioned before she's not very well known\nI looked a little deeper and discovered she had a really interesting life and she lives in Vineland that's utopian communities and so I went there I read her archive I walked around Vineland and discovered that the place that's exactly the place I wanted to set this book\nNot to mention that she was a woman on science yeah we did a great job the one ... on record but she has a personal correspondence with Charles Darwin\nNobody knows about her she wrote a lot about nature for people who are not scientists a lot of her work was published in the Atlantic monthly and Harper's so she was ... she was really interesting woman who could\nTalk to people at every level from Charles Darwin to the ladies botany clubs that she founded in her town so she had this I like to think of as a particularly woman Lee capacity to be accessible to really make her science comprehensible\nYou know what the way you do her story reminds me of the story Barbara McClintock road\nShe guessing a Nobel Prize in physiology and yet she wasn't taken seriously for what you do them well genes\nAnd at one point um so I have a question for you along these lines about how women are both ignored in the work that they do but also in education\nHow different do you think the American discussion about climate change climate destruction today would be if in fact women overtime or the well integrated into science and technology and such\nWell that's a fascinating theoretical question and I can't\nReally imagine how I Would\nAnswer it and in a scientific way because there's no control group there is no alternate\nUniverse where women were allowed to be scientists freely but I think so much about Rachel Carson she's the person I I really admire\nThe first person in the United states to speak to to speak beyond scientific circles\nTo everyday people if you looked at Silent Spring it's an amazing document it was a best selling\nWork of nonfiction it was very readable very accessible and the years of its publication and if you look in that book it has chemical formulas in it it has drawings of carbon out of that I think\nThey would do this this woman is brilliant woman who had the moxie to say yeah I understand science and I think everybody else can understand that too I just have to take the time to respect the leg reader to respect everyday people and and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Living on Earth (PRI)", "city": "Brewster", "day": "20"}
