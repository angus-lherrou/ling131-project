majority now on the U.S Supreme Court parties looking to broaden environmental protections under the law can expect plenty of push back\nThe bruising and bitter battles that confirmed Brett Kavanaugh as the newest associate justice centered more on allegations of sexual assault and temperament and his judicial record\nBut a close look at justice Kavanaugh's rulings during his dozen years on the DC circuit court of appeals reveals strong and well crafted opinions that restrain government action on pollution and habitat safeguards\nTo discuss the influence justice Kavanaugh's likely to have on the high court's environmental docket we turned out it from a law school professor pat parental welcome back to the program Patt thanks stay good to be with you know justice Brett Kavanaugh's been closely related to a number of environmental cases why why is that\nWell he's been on the DC circuit court of appeals which is the second most important court to the Supreme Court in the country for going on eleven or twelve years he's written three hundred different opinions of which\nProbably afford maybe it dealt with either environmental law directly or administrative law issues that relate to environmental laws so he has quite a track record of writing opinions and environmental cases\nSo typically how has justice cabinet are ruled on these regulatory cases involving environmental law\nWell he styles himself in the manner of or the late Justice Scalia who is a textural less a strict construction is and what that means of course is that he looks to the text of a statute when he's asked to interpret it\nAnd if the text isn't clear enough oftentimes he will rule against and agencies interpretation\nAnd an environmental arena that oftentimes means that rules which are trying to increase the level of protection for public health in the environment don't often fit\nSquarely within the plain text of a statute the statutes are general and vague often agencies try to interpret

and I'm Steve her with hurricane Michael quickly blew up into a devastating category for storm\nAs it entered warm waters in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico is yet another example of the increasing number of major weather events linked to climate disruption and according to a recent report from scientists with the inter governmental panel\nIf we can expect more and more dire events such as Michael with only seemingly small increases in the globe's average surface temperatures\nThe twenty Fifteen Paris climate agreement calls for no more than a two degrees centigrade increase from pre industrial conditions and suggested limiting the rise to one point five degrees would be beneficial\nBut this new report finds that half degrees difference poses huge risks keeping below that one and a half degrees centigrade goal is going to be tough but the impact of failure will be even tougher says Princeton professor Michael Oppenheimer\nProfessor Oppenheimer has been a lead author Frye PCC reports for years and joins us now welcome back living on earth Michael glad to be here again\nI'll be cut to the chase how scared you by this latest report from the IPC see\nI don't get scared about this issue because I've been living with it for thirty five years and uh if it scared me I Would have gone crazy a long time ago however any sane person would take away a very very sobering message upon reading this report\nThe effects of climate change are already here they are projected to worsen over time and the point at which the risks are related to climate change that is that the possibility of very big impacts starts to increased markedly\nIs not toward the end of this century but very close a matter of a decade or two away if we do nothing or more or less nothing like we're doing now to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that are causing the problem\nSo what's the basic premise of this report it and and why was it issued in the first place\nReport has an unusual origin the inter governmental panel on climate change produces far oh assessments of all our knowledge on climate change every six years or so\nAnd then in between those major assessments that produces very quick and pointed assessments of pieces of the problem\nFor instance I'm working on the next these are called special reports and I'm working on the next special report which is on the oceans and the icy parts of Earth like the ice sheets the report they just came out\nIs on the question of what is the level at which we should restrain warming in order not to enter a danger zone where the risks are just so high that we may just as a group of societies not be able to\nWill because it's pointed at a single very specific issue that has high policy relevance\nNow what are the headlines from this latest IPC report is that we have just a dozen years twelve years or twenty thirty or so to get our act together to reach the net zero output in carbon emissions to what extent do you agree with that finding and how do we possibly get there\nTo be Frank about it I don't think we're going to get there\nAnd I also think that partly because of that\nThe framing that we have twelve years left or else is wrong\nIt's counterproductive it'll just scare people in the report they frame it that way that's been a framing that the media has has put on it is sort of like twelve years of we don't do what we should do the world comes to an end that's not the case the reality is\nAt every step you do the best you can and if you don't quite make the target\nYou try to do a little better in the next decade or the next couple of decades the world doesn't come to an end cause that is\nThe risk just increased markedly and it becomes very very hard to cope eventually that doesn't mean that society's will completely disintegrate some well I can tell you that sea level rise is going to destroy some coastal societies particularly on small islands staged by that will make life just\nMiserable extensive and uncomfortable for the rest of us\nSo what are the biggest challenges in this report or in terms of lemonade warming to the degree and a half century\nContrary to what most people think ah the report finds that the challenges are not primarily technological the costs are going to be decreasing overtime although they never going to be entirely negligible\nBut the real obstacle is a social and political one how do you get societies organized to actually reinvent themselves to be not independence of fossil fuels\nYou're saying the primary challenge to limit warming to one and a half degrees centigrade is us what impact do we need to do than as a society as as governments to the limit this morning I I Know there are many many aspects to it but but briefly what do we need to do\nThe most general level what we need to do is abandon using fossil fuels as primary energy sources that means getting rid of coal the primary source of carbon dioxide from electric\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nProbably the biggest challenges that there's so much carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere that\nEven if we slow down markedly are ... and individually eliminated dependence on fossil fuels we need probably need to find a way to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get towards the ... century it seems we're going to need a way\nTo suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things\nThe third thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency and production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we have a very spread out\nPattern of development and that pattern automatically guarantees high energy use\nSo tell us why two degrees centigrade will be even worse than the already ambitious goal of one and a half degrees centigrade why does just half a degree make such a difference according to this particular report\nSo when the report was called for two thousand and Fifteen a lot of\nScientists were skeptical that they would be much of a difference in the impacts between one and a half two degrees\nBut because the government's call for the report a lot of scientists went out and started doing research focused specifically on the difference between one and a half to two degrees it's become clear that particularly with regard to extreme heat\nAnd flooding that they were big differences between one and a half and two degrees I mean give me an example already by one and a half degrees there are places a particularly islands in the Pacific and megacities all around the world for which the incidence of the benchmark hundred year\nStorm or a hundred year flood event I should call it\nIncreases markedly even by one and a half degrees so that you're getting at that level what is today a a one and a hundred year event becomes a yearly events think about that we don't deal with those kinds of events effectively now even though they're very rare what happens when they're happening all the time\nPark the lenders living on earth explorer in residence for more including photos go to our

R. G.\nI began the second part of our talk by asking Secretary Kerry they consider the issue of stranded assets as it applies to climate change\nLet me ask you just to think reflect on this for a moment looking at American history in Eighteen sixty\nIn the south there was more monetary value in slaves\nThan there was in the land or Eighteen sixty five that was a classic stranded asset all that value disappeared to what extent today do you think we're being held hostage by folks who think that all that fossil fuel and the ground which is on balance sheet at billions and billions and billions of dollars\nAnd it can't all be burned if we understand the science correctly to what extent are we headed down a path to solve the problem we had was slavery I mean there's the moral question there\nJust like we have today with climate as well as the economic question to solve that problem we wound up in a pretty in a very bloody war yeah idle at I mean I don't think that's the choice for for America now I think that I think uh most of the executives I Know that the higher level of the oil industry or all diverse\nOh the be all investing in New energy they're ready to move where the market we'd go and uh\nI mean we're not going to be able to transition fast enough that you suddenly dry up and not have oil or gas and ... there's going to be alone and gas for a while it's just the nature of the beast we've got to try to guarantee is not for two alone\nWhy I'm simply listening to the scientists I mean I'm listening to the end and understanding the science if we don't move off fossil fuels fast enough\nWe could reach what's called a tipping point where things begin to cascade down words in a spiral of destruction and dying of dying sees dying trees dying species of various kinds because it's not sustainable\nAnd if you get into that kind of a spiral nobody knows nobody can tell you how you break out of it I'm just applying the precautionary principle of the idea of governing\nMean we buy insurance to make sure our of our home burned down we're going to be able to rebuild it we buy a car insurance to fix the rack and hope in our life insurance and then somebody lost the life the family's okay\nWhy we buy insurance against the death and destruction that will come with increased storms and increase climate change it's beyond my understanding why are we going to have a president who is a denial of the science\nNinety eight percent of all the scientists in the world who ever watch this and looked at it with peer reviewed studies peer reviewed studies\nAll say this is happening happening now and it's caused by not exclusively but largely by human beings and we don't respond to this whoa whoa to so many of them were entering into the sort of suicide packed\nIt could be worse than the United states civil war that right now we are heading I you know the goal in Paris was to keep the rise of the earth's temperature\nTo two degrees centigrade\nAnd we were going to try to excite enough nations to become involved that we could meet that standard we now know at the current rate we're not meaning that standard we're heading now towards four degrees centigrade rise in the temperature of the average temperature of the planet\nThat's catastrophic you'll have water battles you will have refugees moving you think we have tough migration challenges today wait all people can't produce food and various parts of the world will their water dries up and they're not able to live what happens when the oceans change and you have a migration away from certain stocks that people are\nJust so many unknowns here I'm not willing to just throw up my hands and sail someone's going to take care of this because that's just not responsible given the input\nBack in the day as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts which is not exactly ordinarily a very exciting position you made your mark jumping on the acid rain but tell me what did that teach you about the politics of environmental protection\nThat reasonable people with a reasonable purpose in public life\nAre able to work together Republican and Democrat in order to do things that are good for American citizens I was a lieutenant governor but Michael Dukakis are allowed me to be the chair of the governors task force for him\nI worked with Governor John Sununu in New Hampshire I worked with Governor Dix the last of Ohio and we put together the three of us a and approach\nDrawn up by the way by the American Enterprise Institute is conservative approach to how to use the market to be able to\nAccomplish something you want to accomplish and there was a market incentives for people to actually buy in trade sulfur which reduce the amount of self or we we got acid rain under control through the system and then when I was in the Senate I was able to use that and put it into the clean Air Act\nAnd so it became part of the national program so you don't hear about it I said right now\nWe could do the same thing for climate change if we had the leadership that was willing to recognize", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Living on Earth (PRI)", "city": "Brewster", "day": "13"}
