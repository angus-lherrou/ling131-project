D. three eighty nine points in Boston at nine the emergence of Joni Mitchell were going to continue with this series last week was Joanie lyrics this time records and picking as tend to be our ex remarried so random stuff some of the titles cowboys and mailman wide berth selling freeze\nAnd life on the net for probably\nAbout the invention of race an hour long documentary about racial ideas right up the colonial America and how we live with races today but first so we'll go to the local food report\nAnd Vicki Merrick the local food reports up now with Alastair hay and this time I was to get some tips on how to revive an old garden\nMy husband's grandmother kept a big garden for years roughly Fifteen by thirty feet and only sell the beans tomatoes cucumbers in peace she passed away a few years ago and the land is still in the family\nBut over the past few seasons it's been neglected and it's over ground I Wonder if I saw the other day I stopped by to talk with my friend Luke ... house and farm in Brewster he pointed me to a large area he didn't find this yeah covered in Leeds and he just mowed down\nThis is the twenty by eighty I'll just cover sick with mulch and leave it there and then everything underneath will die so if you know implants don't get some like they'll basically they can't grow so everything underneath\nNice thick layer of mulch all the worms calm bacteria flourishing all that's double which isn't that much doubled breakdown\nLucas uses a no till approach on his one acre farm it's a technique that's exactly what it sounds like I'm like many farmers and even home gardeners he doesn't tell his soil instead he uses mulch is to reduce erosion increase organic matter and water retention and improve nutrient cycling\nBelief mulch he uses it basically just shredded leaves dropped off by landscapers he'd rather bring it to him than to the dump where do you think is thick enough\n[noise] um four inches you know depending let us know blows off in the winter but usually be tried tried to do before a big rain and then it kind of come packs and kind of sticks together\nUm but I've I've covered like new areas of Saud would leave mold with leaf mulch and never told it and planted right through it so like I had to wait about a year but then I just basically brought for to kind of raise the soil where I was gonna plant and\nUm you really don't need to tell if you're going that direction do you ever do like salt hay or see we yeah we like I'll go down this time of year and pick up some seaweed I'm just down the coast of mule grass and then just I'll just spread it like if I'm going to cover a sticker of in an area with stick with multiple just spread like\nYou know a couple of wheelbarrows see underneath it\nThere isn't much literature on the benefits of seaweed but old timers say it brings nutrients and trace minerals from the sea and any organic matter breaks down to add structure it that's good for soil Lucas also uses ... basically large black plastic tarps that block the sun and breakdown weeds\nAnd he says whether you've got an established growing area or a starting a new one this is the time of year to be getting ready\nSo you'll do saw test and basically just you know make sure the ages in order and then you know other stuff like that calcium stuff like that so it's easier to do in the off season so like do you really deficient or something you know you have a good three or four months for it to to get it in and have habits are activating him and kind of correcting\nWhat the levels are in your soil can help you solve simple problems like if you don't have enough calcium your tomatoes can get blossom ... or if you're missing bore on your turn obsolete black and hollow in the center\nIf you test before you spread any kind of cover you can add amendment's first like if your ph was low and your soil is too acidic you could spread lime or if you were lacking nutrients overall you might spread compost or ...\nTo cover crop something cold hardy like a legume or winter rye\nYou know rise good like rise not going to be putting nutrients into your soil per se so that's why a lot of people mix like a like a leg room and was winter rye\nPeas clover so he's a great 'cause they can climb kind of on the rise to let it gets all um but usually over she'd with with a leg room to fix nitrogen\nUm oats is a similar cover crop to winter rye but it it it's ... you know it's supposed to winter kill so it's not supposed to be hard enough to to make it through the winter so it's a little bit easier to deal with in the spring\nThat's what this whole approach is about putting in some work now so that when spring comes the garden is ready to be planted this past spring I clear just enough space in our family's last garden to plant a few rows of beans drying\nBlack turtle math facts and ... they were surrounded by weeds but they did well enough we've got about three quarters of dried beans from six short rows and they added some nitrogen for next season\nI was thinking we need a rotor Tiller to break ground next spring but after talking Lucas I'm going to start with a soil test and after that maybe some amendments seaweed and a thick layer of mulch\nFor another UCA ice local food apart I Know that hey\nIf you want to learn more about no till and low input farming who doesn't outfits recommends a book by\nMain farmer and author will bundle on what he calls radical self reliant gardening we've got that title and more about bringing back a garden right at our

information I paint dry\nUp and down the mention of race and racism are giving to our world today it's\nAn hour long documentary adapted from the hard\nCan only do in this\nWhite highly recommend that you're on to my [noise]\nHello\nHi so what does that even mean anyway\nFrom the center for documentaries studies at Duke University this is the invention of race\nThe story of how we got so called white people and black people and yellow and read\nAnd the other ever shifting race labels assigned to human beings in the first place [noise]\nAnd John be when I hosts the podcast scene on radio racially loaded disputes and shouting matches make headlines day after day year after year in the United states\nIt's a given in our national discourse that we're a society made up of all the races and ethnicities on the\nAnd that we have a painful history of discrimination and exploitation often tied to race\nDeep divisions and inequities persist today what we don't often consider is where did all this come from the very idea of different races of human beings from God\nNature or was it man may and if people manufactured race why\nAnd who did it [noise] I spoke with leading scholars who've done the most up to date and cutting edge research on the construction of race as we know it [noise] in this hour\nHow it actually went down from ancient history to the founding of the United states as a white man's country\nChapter one the making of black and white\n[noise] and maybe you know of course your book starts thousands of years ago but here's a thought I had above the starting point which is um\n[noise] when I was in high school in Minnesota in the late Nineteen seventies I ... I can still remember very vividly in my social studies textbook\nThe three races man yeah and I can see the images of the ... the ... and the ... yeah [noise]\nUm it was presented as a scientific biological fact that's right sort of like the you know yeah there are certain kinds of rocks and here's the map of the world and then these are the three race yeah so um [noise]\nThe ... ... was basically considered to be the fourteenth century's greatest world Traveller so he travels\nAll the way over to Asia [noise] up in through Eastern Europe in the middle east he also traveled into some sour Africa and he of course wrote about his travels and\nDescribed a sub Saharan Africa specifically the Mali are empire and so he he visited Molly and spoke quite glowing about Mali and how for instance that you know you traveled many places but in Mali you know he felt\nSo uh spoke about sort of the civilization of the people and other things that sort\nAnd when he went back to to Morocco and wrote that some of the armchair intellectuals thought he she must be line\nBut to just claims about the glories of Mali were shouted down as lies for a very practical reason is Islamic Moroccan society was busy inflating people from sub Saharan\nAfrica as well as slots from Eastern Europe\nAnd go to classify these people are not inferior would've been a of course a difficult for slave traders just as if people didn't ... laws as inferior would have been bad businesses were\n\nAbout a century after even been to to erode admiring Lee about West African kingdoms a Portuguese man wrote a book and here we get to the brim candies culprit his name was gum as days Aurora\nAs candy recounts the king of Portugal had hired to rod rod to write a biography of the king's uncle and find the Enrique better known as prince Henry the navigator\nWho of course was the first major a slave trader to exclusively in slave trade in an African people from of course Portugal and in the mid ... fourteen hundred\nRiding in fourteen fifty threes Aurora chronicles and glorifies prints Henry's historic voyage a decade before it was the first time European failed to sub Saharan Africa to these captive directly rather than buying sub Saharan slaves from North African middlemen\nAnd describing the resulting slave auction back in\nPortugal and fourteen forty four there are a lump together the very different looking captives some lighter skinned to our egg people others much darker\nHe claimed the prints Henry's main motive was to bring them to Christianity [noise] so is there are portrayed slavery as an improvement over freedom in Africa\nWhere he rode they lived like beasts they had no understanding of good but only knew how to live in peace deals lawn\nAnd and so I basically make the case that he was the first articulate or a breakthrough ideas in in order for him to articulate a racist idea you have to basically combine all the different ethnic groups that prints Henry wasn't inflaming into one or men describing that people\nThey're really speak as much about white and he certainly created blackness and a blackness of course cannot really operate without white [noise]\n\nAnd they can be this is crucial um there are I was not just some independent chronic color calling them as he saw them as I said before he was hired to write the book by the Portuguese king rents Henry's Matthew\nRah rah was also a member of the military order of Christ which was like this power a sort of military slash Christian organization similar to our demise of temple are and who was the leader of the military order\nPrice prints Henry and when prince and fix something you were member you did it including may make him look good for for slave trade [noise]\nSo it's it's fair to say literally that slave traders commissioned the invention of this sort of codified racist idea about black people and implicitly that on the other hand if white people\nYes\nRaul Ross writings were widely circulated among the elite in Portugal in the coming years the Portuguese and their ideas about Africans lead the way as the African slave trade expanded among countries like Spain Holland France and England\nAnd then my other Fifteen hundred you had other ideologues expressing similar ideas about African people so the concept of the beast ... becomes sort of the way in which for instance the first British slave traders described are African people\n[noise] so so when the British colonists came to the United states what would become the United states they were steeped in these ideas is it fair to say\nYes and so I make the case then I saw the show\nThe pervasive myth of racist ideas I'm In England before or in the early sixteen hundred to sort of show the environment that these column if we're we're brought up in and the racist ideas that were circulating and how not only did they bring over bags they they brought a release racist ideas of their mind [noise]\n\nThere was more work to do to refine so called blackness and lightness as we have inherited those concepts in the United states today [noise] chapter to the hardening of race and slavery in the colonies\n... yes isn't it [noise]\nWe Americans are notorious for not knowing or carrying much about history but most of us do have a general picture in our minds of American style slavery\nOur schools teach it in the antebellum south has made recurring appearances in massively popular novels movies and TV series\n[noise] ... yeah I Know I'm not caught 'em or playing Marcia was to Tom ... gives you know ... or do we take away [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\nSome of those portrayals had been much more unvarnished than others more willing to show just how monstrous it all was for two hundred and fifty years\nOwning and buying and selling of human beings generation upon generation all of it justified by stunningly arrogant notions of racial superiority and supremacy\nAnd the inevitable resistance by those human beings held in bondage white slave owners answered it with waves and waves of violence\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] [noise]\nThe standard American explanation for that brutal society is to say well it was the times everybody was doing it the Brits brought it with them\nAs we've seen there's a lot of truth in that in our hemisphere Spanish colonists practice chattel slavery and South America before the English introduced it in the north\nBut our peculiar institution as white southerners charming we referred to their brand of slavery was made and what would become the United states [noise] it's ... framework based on rigid notions of race and sex\nWas constructed on this continent plank or playing\nProcess started not too long after the first African people landed in Jamestown\nOn a Dutch ship in sixteen Nineteen [noise] about twenty people do\nBut the project took decades to complete [noise] has will see the innovations that built slavery American style are inseparable from the construction of blackness and whiteness as we know them today\nAnd if we know how we made it if we know how it was constructed then we have\nA better opportunity to deconstruct\nAfter the break we'll pick up the story from the construction of race in America\nThe specialist drawn from fourteen part series on our pod cast scene on radio in the series is called seeing white it takes a deeper dive into the making of racism then in particular what white nest means and how it works in the world\nYou can find scene on radio that's S. C. E. N. E. on radio on your favorite pie cap\nOr at the non radio dot org stay with us Mm\n\n\nMm\nIt's important\nThat we see this creation was for the up with demand of white people primarily to support the white people at the top\nPoor and working class whites will get little\nThey will get just as much as if needed to ensure their allegiance [noise]\nAnd other major legal step in the making of white supremacy and the new world was\nPassage of the Virginia slave codes Seventeen oh five\nThe codes officially defined in a slave people of color as real estate and strip them of most of their rights [noise]\nMade it illegal for black people to employ white people\nAllowed ... to apprehend any black person they suspected of being around\nAnd effectively permitted slave owners to torture their slaves to death\nDeciding who comments\nSo we got a skip ahead a hundred years [noise]\nThat is now Seventeen nine the year in which the almost new United States of America conducted its first\nNinety years Nell Irvin Painter she's the Princeton history professor America and author of the history of white people\nSo the U.S census is a an instrument of government it's not meant as a scientific classification to to to float above any policy or material questions it really it's it's an instrument to be applied\nSo let's count up people in terms that are useful\nAnd for the U.S government or Seventeen Ninety doing it senses under the direction of the secretary of state a slave owner by the name of Thomas Jefferson\nWe have three kinds of white people and then we have slaves and then we have\nOther free people to spell that out a bit more the first US Census counted people in these categories white males sixteen and older white males under sixteen white females all other free persons\nAnd slaves remember enslaved people were counted as three fifths of a person for purposes of taxation and representation in Congress and were they assumed to be black\nI don't know I Would assume so but I don't know right what I Do know is that free is added to white\nIt's not that white by itself means free\nRight so that suggests that there were on free white people exactly it also effectively does it not um defined American American citizen as a white person\nThat comes more clearly with the naturalization act act to Seventeen Ninety\nSeventeen Ninety four seeding our first Congress and the first session the second act is the naturalization act and the Dina have\nGreen is managing director of the racial equity Institute at that same workshop in Charlotte have green picked up the story of the making of race in the U.S by talking about the next thing Congress authorized after that first census\nNaturalization access only free whites\nCan be naturalized citizens what ... what were the rights of citizenship\nAnd the United states\nAccessing rights to due process\nAble to start a business that on a jury\nWhat we're saying here this is the first time that you're going to see a race you're going to see white written into the documents that speak to our national identity [noise]\nWe talk a lot about race has just been around for a long time to slavery and oppression had been around for a long time but we can say specifically that race the way it's been institutionalized in the United states we have a very specific place in our history and in our country where race is showing up\nSo white supremacy was established firmly and rigidly and the colonies and the hard truth is that the founding fathers built white dominance into the fabric and the laws of the new United States laws to determine who could homeland who got to vote and hold office\nWho was permitted to marry or have sex with\nHim [noise] and who could own [noise]\nSuzanne implicit racial equity Institute says knowing this history it's easier to see with clarity what racism is simply Suzanne says it's a system of advantage based on race\nIt is all about power it revolves on power [noise] it is not prejudice is not racial prejudice is not bigotry and his power\n[laughter]\nChapter three the United states\n[noise] we gather\nFor from the greatness of our nation here's Brock Obama looking so much younger in two thousand four democratic convention speech that propelled him toward the presidency our pride is based on a very simple from summed up\nIn a declaration made over two hundred years ago we hold these truths to be self evident\nThat all men are created it [noise] but they aren't dug by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that\nThe truth genius of America\nThis is the story we tell ourselves with the first nation in the world not formed around an ethnic tribes our country was built on a revolutionary idea [noise]\nSpecially early on those first laws that basically said this is a white man's country lots of the founding fathers owned people and they said all men were created equal except those who were three fifths of a person\nAnd deception to take this land from the Native Americans and yes it was all men are created equal and women didn't even get to vote for almost a hundred and fifty years [noise] but that's how the world was back then\nLook how far we've come at founding idea was genius and we've been working things out ever since striding relentlessly toward that Jeffersonian ideal\nThat our story and we're sticking to apparently\nBut how true is that [noise]\nOf course right at the start one man embodied the national contradiction almost ridiculously well all by himself\nWe know Thomas Jefferson wrote the declaration and own people but\nIt turns out it's deeper than that [noise]\nHe had Jefferson was this accent is an Anglo saxon is the thing I didn't know until I started my research\nNow Irvin Painter the Princeton history professor America\nShe studied Jefferson's lesser known writings in which he stole our Saxon ancestors\nThe notion of the Anglo saxon people is more popular in America than anywhere else painter says it refers to the English more or less but includes other northern Europeans who migrated to Britain before the ... century\nPainter says the British themselves don't use the term much and it's almost never heard in the supposed original homeland of the Saxons\nThis sort of ... their world uh between the Netherlands and in Denmark kind of been there or a ... in Germany they don't use those words they don't use Anglo saxon\nJefferson dead at the continental Congress of Seventeen Seventy six the very moment when the founders were adopting his stirring declaration\nJefferson proposed including in the great seal of the United states images of anger and horse or they were the Saxon chiefs from ... we said claimed the honor of being descended we seems Jefferson was comfortable defining the United states\nAs a Saxon country the proposal was not approved Nell painter says ...\nWe're romanticized and just ...\nHe has some strange ideas about British history in which the Romans leave no impressed [laughter] not only on the the British population but also among the language and then the Normans

Jennifer dumb\n\nEach week on the science radio show and podcast big picture science\nHost sets us back in Mali badly connect ideas about the origin future and behavior of life in technology and surprising and playful ways\nAstrobiologist David ... who makes the case for life on Venus starting with why it probably doesn't exist on the surface in Fahrenheit terms it's close to nine hundred degrees\nEvery day all day day night\nNorth south the only way you can get a little bit cooler than that on Venus is to go up to the top of one of the high mountains but that that doesn't buy you much it's it's pretty darn hot everywhere on being us on the surface okay so even aside from ...\nLack of water no oceans know rivers no legs the fact that the atmosphere is all this carbon dioxide and so what you need aside from all that it looks like it's dead Jim me because any life would just be boiled away but you have another idea\nWell I think first of all and astrobiology we have to really keep a pretty open mind about\nThe question of habit ability because\nOur notions are so heavily biased towards our one planet so we have to be open to ideas that seemed like there are a little bit out of left field as as long as they're not so far out that that we're we're just a chasing fairy tales but an interesting thing about Venus is that it has this cloud deck\nAbout thirty miles up from the surface that is composed of liquid water granted liquid water in an intense acidic solution but yet there is a liquid medium and there are other properties of that card deck that just conceivably I think could be conducive to life\nSo what you're suggesting is that Venus could have some sort of floating organisms\n[noise] yeah I don't see any reason why there couldn't be something analogous to bacteria that could live in ... droplets on Venus there's liquid medium their energy sources there seemed to be nutrients and there are even some strange chemical\nProperties of that region of the atmosphere that could be interpreted as somewhat conducive to some kind of life\nSo these are not big birds these are not atmosphere elephants these would be microbes\nFloating thirty miles up into the ... atmosphere now you say there is some interesting compounds up there but really how did these guys make a living I mean are they doing it by a photosynthesis or they just eating chemicals in the atmosphere ... what what makes them tick what's their metabolism\nWhether a couple of possibilities photosynthesis is a possibility there is actually a fair amount of solar radiation up in the ... in fact if there was something up there that could take advantage of ultraviolet light\nNot a trick that we've seen on earth but a trick one might imagine that live somewhere in the universe could have mastered then there's quite a bit of energy the other possibility is that they are taking in some kind of chemical energy\nThere are some interesting cycles in the atmosphere Venus involving volcanoes on the surface and sulfur gases in the atmosphere and transitions between energetic molecules and what will be called ... equilibrium where there is sort of\nEnergetic potential in the mix of chemicals and those are the kinds of things\nAnd a job and if you don't look for the same specific metabolism that we have on earth but look for that general property of a chemical cycle that could be exploited by organisms than you actually can come up with some examples on Venus of juicy chemicals that you could imagine could be eaten and digested and used to extract energy by organisms\nWell as long as we're talking about the theoretical possibility of life there I'll ask you to speculate a little bit farther would this life have been descended from\nLife left over from those very early days of Venus when we think that it was a lot more like the earth when it might have had surface oceans and and these are the remnants of an ancient venues Asian population of biology\nI think it's possible when Venus whether young planet it probably had oceans and in fact there was probably a time when Venus earth and Mars all had oceans and may even have been exchanging life between them\nSo there could have been in origin of life on Venus Venus could have been infected if you will with microbes from earth or Mars so if our current understanding of what it takes for a biosphere is
