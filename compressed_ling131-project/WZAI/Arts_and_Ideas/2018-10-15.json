the chief academic officer for the public schools in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and a lot of kids in his schools were not reading well only fifty six percent of third graders were scoring proficient on the state reading test uh I didn't I didn't know what to do he knew nothing about how kids learn to read or how reading should be taught\nBut he did know that even some older students were struggling with pretty basic stuff when it came to reading\nI was in middle school and high school teacher for many years and I could see students who had difficulty with breaking down individual words\nThey come across a word they'd never seen before and have no idea how to sound it out Kim harbor noticed the same thing she was a high school English teacher in Bethlehem and she says a disturbing number of her students or not very good readers even students in honors classes\nDidn't like to read they avoided reading they would tell me it was too hard\nKind of shrugged it off I think it became easy to say well that's just the way it is and you're always going to have X percent of kids who was just going to be a a struggle for less than sixty percent of kids reading professionally\nIt wasn't shocking [noise] it's just the way things were\nIt was always well that's not a reflection of Bethlehem that's a portion of us\nMike ... is president of the Bethlehem school board\nWill you know those kids are parents aren't around or maybe they don't have to parents or one pair tomato a grandmother and that's the best way to do\nIt's true that the districts poorer schools had the worst reading scores\nThere are lots of low income families here but there are a fancy homes here too and when she's academic officer jak sales I was examining the reading scores he saw there were plenty of kids at the wealthier schools not reading very well either this was not just poverty since he knew nothing about reading he started searching online\nThere's a whole lot of research about how kids learn to read there are thousands of studies this\nIs Luis ... she's been teaching in researching reading since the Nineteen seventies this is the most studied aspect of human learning one of the many things researchers have learned over the years is that virtually all kids can learn to read\nResearchers have done studies in classrooms and in clinics and they've shown over and over that somewhere between one and six percent of kids have such severe learning disabilities that they will probably always struggle with reading but everyone else can learn to read if they are taught [noise]\nThe problem is lots of kids aren't being taught at least not in ways that line up with what science says about how children learn to read\nThe result more than six intend fourth graders and the United states are not proficient readers thirty million adults struggle to read a basic passage of text and this is not just a poverty problem one third of struggling readers are from college educated families\nIn the nation\nA PM reports this is hard words why aren't are kids being taught to read [noise] kids who struggled to read are more likely to drop out of high school they're more likely to end up in the criminal justice system they're more likely to live in poverty when they grow up [noise]\nInstead the theory goes when readers comfortable where they don't know they use context to figure out what the word is so if a child gets stuck on a word she's told\nRe read the sentence think about a word that would make sense and the sentence look at the pictures she's told that's what good readers do but in fact that's not what good readers do studies that compare skilled readers to pour readers show that poor readers gas when they come to a word they don't know\nBecause they have difficulty decoding\nWhen skilled readers control where they don't know they rapidly identify the sounds and letters in the word good readers may guess at the meeting\nThe print on the page [noise] we're going back to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania now where balance literacy with the prevailing approach to reading instructions until the district got serious about trying to do something about all those kids who are struggling with reading\nThis is Cathy that she's walking the halls of calypso elementary where she's the principal back in twenty Fifteen\nWouldn't Bethlehem realized it needed to change the way it's taught reading district leaders decided the first step would be a series of trainings for all the principles of the district sixteen elementary schools over the course of an entire school year the principles we're going to be taught the reading science\nAs it happened Kathy bashed without on medical leave when the trainings began but our colleagues warned her\nThey said to me Cathy we know you you're not going to take well to this training\nThe principles we're learning about the importance of explicitly teaching children how to decode words and everyone was sure ... was going to resist\nThey knew who I was and how reading with a passion and the decoding was never part of anything I ever did but ... had a secret [noise]\nEven though she was known as the districts number one balance literacy champion\nShe had that before becoming a principal ... have been a reading specialist it was her job to help struggling readers in her training to become a reading specialist she says she learned a lot about how to identify\nA child with a reading problem but she learned nothing about how to help a child actually learn to read I didn't know what to do\nExcept to give them more book\nAnd it wasn't working with time on our hands while she was on medical leave taffy bass to begin reading about reading and she discovered the vast scientific literature\nWhen she returned to work for medical even joined her fellow principles and the trainings on the reading science she was ready to hear what the trainer had to say and it kind of blew her mind while we do cave\nLet's go get at this\nThe training of principles we're doing used curriculum written by Lewis ... you've heard her earlier the curriculum is called language essential for teachers of reading and spelling or letters for short\nThe principles went through the training and twenty Fifteen the kindergarten teachers went through it the next year than the districts first and second grade teachers did the training I got\nEveryone training was led by Mary Jo ... she's an educational consultant which word doesn't begin with the same sound theory\nTherefore for children's it clearly understand how letters represent speech sounds they need to be able to hear the speech sounds and teachers do too it's\nNot always easy to tell me the first time you hear\nIn unit [noise]\nYes [noise] yes before you get to the ... how about Charlotte [noise]\nOnce kids can isolate the sounds in a word there next task is to understand how letters represent those signs in English we have forty four different speech sounds or phonemes each phone him is represented by a letter or combinations of letters\nResearch shows when kids are explicitly taught how letters represent phonemes they become better readers [noise]\nBut phonics isn't enough kids can learn to decode words without knowing what the words mean to comprehend what they're reading kids need a good vocabulary to scientists came up with a model to explain the relationship between a person's ability to decode tax\nAnd their ability to comprehend what they're reading [noise]\nScientists called it the simple view of reading and it's basically a math formula it says this reading comprehension\nEquals the coding skills times language comprehension\nLanguage comprehension is what develops naturally in children when people talk to them it's just like the ... case for deep coating is what kids have to be taught for [noise]\nSome kids learn decoding quickly and easily others need much more instruction but a child who can't decode will never be a good reader because of that math formula\nZero times anything is zero [noise]\nAnd their training on the science of reading the teachers and principals in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania learned about the simple view of reading and a lot more there's quite a bit to know about the structure of the English language to be able to teach it to little kids\nI sat down with three teachers who are in the first group to go through the training in Bethlehem I asked them what it was like at first\nI remember sitting there and like my head was dropping 'cause it was like how can I take all of this in oh my God I'm never going to be able to use or I don't know how to use this and then them constantly saying you're going to get there you're going to get there you are going to get there\nThat was Adrian ... and ...\nTeacher preparation programs neither had teacher Michelle both act\nIt was very broad classes vague classes and like a children's literature class but not actually teaching phonics and things like that\nWhen they became teachers they did a little of what they thought was phonics candy mold and NATO says it pretty much went like this\nSo like we did like a letter a week so if the letter was a we read books about a week things with a we found things with a and then but we never did anything else with it like we all we did was learned like a said act and then there's apples and we take that Apple's\nWhen you were all being taught to use that way and teaching that way what was the idea\nAbout how children learn to read did you have a sense of that [laughter] no I now that I think about it no not really it was just that they do [laughter] almost like it's automatic yeah\nWhen these teachers started the training on the science of reading they felt overwhelmed by the time they were done they felt guilty I thought all these years all these students I feel horrible guilt the Bethlehem school district has adopted a motto to help ease the guilt when we know better we do better\nBack when I went to kindergarten class at Bethlehem calypso elementary school this is Cathy vast school the principal everyone thought was going to resist the reading science but didn't her kindergarten teachers got the science of reading training last year now they're putting it into practice global\nCutting the sound off guys the entire class is seated on a carpet while a student teacher holds up flash cards with pictures on them no letters the kids are just practicing the first sounds and words to begin with ... and ... water\n\nTeachers in Bethlehem use a curriculum that mixes whole class lessons like this one with group work it's tailored to the needs of kids at different points in the process of learning to read after the class lesson teacher Lynn ... meets with a group of six students at a small U shaped table\nAnd we're going to start doing something today that we have not done before this is brand spanking\nAll right this group of kindergartners is ready for something more challenging than words to begin with ... and ...\nSo let's read it together what to say I had\nThree court wonderful these kids are writing a report about a pet\nThings their pet can do

have a single child in my room that has that look on their face like I Can't do that is\nKelly Butler and her colleagues at the bark still reading Institute went to state education officials and said you have to do something about this and in two thousand three\nIn a rather extraordinary move the state department of education mandated that every teacher preparation program in Mississippi require two courses on early literacy to cover what was in the national reading panel report [noise]\nIt was extraordinary because even though states have the authority to regulate teacher preparation programs they rarely tell them what to teach in their classes\nHigher education does not like to be told what to do this is Kelly Butler again\nProfessors pretty much have academic freedom to construct learning in the way they think best\nFaculty members close the door and do whatever the heck they want to\nThat's Angela Rutherford she is a faculty member at the University of Mississippi she works with the bar so reading Institute she knows the reading science and she says a lot of her colleagues and teacher preparation programs don't they believe in whole language\nThat's what they believe I had a colleague challenge me and her question was well you know what do you believe I said I Believe what I see in research\nOnce when Kelly Butler was talking to a dean about the reading science the deans said to her is this your science or my science is this your science or my science\n[noise] that's what Kelly Butler\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming so standing member visit Cape and islands dot org\nWhich well fast forward to twenty Fifteen and we now have livers he dies prevention act\nThe state legislature had passed a law called the literacy based promotion act the law says that kids who are not reading on grade level by the end of third grade cannot move on to fourth grade\nWhat that precipitated was retraining of teachers because we knew that teachers really didn't know enough about what to do\nThe teachers already working in Mississippi schools started learning\nThe reading science but what about the new teachers just graduating from teacher prep program if they weren't learning the science the state would be spending money forever training teachers at this point no one really knew what aspiring teachers were actually learning and those required early literacy classes\nSo and twenty Fifteen the bark still reading Institute decided to repeat this study had done back in two thousand three this time private colleges were included Fifteen teacher prep programs overall\nThe needle had news sun Kelly Butler says with one exception [noise] all the states teacher prep programs\nWhere now teaching the five components of reading the deans and faculty all said they'd heard of the national reading panel report but most of them had not read it she learned to other things that shocked her when I interviewed both faculty\nAnd students and asked them particular questions about the science of reading for example were they familiar with something called the simple view of reading\nThat's that formula scientists came up with to explain that reading comprehension is a product of your ability to decode taxed times all the words you know the meaning of\nNot a single one that I talked to had ever heard of the simple view of reading which has been around since Nineteen eighty six [noise] and\nThe science had been around for a long time\nState had been requiring colleges to teach the science for more than a decade and still prospective teachers weren't learning it [noise]\nSo the state legislature decided to do something else it started requiring teacher candidates to pass a test on the reading science if you don't pass the foundations of reading test you don't get license\nTo teach elementary school in Mississippi [noise]\n... [noise] yeah\nWere backing letters training\nThey're in Paris now working on funny Mick awareness skills this is ... hairs Alan ... and you heard them earlier\nWhat is the beach\n[laughter]\nCollege faculty and Mississippi are not required to do letters training but it's in the best interests of those who teach the early literacy classes since their students will not become license teachers unless they passed the foundations of reading test\nI interviewed several of the women in his training they were all women I was expecting to hear resistance and resignation about being here but I didn't\nAs I'm sitting in there I'm thinking I'm gonna do this and classics weaker oh man I Wish I'd done I don't have to make a note you know to do this next semester\nThat was Kim Smith of Mississippi State and this is Barbara Bolling of the University of southern Mississippi\nI feel I'm blessed to be part of this change\nThey were elementary school teachers before they became college instructors they didn't know the reading science when they were teachers and they're grateful to be learning it now\nI think that we all agree that this is right\nOr the best practices and maybe we're here because of that and the whole language ones are not here because I think they would really rude resists\nThe faculty who believe in whole language didn't seem to be here I had to look for them I found two professors at the University of southern Mississippi willing to talk to me ah\nMy name is Stacy read I Am an associate professor of literacy and other areas of elementary and\nI'm Mary aerial I'm a professor in the department of curriculum instruction special education\nMary aerial had actually been the chair of the department until a few months before our interview she in Stacy read both told me they had no interest in going to the letters training this is Stacey reads I M philosophically opposed\nTo jumping on the bandwagon of the next great thing that's going to teach every child how to learn to read phonics for me is not that answer\nShe says she knows this from her own experience she was in elementary school teacher before she got her PHD it was the early Nineteen nineties her students did phonics worksheets and then got these little books called Dakota will readers that contained words with the letter patterns they'd been ...\nThe bad rap hid in the tin can they were boring [laughter] for repetitive that as soon as I sat down with my first graders and read a book\nLike crawling into their friends they were instantly engaged in story she says she ditched the phonics work books and the Dakota will readers and once I started teaching in a more whole way more encompassing way of the whole child what does this child need what does that child and eat let's read more real\nBook Whistler right more real language about your life once they did that my teaching improve the students learn more I feel I feel they cannot the other side much better\nStacy ... says for students seemed more engaged but she admits she had no evidence they were learning better [noise]\nOne of the central tenets of the whole language movement is that teachers are best able to judge whether their students are learning not standardized tests\nAnother key idea is that all children learn differently and need to be taught in different ways but that's not true with reading\nOur brains are much more similar than they are different and we all need to learn the same things to change our non reading brains into reading brains\nSome of us learned to read more quickly and easily than others but every one reads and basically the same way one of the most consistent findings in all of education research is that children become better readers when they get explicit and systematic phonics instruction\nDakota readers would let her patterns maybe boring and repetitive for adults but they help children learn to read\nMary aerial the former chair of the curriculum and special ed department at the University of southern Mississippi remains unconvinced she's against explicit phonics instruction\nShe thinks it can be helpful to do some phonics with kids as they're reading books maybe prompt them to sound something out to notice a letter pattern in a word but she thinks kids will be distracted from understanding the meaning of what they're reading if teachers focus too much on how words are made up of letters\nWould it really does it makes it harder because we're trying to make meaning of it and when you you're teaching these meaningless symbols than it is actually making it harder for breaking it down into pieces makes it harder makes it harder to learn to read\nThat's the idea that's one of the the ideas of concepts behind her language is that it's that's when it's meaningful it's easy\nIt makes it harder so okay so so from your perspective how do kids learn to read [noise] well I think kids learn to read in different ways um a lot of children come to school already reading because they had been immersed in print rich environments from the time they were born\nThe underlying belief here is the reading comes naturally when children are read to end surrounded by books Mary aerial sees the effort to change reading instruction in Mississippi as an example of lawmakers telling educators what to do and she doesn't like it\nShe actually left her job shortly after our interview in part because of her frustration over what's happening with reading and Mississippi [noise] she told me she does not like the term science\nGo spend

E. you know in in putative us partners have shut down either about messaging or pro democracy programs over the years\nIt's always a delicate balance and at least in normal times those governments understand that part of the deal with having a relationship with the U.S is that they're going to support anti extremist pro democracy programs have different sorts and\nUm I think what his story shows is when you leave that value proposition of and partnering with the authorities to challenge extremism in the society and you start talking about challenging the authorities themselves it's unsustainable within the ...\nI guess how\nHow much um authenticity will you have\nIf you can't criticize the ruling elite with the viewers I mean what they see that you're just basically an arm of the corrupt leadership\nThat is definitely one of the trade offs um and so your popularity is inextricably linked to the popularity of the ruler [noise]\nUh we do have some examples of autocrats who are popular right now with young people but certainly there are those who are extremely unpopular\nSo that that is the central trade off if you want to work within the territory of the autocracy is fun the other hand you go to the root of the Iraqi John Stewart and you start broadcasting from Germany you risk another type of challenge to your authenticity witches have working for the German government\nSo it's six of one half a dozen of the other and people adjust according to their own comfort levels and preferences\n[noise] so how can you measure whether or not all of this is working to create change positive change [noise]\nDoing so is especially difficult in environments where focus groups and opinion surveys are\nLess effective uh because of concerns about expressing your own opinion you can sometimes gain insight into a programs impact from the backlash it stirs overtime so for example there was a long running comedy in Saudi Arabia called Taj moustache\n[laughter]\nOn\nThe beginning uh it was very easy for them to get censored\nBy the government or get death threats from extremists in the society overtime script that were once rejected by sensors became acceptable and extremists took\nGreater and greater pushing in order to ... to be provoked into threatening so that's evidence on the one hand the government is becoming more accepting of gutsy\nShows and on the other hand that extremists are getting a culture rated to challenges from liberals [noise]\n\nJust the ...

Omar took issue with the way his face was represented\n\nYou're listening to fighting extremism on Middle East media on America abroad I'm Madeleine Brand on today's program we're talking about how more liberal media in the Arab world can be a counterbalance to radical messaging\nSome of the most well known religious figures in the middle east right now are all do a elder dude or the new preachers since the Arab Spring in twenty eleven they've become popular on TV and some Middle Eastern countries\nMany people looked at them for guidance on how to think about religion and politics the new preachers are advocating what they call a revolution of south meaning people should have a strong inner sense of their religion that doesn't rely on rituals are rules\nYou asked me mole is a professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan and she studied the rise of these new religious figures\nI became interested in Islam make TV preaching when I saw the growing popularity of very young creatures with 'em no kind of traditional religious education with most of the viewers in Egypt\nWere very invested in changing what Islamic media sounds and looks like so they they felt that traditional Islamic media was very boring very conventional\nWho use those to lose a limb or you lose you\nKnow one wanted to listen to men in bushy beards yell about all the different ways they're going to go to hell\nFor those some of those reviews they would have refused disobeyed on law and his message that's as good as complete justice\nAnd they felt that what was needed with a new kind of a stomach media that spoke to you in in in ways that they were familiar with from watching a reality shows are music videos or Hollywood entertainment\nSo I became interested in how these creatures were trying to re imagine what Islamic media sounds and looks like [noise]\nOne of the first major events where these new preachers began to show their influence was during the Egyptian revolution in twenty eleven\nDuring the actual Eighteen days of the uprising against Mubarak most people were not interested in watching the sonic television pictures they were very interested in watching BBC ... uh CNN and watching news coverage of the revolution\nBut immediately after Mubarak resigned people began to look to find me television preachers to offer them kind of commentary or solutions to the many political problems and economic problems that Egypt was facing\nSo it was interesting to see was how the Islamic television preachers I was working with began to re imagined their role as kind of social critics or as people who would offer\nVarious kinds of solutions to the different problems facing Egypt and the immediate aftermath of the revolution [noise]\nSo my ... is a very important to stomach media figure he is a thirty something preacher who is currently pursuing a PHD at Cambridge University in the u._k.\nAn over the past years Masood has really been pushing the boundaries of what Islamic media or Islamic television preaching looks and sounds like [noise]\nWas right after the revolution\nW ... standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nPull who was kind of live up to the promise of revolutionary Egypt in terms of democracy and coexistence intolerance and uh and civil disagreements\nAnd he did that through our religious idiom for most Muslims the solution to political and economic problems lies in a more correct understanding of what the Islamic tradition teaches and upholds\nSo when you tune into his YouTube channel you're going to find him singing with a guitar with one of Egypt ... most famous revolutionary artists and he's going to be singing a song against a dogmatic thinking weather from a religious people or a non religious people [noise]\n...\nYou're going to find him starring in a TV drama series that also has a religious message to impart over thirty episode\nThe stricken ... live off of on the moon beautiful ...\nSo those are the kinds of a new format that him and other creatures like him are really innovating in their attempt to reach new audiences to reach a young Muslims in ways that they will actually find compelling\nBut ... is just one of many prominent figures in the middle east right now and they don't all share the same ideas\nPrecisely because the Islamic television sector is largely privately owned and privately funded there exists a wide spectrum of theological an ideological orientations on Islamic television\nIslamic television is not a model is there's a wide diversity of viewpoints and religious scholarship that is regularly aired when we think about extremism we also have to think about it's opposite which is moderation\nAnd the idea of of religious moderation has a very long history within the Muslim world including in the pre modern era\nBut what moderation means and what voices get labeled as extremist is is not a stable thing it's it's constantly changing\nBut one thing is clear is that today for the vast majority of Muslims ISIS is an extremist group or in the sense that it's norms and practices are beyond the pale of what a most Muslims would agree their religion teaches and so when it comes to efforts to combat ISIS you're going to see a lot of cooperation\nLong and Islamic television preachers see themselves as having a very important role in this regard or because they see their main role as teaching Muslims what Islam really means or what it really entails\nBut most says combating violent ideologies isn't always a huge priority for these creatures she says that's because relatively few people are actually recruited to join ISIS\nThere's been a lot of panic lately about the recruitment success of ISIS among young Muslims but if you look at the numbers you realize this is really an unfounded panic even Tunisia which has sent the most young people to ISIS as of last year it sent six thousand people\nNow Tunisia's population is twelve million\nAnd you can begin to to put the number of six thousand in perspective and that's the biggest the biggest so sort of a country that has sent young people to ISIS and I think that the biggest counter narrative two groups like ISIS and their extremism actually comes from the reality that the vast majority of ISIS victims have been other Muslims\nAre not just Shiite Muslims but actually Sunni Muslims\nIn the U.S um we tend to focus on ISIS attacks in western countries but ISIS has mostly been very active in Middle Eastern countries in November last year ISIS carried out one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Egyptian history where basically killed three hundred people praying in a mosque\nIn a town of only seven hundred\nPeople [laughter]\nSo why some half the population of of of this village to the biggest victims of terrorism committed by Muslims are actually other Muslims\nAnd so I think what we need is less religious counter narratives because those are alive and well a more of a treatment of the context that allow violent ideologies and the allergies to flourish and this would mean addressing structural problems like\nEconomic inequality political corruption as well as the human devastation brought by western military intervention in the region\nAnd I think you know us as American citizens we have an opportunity to hold our government accountable for the ways in which is policies un actions in the middle east have actually created a breeding ground for groups like ISIS\n[laughter]\n... he's a professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan [noise]\nIt's obvious that the media landscape in the middle east is vast and that means that for an outsider it's really hard to understand us has tried to harness the power of the media there in order to promote its own interests but there are things us policymakers just don't get about how religious and political issues on line in the middle east\nThat's according to Nathan Brown he's a professor of political science at George Washington university\nWhat the United States is concerned about is often immediate security goals and it might be having to do with the the Israeli Palestinian conflict there might have to do with Syria might have to do with Yemen\nSo what we will sometimes do is come in to say okay this person is with us on Palestinian issue with this government is with us on Yemen and therefore it sort of back them
