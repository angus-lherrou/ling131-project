I I Can't go back in my room there's there's something terrible there and she looked at me and you know she was used to me coming downstairs all the time you know ever since I got my own ... things in shadows and stuff like that\n[noise] um but I knew this was different and uh she she didn't and she just said Adrian I can't possibly deal with this right now you need to go back to bed\nAnd I said no no mom this is this is real there's there's something in my room right now\nAnd uh she was like no you go back to bed you know I I don't have time she said take the cat and ah\nOur cat was ... it was a pretty big cat when whenever I held him stretched out he or she was about half my height and a very large fat cat he tended to bite if you annoyed him for too long\nBut so that was\nThat struck me as really the only option and uh you know you're around that age you don't really think to contradict your parents\nIt's just like oh wow I have to go back into that room [noise] All right so uh I went and I I grab the cat\nLiterally dragged him up the stairs is a huge cat that was a little girl back up this dark staircase and back into my room\nIt it consisted mostly of this kind of eerie [noise]\nIt looks like a skeleton\nHad these deep dark holes fries [noise]\nShort sticking up hairs on its head\nI could see all of the uh like cracks in peace\nAnd have these long spindly ours [noise]\nAnd they put them back on by the next morning this week returned my mom tried spraying\nThe hitters every day with WD forty right before she opened it then right before she closed it after two cans she gave a\nBoat\nAnd they forget all about the challenge for months or years they started it back up one day I discovered graphite powder or mom sauna infomercial for ... finally they retired moved to Florida and sold the house to me my wife have on and I went after the problem with gusto I knew better but she was my new bride and I wanted her to be happy\n[noise] my parents and I recall the cupboard helped me for years ...\nWhere's the spare bottle of ketchup helped me\nI'd gotten used to this week it was part of the family you have on and said I had to do the laundry for the week if she found a solution first\nWe tried all the normal method soil Crisco Greece she thought petroleum jelly would work and one time try why jelly\nWe asked an antique shop to see if they have similar hinges we wanted to replace them but we love the way they looked no one had ever seen such a design long fingers of metal stretching around the doors if a bony hand holding it turning up the rest that offer to buy them from us if we wanted so and for a good look some\nEventually we did evolve and tired of helped me it was creepy she said like a voice will regret not helping\nWe bought modern hinges and re hung the old old pantry door\nFrom them helped me was backed by supper\n\nThe next day we ordered a new door it was the way to the door and my father assured me over a phone call from Florida the way to the door causes quakes replacement we measured the pantry interest and I had a would cut her cut a new door at of cherry there was a beautiful or Avon gasped when she saw it\nThe price we pay for the antique hinges cover the cost of the new door and we put it up the confidence to finally solving the problem\nBut others said we talked out that the squeak was a challenge I went to bed when Reid if I'd miss the sound I prayed to God that night to thank him for making my life so easy that I could miss the sound of my pantry door squeaking\nBy morning it was back helped me\n\nEven begin to get nervous so it was it was too weird she said it was only a squeak I said no to cry for help she said have laughed until there was not a cry for help\nBut maybe you thinking it was a cry for help is a cry for help she demanded we bring in a contractor to see if we could show up the door for him it was a heavy door moving the within the frame around it didn't work the stars above the floor contractor tapped around and said\nHey it is the floor he pulled up a couple of boards and right in the center of the pantry was a whole he shined his flashlight down and said hey there's another whole I went and got my ladder because a contractor didn't have his with him\nWe shoved down the hall and we both climbed to the contractor and me if I wouldn't go near it she said she didn't want to know what was down there in the helped me all the first from the contractor called the chamber was empty circular and made of stone the walls\nDungeon rough and block the there were no corners and it reminded me of a medieval tour it\nSeen one room was enough for me I Would have to let her called my dad said he knew nothing about it that he cut short our conversation and said he had to ... time to make the contractor continued into the next soul and it turns out into another\nThere were three chambers at all the first stone the second a polished in late stone and a third of the lowest what\nBig old chunks of timber should the contractor beans across the top planks at the bottom the sand and warn with you ...\nHe tried to dig up the floor of the third chamber but didn't find it easy way to prop up the boards and didn't want to damage the beautiful wood working\nIn this third chamber he said there were scratches on the wall scratches everywhere stretchers that formed words but not where she'd seen before he described it all to me over a coke factory came out of the whole but he had this slightly deranged look about him when I invited him to go back down to the stronger light he said he had to\nBe going and walked up to his truck and drove away he left behind his bucket of tools and never return for the [noise]\nAh\nAfter that day and helped me was joined by ... [noise] it was fated for [noise] by the time I understood that I was hearing knocking I realize that have been going on for a long time\nBut it had been so faith that it didn't break all the way to my conscious mind the knocking grew louder and we need to know if we had help me and not not living with us we made up jokes during the day\nBut at night we'd be frightened sometimes thinking what if it's not the furnace at night knock knock didn't see much like a joke at all [noise]\n\nThe knocking pushed my curiosity over my fear my wife's that we should pour a truckload of cement down the whole be done but I wanted to visit that third chamber it took more courage than I had so we invite a bunch of friends over for a party and I went down\nI wanted to have a house full of fun loving guess because it seemed like nothing bad happens is a houseful of people having fun I found with a contractor headphones and something he had not\nI've found a book\nWas in the third chamber inspecting the writing on the wall it was very quiet sixty or Seventy feet below my house I couldn't hear the minor party going on overhead I could have my own breathing my headline palm I startled several times at the side of my own feet shuffling on the floor\nThe writing the contract to describe per scratches ... deep into the wood and some shallower ones on top turned to rub off the deep scars the deeper scratches dance you really do the right to left me the light of my head might have to cast shadows that moved when I moved\nSometimes the scratches came together and strange forms none were an English words but they were beautifully spelled I looked around for utensils something do scratch with a stick bone chipper rock\nI looked down at my feet I found a book I was nearly standing on it I had not missed it before I'm not stupid\nThere was no book in there when I first arrived I had dropped off a ladder inspected the walls she leaning floor I didn't want to be surprised by something the spider rat or\nIt was when I looked to my wife and party yesterday I found a book that the knocking resumed and with them [noise] it came from just on the other side of the wall right next to me\nI stuffed the book into my waist banded frantically set to climb up the ladder to the second chamber the knocking chased when I got to the second chamber the hollow wrapping on would turn to a vacant happiness stone [noise]\nI had just the one ladder to the bottom you drop the ladder down then climbed down then drop it into the next four climbed down and do it to get out you have to do with the reverse it took a long time [noise]\nI almost drop the ladder pointed out of the third chamber and it collapsed once as I climbed up into the first chamber I fell hard it was momentarily pinned against the stonewall the tapping was in my ear and I could hear help me which I had no intention of doing [noise]\nFinally after several more missed starts I made it to the top pulled off a ladder handover hand and at an angle so to get it out the pantry door but not to scratch enamel in the refrigerator I looked around for my friends to tell them what I found that nobody was around\nClasses and bottles scattered like a bomb went off in the driveway was empty safe for two cars that seem to have collided during the get away their bumpers were stuck together and their cars abandoned by their owners [noise]\nEven ... I was anxious to read the book I found so I sat at the kitchen table and read the first\nI should have stopped there the book was leather bound hand written in the paper was thick and rough ... of some sort of income some pages and smears on others half of the pages were empty and only half of those were legible I thought it might be where some big money so the Saturday morning after I finished it I dropped it into a zip lock freezer bag and drove down to an antique bookstore to wrestle\nThe passenger seat right next to me but when I arrived at the store it was gone I searched everywhere and finally just went home thinking that maybe a distracted on the driveway when I got home I searched high and low and finally discovered it on my wife's night stand where I had left her and hour before sleeping in after a long week\nShe wasn't there I Lived all over the house and then in the whole because I knew what that book says\nHi called offer Herbert heard nothing in return I dropped the ladder into the first chamber crawl down and looked into the second nothing [noise] I was too scared to drop into the second or third chamber so I started back up the ladder time to call the police that's when the phone rang [noise]\nIt was tense sudden ringing startled me\nI felt from the ladder and through to the second hold down to the second chamber [noise] I don't remember picking it up but I held the book in Miami much to my chest instead of revenues letter the second chambers about twice by with polished stone walls\nTo slip into far apart decline blood remain above and the first chamber I could see the light from that chamber the one with a lot or just below the whole of the pantry I hadn't had time to grab my head lab during the desperate search for my wife\nI have already read the book and I know what it says about the second chamber and the third chamber right below me\nI Can't see into the third chamber it is too dark I'm fearful of the sounds the book describes prey to hear the phone the doorbell if my wife returning home I just want to hear a normal sound the quietest quite clear\nSo we\nWent back towards the elevator elevator straight ahead to the right was a [noise]\nThe best way to describe it about six feet above the ground and it was probably about three foot by three foot square [noise]\nAnd there were steam pipes that ran through they ran over your head and it took a turn went through this\nSo he says well this is the only tunnel I Know of and says I don't know where it goes never\nGotten very deep and it's it's just a passage way so we we walked up towards it and I found as ... or something stand on\nStood up and that was peering into this tunnel and I it was weird because it was absolutely the dark as dark you've ever seen in your life like the the the black was consuming you could see\nJust a little bit of steam pipe and I know of course pull my phone out China flashlight and their shining that flash down there you could see more black and about three mortgages esteem pipe and that was it you know the one\nWas was really kind of strange is that the basement although it was on the in the basement level it was very very warm does the steam pipes running above your head so you can feel the heat radiating off of that\nBut in that little corner it was just absolutely ice cold and the difference in the space of about two and a half feet it went from you feeling the heat\nTo it like you were standing outside and it was snowing real good\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands die to work this noise [noise]\nVery loud it was very close by\nAll three of us kind of\nRolled around to look and see where it was coming from well that noise was coming from the elevator which was next to us it was some sort of like I I guess that's the fire alarm\nThere's a fire courting at on rolls over the opening of the elevator and remember the doors were stuck open this fire curtain on ruled that sells down towards the floor [noise]\nAnd of course you know we're looking to what the hell is that and well we're watching this it rolls itself about half way up and then rolls halfway down and the rules back halfway up and then the doors this whole time are opening closing opening closing [noise]\nSo I tell ya every hair on my head was standing straight up I I had never had a feeling like this before\nOr since then to add to it and all remember all the time is just ... going off and it sounds kind of a knee making it will get stronger to the doors are opening and closing the certain rolling itself up and down Albert walks over there and there's a release button on the curtain he pushes it and\nNothing happens it just keeps kind of doing its thing then there's a emergency light\nAbove where the elevator doors\nThat comes on and the rest of the life in\nThe basement\n... they don't go completely out but they do almost all the way to nothing so here's this emergency let all of a sudden we're in the bright brilliant light\nAnd I remember looking towards the ceiling and just seeing my breath that's that's all I can concentrate on my breath is coming out and overlooks he goes much calmer than I was ... was he was like maybe we should have back upstairs so\nHead towards the um [noise]\nThe elevator and the fire and still down he goes well let's let's take the stairs and I tell you the three of us were moving pretty quickly towards the staircase left side and Phil through his entire weight\nTowards that door and that door I remember it must\nHave been hilarious from the other side door burst open there's all these people standing around at the\nJust kind of looking at us and we kind of you\nKnow ... like cool like will rush off its okay you're All right\nWould thanks for the future we're going to leave now and I tell you I was really wound up the whole drive home of what that that was really weird that's something I Can't\nExplain and I really feel sorry for the poor guy who had to you know clean everything up and take over tables and chairs down into the

thought oh this person's dress up for Halloween because he was around who was like October ... issue you know and\nAnd I went through the curtain to go out to the front and when was there and then

area on at the time said that she thought that that and he was definitely demonic that it was very hostile and very angry and that it wanted to hurt people [noise]\n\nOne of the um first things I

basement of seat Melissa's to surpass but it's keep didn't know there are a lot of boost down they're weird just empty boosts with\nYou know old chairs and it's very creepy but when I was down there when I first started working I felt like just a presence of I don't know how to describe it but feminine presidents\nAnd I felt like I was in a room full of you know girls and I was like oh hey this is kind of interesting and and then second time when I went down there to kind of organized things I felt someone touch my earring [noise]\nAnd it really freaked me out for that kind of of calm at the same time\nBut it literally felt like someone had touched my earring and it kind of brought tears to my eyes feels like\nWhoever down here like do they like my my earrings and come to find out my boss Carolyn told me that actually it's not documented but they think that there were a lot of women\nWho were down there who servicemen [noise] we don't know if you know maybe they had been killed or raped or whatnot but it was really it's really sad place to be because most of the employees that they are ... are women and so\nIt's kind of [laughter] it's kind of hard to go down there sometimes\nIt's the overcome with lots of sadness [noise]\nThat there is a feminine presence in this place and those women experience a lot of pain and now there are these women who are powerful and

feet of snow\nAt an age when lots of people retire Ted spent over Ninety five thousand dollars so far on the biggest and most ambitious project of his life and he's not even halfway done in fact the huge costs the boat is one reason some locals doubt Ted will ever finish it including the guy working at the gas station across the street\nOne time I went over and I said how many people are betting against this project and he laughed and said what is your kidding said all of them\nCatch ... is a replica of a scale scouts were nineteenth century cargo ships basically like barges but with sales touching building boats off and on for over forty years so his choice to build a scout was personal he wanted a boat that could do real work but he also wanted to vote that would be a real pleasure\nThose guys were beautiful sailboat so this is one of them you know very agile sea worthy kindly shallow draft could carry a big loan\nThat isn't building this cow for himself though he dreams about will become an outdoor adventure classroom for at risk kids even hopes to sail to the Carolinas with a student crew where the load up rice bring it back to the vineyard\nAnd sell it so now the new saw is that right [noise]\nBut there is a daunting amount of work to do before that happens in almost no money left to pay for it\nJust started a nonprofit to raise funds he estimates he needs about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars more to finish by describing his dream and a grant proposal isn't Ted strong suit Ted thing some potential donors are holding off until they're sure that vote will be finished\nOne wants to get involved with the nuts [laughter] to get involved with a fiasco but you know then showing up everyday and\nTears of showing up even if the money hasn't from the beginning had invited anyone interested in the boat to come work with him and says the boats just a couple of blocks from the ferry landing lots of visitors and volunteers have dropped in\nYou know some common there'll be five dollars and the\nAnd the donation box I was just come you know when they give their good wishes and thousands and thousands of people would come and hundreds of people at work on the boat\nBut most volunteers move on at the end of the summer\nTed's left alone to continue the work on the off season with just a few part-time volunteers to help the main year round volunteer for the last Eighteen months has been Wayne sweetie [noise]\nWhat are you a most admire or respect about\nThe guts to do this [laughter]\nOh sometimes it's overwhelming\nWhen you think about it how much work there is a much work we've gotten done and how much there is going to be done [noise]\nJoe's Big deal back from the boat and then you've got to carefully [noise] perfect just cut the curve in the ...\n[noise] no that's another big deal getting your friends [noise] we\nWrestle one frame in life [noise] and then said would say All right we've got Seventy nine more to go\nFast she says she was she frame it out and then\n[noise] oh boy [noise]\nThe list goes on of course added to it the owner of the lot where the boat sits once it gone Ted's arrange for a contractor to move the boat to an uncovered location down the street\nBut the decades and installed yet that's the equivalent of a roof on a house and with no protection from the weather Ted's work will be even harder so Ted box has little choice but to work on good days he loves it he's finishing the blocking on the front deck pushing hard to check off at least one goal a day to keep up\n\nSo when we got up there [noise] oh [noise] roping was because of monumental escape from the crown point Jay owned by just real well\nKnown what was the ...\nA guy that was on duty needs to go to ... points and with my

bought another engineer came on and he brought me home\nTo the next morning mother of a catch them and I came downstairs from I ... did you hear me come home just said no hard times come home\nFor

jail\n...\nYour\n\n[noise] [noise]\nPounds was about the pretty is a theater we hadn't Garrett\nAt that time well was ... was the head of the red carpet or the head nights carpet and the answer is that a lot of designs and the outside that Markey than it is not like a marquee was resemble the one for the call will bear to Batman fifty years ago and then the grand was right across the street in comparison to like\nYou know you would never driven a Volkswagen in the capital\nLiving here in Nineteen forty five and my wife and I used to go there on Sunday that can be that degree the church and he had to go to church so we could go to the bathroom\nAnd at that time in the short run\nAnd that was almost every some studies that cartoon told no we didn't see the cartoons much it's a palette that was more of the the better the movies showed that almost more like Roy Rogers but they didn't show a lot of God was I don't think it's about back in there and it was more of a love story the more the\nTheater that he would bring it dates for more than it would be just a dare come in and watch a movie it was all kind of like just a word that you're going to get your big movement going it\nWas a nice play yeah go and you feel comfortable here and it was it was a very nice place to attract even at that time back then it was pretty it shows in town\n\n\n\nSo when you go in these buildings like how'd you get in the front door and just hope they inviting people to walk inside right\nWell I Want to be careful how I raised this I don't go into any building basically that I Can't just walk in\nAs far as getting into the buildings in Gary Indiana [noise] I Would have to honestly\nSay that yeah most of them are wide open most of those buildings\nThere in such a state of disrepair that if there's not a window where a door there's almost\nGuaranteed to be a massive hall or some sort of other entrance we're basically just walking [noise]\n\nIt was a very bright day saw the first thing you do when you walk in is this just pitch black and even the flashlights and takes a while\nFor your eyes to adjust and I remember walking in and\nBasically standing at the stage side looking\nOut and as my eyes come into focus just massive hulk in\nYou know theater and looking from the stage angle look towards the seats and just realizing how how gigantic this place is\nHow gigantic and they just got it uh well I guess I've read to twenty five hundred to three thousand seeds of you know typical I guess of the large movie theaters of the day where they were just you know\nSingle balcony that would hold you know large amount of the uh the crowd and then the siege but the part that\nTo me that made it look even larger was that just about all the seats have been torn out so you're seeing this big open space we're\nWalking to a theater you got to see you know you're kind of a\nKind of breaks up everything but just seeing that and wondering you know where did everything go get a lot of them are there but a lot of 'em are gone\nCivil what kind of shape and stuff like that in well preserved or was it a\nA unfortunately that theater it's pretty much destroyed in my opinion there's very little\nPlaster work left the group has gaping holes in the last few times that I had been there the whole just seem to be getting larger and larger all the a wire framing for the plaster is bear basically and coming down on its own I went up to the\nBooths the balconies and it's really\nLike I said just beyond\nYou have to UCI sustaining members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nAnd possibly save some of the plaster work there is a spot in the front lobby where he'd come in and buy your ticket where there was actually a sizeable chunk of the plaster still there and seeing how the colors and how it was painted [noise]\nSome little just a fraction of what it would have looked like you know while it was still an operation even though it would have been towards the end and they might have done some cheesier type of repairs or paint jobs just trying to get an idea of what it what it looked like and what it would have been like to go there and you can see a show [noise]\n\nDid you take anything really didn't give or take the million uh no I didn't there's really nothing to take from the palace theatre the thing I noticed in areas\nThere's really nothing to take from enables building a tape and abandoned for so long that basically everything significance been taken effect a good example but there is a hotel actually that encompasses the outside of the theater\nI think the second and third story and because the theaters such a state of disrepair you can\nWalk through holes in the walls get into\nHotel side or apartment lakeside\nEvery single door and there's just dozens and dozens of apartments [noise] all the ... have been cut out I mean you could tell somebody went in there and start 'em all out bigger pieces of\nYou know mine stone carving or whatever people to help themselves to the church a city Methodist Church is a good example of that where there is just gigantic limestone ... and you can see where a lot of them\nBeen taken and others that are just so huge people tried to get them out of the building they couldn't

have the business I guess and uh the uh all the theater\nOne or two in the palace was one of the last ones and they remodeled it and uh\nIt had only had special shows I remember they had the Jackson Five there\nThat was a special show a long time ago the marketing stayed up for you on the market for years after that show because that was the live show\nLive special show after the theaters are closed but they hid remodeling open it up and that was one of your shows than than after model they start jumped the fence that didn't last too long because the downtown just what does try something new and and\nYou could look at all well into downtown you see what it is only now\nCompared to what it was then she's here to go to the well but so much scared at just the doors moved out everybody went to nearly all the shopping malls you know they had moles outside in the city and everybody was going to the malls and that's where\nThat's where it was a because I'm a member of fellows I work
