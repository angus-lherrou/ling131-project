term new\n\nI'm Vicky Merrick the local food reports up now with ... and this week just learned more about how the new farm bill could impact local growers and consumers to changes to snap that's the acronym for the Supplemental Nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps\nRoughly every five years the house and the Senate work together to pass a new farm bill the most recent farm belt expired on September thirtieth by Congress still hasn't negotiated a new version\nFrenzy Rand off of the trail farmers' market and the nonprofit sustainable Kate says which bill passes could have big implications for Cape Cod consumers and farmers\nThat's because about Seventy five cents of every dollar in the farm bill goes to nutrition programs like food stamps or snap\nFeeding people is at the heart of the farm bill and so on snap as an enormous part of the farm bill and there are some big differences between the house and Senate right now in what is going to be happening going for\nThe big difference between the house and Senate versions of the bell has to do with unemployment requirement in the house version in order to get snap you'd actually have to have a job or being an employment training program here trying to your hand off again\nA one in eleven households currently now receiving benefits would lose eligibility if the house version went through so on the Cape that could be almost a thousand people because of the requirement because of the work requirement and there's also a requirement that if you were ever incarcerated you would not be eligible for snap\nSnap or what used to be called food stamps has been part of the farm bill since the late Nineteen thirties the original idea was to use government money to buy big agricultural surpluses like wheat or corn and distribute them to a hungry public\nMore recently though some lawmakers have work to connect the dots between feeding communities improving health outcomes and providing economic stimulus for local farmers\nI'm really it was Gus Schumacher who was former am dark commissioner Massachusetts department of agricultural resources and then went on to the Clintons under secretary of agriculture\nWho really kind of came up with this concept of 'em and nutrition incentive and I think it was called bonus bucks in Boston and what he decided that he could do is to enable people of low income through a snap card to arrive at a farmer's market\nAnd to receive some sort of bonus um\nThat benefits with farmers\nMarkets you get an extra ten dollars and free tokens if you spend ten dollars and it's not money that doesn't just benefit small farmers\nIt also makes healthy fruits and vegetables more affordable Orleans farmers' market started accepting snap benefits and participating in the nutrition incentives back in two thousand ten grand on our show who runs the market says they started off with only a few snap recipients\nSo we had maybe ten or Fifteen customers have participated in that and now I don't even know I think it's a hundred and fifty people months you know I mean it's a lot of people that we go through the Orleans farmers' market in the summertime that do that\nNoise yo and ... started the sustainable Cape farmers' market coalition in two thousand fourteen the idea was to help other farmers markets on the Cape and islands figure out how to start accepting snap and other nutrition incentives it's not rocket science but it's tedious and it's a lot easier with a template\nThe exact number of individuals receiving snap on the Cape and islands varies year to year and season to season\nBut over the past decade in ... county the number has ranged from twelve thousand to twenty thousand\nThe economic stimulus for farmers markets on the Cape has been huge into thousands Seventeen snap and other nutrition incentive put just over twenty six thousand dollars into the pockets of local growers and that's up six hundred and forty three percent in just two years here's fancy Randolph again\nIf we could move the legislation so that the snap benefits\nWere encouraging fruit and vegetable consumption and encouraging that consumption through farmers' markets we would not only be helping people on food stamps and helping local farmers we could help her long term health and help our economy so it's really a package deal that's beyond a win win\nSometimes it feels impossible to create change\nBut it's inspiring to reflect on what these two women have managed to do with snap and farmer's markets in only a few years passed farm bills have made it a priority to expand access to farmers' markets for snap recipients whether the next bill continues this trend or moves in a different direction remains to be seen\nFor another

and Republicans are pushing back\nWe'll take a close look at what exactly Congress and the Trump Administration did to change the Affordable care\nAll that and more after the news\n\n\n[noise]

it'd be an earthquake within the Democratic party no question about it you know right now there's a lot of younger democratic activists who are quietly talking about the fact that the leadership within the Democratic party is in their seventies and if the party doesn't if the Democrats aren't able to take back the house\nThen they're going they're going to be a lot of questions to ask about who that leadership will be\nAnd Tim take the flip side of that if Republicans somehow keep control of the house of representatives what are Republicans talking about the next day\nWell the president has a alluded to more tax relief for middle income Americans um uh and and on the left us there's gonna be a lot of questions on the blame game like who's responsible you know much like what happened with the Republicans\nAfter Mitt Romney lost in twenty twelve whether they'll put together some sort of introspective autopsy of what happened during this election\nWe know one thing is for sure if Republicans hold the house they will not pump the brakes are going to be stepping on the gas or an exclamation point\nNPR's Domenico Montanaro Danielle Kurtzleben and Tim Mak thanks everybody thinking You're welcome in Dominican stick with us because now it is time for race of the week [noise]\nThis against people of color I Need your help we will never die down by and if we by the way we do [noise]\nEvery week we focused on one race that tells us something about the broader election and this week we're looking at the governor's race in Georgia the medical mountain are all you're still with me how's it going hey they're working to bring in\nJohnny Kauffman of W. A. B. E. in Atlanta hey Johnny hello so Dominique oh let's start with you who are the candidates in the Republican\nIs Brian Kemp who's a secretary of state and the Democrat is Stacey Abrams she's a former house minority leader in the Georgia general assembly and Abrams would be the state's first black and female governor and the race really a statistically tied\nAnd Johnny A voter suppression or who can and can't vote has become a huge issue in this race especially as early voting has begun why is that\nHas sparred over voting for years and it's getting more and more attention as the election comes closer more specifically one issue that's drawn a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases\nThey've been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nAnd this has drawn a federal lawsuit a camp says it's all blown out of proportion that it's just a move to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams end of the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that\nHer group is responsible for these messed up applications there are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ... street as Kemp likes to point out\nBut the issue has really persisted for a long time it continues to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular\nRace has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning the Georgia flag back in the nineties at the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia for deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag with that Confederate symbols\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate symbols to be removed as well\nThe ... this is one of the top tier national\nRaces this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race that's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell Georgia is one of those states that has been traditionally Republican but there have been signs that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for the final days of this race my big\nRight now is how well he's Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in these midterm elections\nAbrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media the fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal\nJob of labeling her in a simple way that she's just too extreme for George eight\nStacey Abrams he could just be spending rating liberal [noise] she's an extremist either campaign\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting out there he runs I'm not sure has done the same with camp and so my big question is you know Abrams talks a lot about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well does that reach people in Georgia maybe a more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that that uh Abrams needs to inspire voters and the same way that Obama did in two thousand ... Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand that he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that's a huge hill let Abrams has to climb if he's going to win this race\nAnd we will have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro as well as Johnny Kauffman of W. A. B. E. Johnny thanks so much for talking to us yeah thanks for having me this is the politics show from NPR we'll be right back\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from twenty three and me a personal genetic service working to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash NPR radio\nFrom the Charles Stuart multi foundation for more than Ninety years supporting efforts to promote it just equitable and sustainable society more at ... dot org\nAnd from the John ... and James Alan nice foundation helping NPR advance a journalistic excellence in the digital age [noise]\nBack to the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow\nRare with a special broadcast every weekend through the mid term elections to guide you through everything you need to know what the election disclose people are focusing\nOn the falls to try to get a sense of what might happen on election day just about a week from ... showing Gillum was the one point lead well within the margin of error real player politics however has\nIt at a dead heat and the president's poll numbers are going out running neck and that is is the race to watch on election night the new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll confirms enthusiasm is high for both Republicans and Democrats and if you weren't sure already confirmed this\nThis election it's all about president Donald Trump and you know I like\nJoining me now to talk through this NPR's Dominican to narrow and Danielle Kurtzleben either pay part so about a month ago we had to pull out in a got a lot of national attention because it showed a lot of good news for Republicans this new poll this time around looks like Democrats are going to be happier people reading it\nWell it looks like essentially that the Kevin confirmation fight and all that it did to fire up Republicans has kind of faded to be perfectly honest\nOr it looks like we've returned to the fundamentals and that's something I've been hearing from Republicans quite a bit when you look at the landscape for the house races for example the vast majority of those races are being run in places that Republicans hold seats and that has not changed\nLet's get to the pool and the numbers are Dominican what are the biggest takeaways for you looking at this point\nThe big thing is that President Trump is seen as the biggest factor in people's vote and really the numbers are kind of remarkable even when you put them in historical context two thirds of people say that Trump is either a major or minor factor in deciding their vote in less than two weeks on November six\nCompare that to twenty fourteen when Republicans took back the Senate\nJust forty seven percent of Americans said that Iraq Obama was a factor in their vote\nAs a twenty point jumped that's a big deal and more people this time around and say that they are motivated to go vote for Democrats because of their impressions of President Trump than in twenty fourteen when people said that their impressions of President Obama made them want to go vote for a Republican\nSo I mean President Trump is campaigning saying of voters if I'm On the ballot you know this is about me get trying to get his supporters to the polls but this result shows that this is a negative\nIt depends on who you're talking to you though right I mean people in either party Democrats and Republicans once again already in their corners Trump may be affecting their vote off and he is\nAnd you know for Democrats makes them less likely to vote for Republican more likely to vote for a Democrat for Republicans vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gaps on this for example when you ask independent voters\nHow important is Trump to your vote your fifty percent of independent women saying he is very important compared to twenty eight percent of independent men that's a bigger divides and you see among Republicans or Democrats likewise\nYou mentioned some of the overwhelming statistics of of how many people are dying from overdoses I feel like almost every person in the country knows someone in one way or another who struggled with opioids this bill or it signed into law at a time where we're seeing some signs that this crisis may at least be leveling\nOff yes that came from Alex Azar\nThe secretary of the department of health and Human Services a data for the first month of twenty Eighteen indicate\nThat the number of opioid deaths is not increasing nearly as fast as in recent years he used the word plateau and that certainly hopeful term maybe a few percentage points increase this year rather than\nPrevious year and twenty Seventeen the number of Americans dying from opioids rose to Seventy two thousand from sixty four thousand the previous year a new data from the Centers for Disease Control show the numbers are not rising as fast\nIn the last ... Seventeen and the first few months of twenty eight teams so if anything that the government has been doing can further that trend\nOf both parties seem to think that's worth doing and that's at least one hopeful story this week we're talking about how this would be the rare\nPeriod where where both parties around the same page but that doesn't mean there hasn't been any criticism right that's right and there was a lot of disagreement in the process of putting this together people saying look what we need here as a tobacco up and take a much more holistic approach to the entire question but just stitching together\nAll these different programs are kind of pastiche of good intentions I that's ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say there needs to be a great deal more money\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem as we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can if we can only agree on that stitched together patchwork of programs let's at least do that\nThat's NPR's Ron Elving every week he catches up on

bill passed\nHalted from NPR's Scott Detrow\nIs here with a special broadcast every weekend in mid term election after all the votes of themselves\nAnd each week we focus on one issue on voters' minds health insurance reform becomes law in the United states is\n[noise] this week health care for my first day I'm going to ask God to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disasters Obamacare [noise]\nCARE Act Republicans found one of their best talking points they used it again and again we're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing and replacing it we're going to keep our promises\nThat gold seen within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nThe Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act has failed harsher tale of Obamacare failed by a single voter away today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare\nIt came down to just from one vote the final vote forty nine to fifty one now is the Democrats who feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about health care all election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it that has Republicans on defense and we're going to talk about all of this\nWith NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben hey guys hey Hi so let's take a few\nMinutes here to talk about health care because all year we've been talking about how Democrats the healthcare as their best issue with voters which is so striking because from twenty ten on after Obamacare passed Democrats were really on defence when it came to health care and they lost a lot of seats because of it\nSo let's start with this how are people feeling about the state of health care right now\nWould say concerned bare minimum but if you're a Democrat you're much more worry a I mean one thing we do know I can tell you from both being on the trail and from polling data is that both Republicans and Democrats are worried about the healthcare system worried about\nCrafts are much more worried and this is reflected in what voters tell you and it's reflected in ads Democrats have just been running more health care ads throughout the entire mid term cycle than Republicans half\nI'm determined to fight for affordable festival healthcare and\nTake it away like three hundred thousand nine calling Denise has a preexisting condition that used to mean no health insurance now the threat is Patrick Morsi's losses to take away health here from people with preexisting condition\nAnd what Democrats are targeting is the assault that Republicans have waged a over the last two years on the Affordable CARE Act Republicans of course campaign saying they want it to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act they weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs down in the Senate\nBut the Trump Administration has been steadily willing away at the Affordable CARE Act for\nThe last going on two years and it's worth pausing for a moment and walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have tried to undermine the Affordable CARE Act or of try to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ads\nCome down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding no I didn't so let's start with actions taken by the Trump Administration\nScott what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimpy your plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people are but could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people\nThey have done away with the marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable care act's a health care marketplaces\nThey have ended subsidies for insurance companies which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a market places and then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this sort of\nBeen an attack on the a C a insurance marketplace which despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign up so stay pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in\nAnd the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was focused on Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare they ultimately failed but what should we know about what was in those bills how\nPass because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare\nOne of the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that built those bills would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on and so many of these ads saying that\nRepresentative selling so voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace bill that bill would have done away with your protections for pre existing conditions and Scott Republicans running for reelection are defending themselves from these attacks\nIn an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate I don't care about people with preexisting conditions\nThat's right but it's interesting that Republicans are on the defensive here this is really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles when Republicans were on the attack going after the Affordable CARE Act\nPromising to repeal Obamacare and Democrats were largely staying quiet they knew that the Ford will correct wasn't terribly popular at that point\nNow we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions moving the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out this year oh democratic ads yes like Scott said more than half of them have been about health care this is according to the Wesleyan Media project which tracks these things here to tell them building Democrats feel this year that's compared to\nFrom twenty ten twenty twelve twenty fourteen twenty sixteen in those years roughly seven to ten percent of democratic ads are about healthcare Democrats did not want to touch healthcare during that time now this year they are all about it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Arts and Ideas", "city": "Brewster", "day":
