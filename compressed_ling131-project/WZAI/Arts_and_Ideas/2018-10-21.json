C. and the obstruction that's been led by my opponent and I've spent more than ... we're talking with people listening to them not lecturing them\nAnd that's why I Would like to be your voice and I'm asking for your vote on November six\nThank you and representative of the first question goes to you this evening flooding which has troubled our region in recent years is among the range of problems a recent United Nations report said that climate change is causing Canada is considering a national carbon tax isn't viable\nIs that pollution which scientists say leads to climate change can have on the United states\nWhere you can't deny the fact that we are feeling the effects of climate change and I think that ah in Massachusetts we've done a strong job of moving towards renewable energies are we've invested in fact I voted for legislation that has increased uh our goal on wind power off the shores uh at the same time we've been part of a Reggie agreement that has\nTried to make sure that there were one of the cleanest regions in the country so I think Massachusetts has been doing it very well this affects though not just the inland obviously this affects coastal areas as you've been talking about the flooding but also the fishing industry for example\nWould warmer waters off our shores we're starting to see different species coming in our fishermen are trying to catch you know the traditional cod and other fish out there and other species have now gone in there\nUnfortunately that restricts the amount of fish that they are able to bring that go to market and uh what they need to do is be able to have more of a voice with the catch limits as well now unfortunately the fisherman in New Bedford one of our bridges ports in the United states\nHas had the sector nine ground fishing industry virtually come to a standstill because there's been\nForty federal fishing licenses that have not been transferred my opponent has been asked by this New Bedford city council four times specifically four times the inner ... seed and help with the fishing industry with no regulation so they can have a stronger voice I think that's also an important part of the discussion when it comes to the effects of climate change\nA Senator Warren ill or an idea of the question is carbon a carbon tax a viable option to help this issue here in the United states\nSo it's clear to me that we need a way to make polluters pay for the damage they do and there are a lot of different ways we can do that one I'll just start right here locally and that is made GE pay to clean up the satanic river\nUm they originally agreed to and then once Donald Trump was elected they backed up and said well no let's renegotiate again and now they don't want to have to move the pollution that they caused out of state you know this is one of the consequences though of what Mr deal wants to do as Donald Trump's campaign chair\nWhen Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord not a peep from Mr deal when a coal lobbyist was put in as the head of the EPA not a peep from Mr deal you want to talk about fishing\nOne of the things that Mr deal has said is that he embraces offshore drilling I Want you to just to think about that and what that would mean for Massachusetts\nMassachusetts one spill like the kind of spills that happened down in the Gulf of Mexico\nAnd all of our fishing industry is wiped out our tourism industry on the east coast is wiped out and the way of life that we have nurtured for centuries will be gone but\nClimate change is real and it is urgent problem that we need to bear down on it and we need to bear down on it now I have a bill to try to push corporations to do more on climate change at all starting to say one minute for about our\nShores so a much like\nThe center who mistakenly thought that I was at a police rally there was some sort of tied to some racist rally or she's also mistaken on saying that I support offshore drilling in fact I was on W. GBH radio\nOr several months ago with Jim and Marjory talking specifically on record as saying I'm against anything that's going to affect our fishermen and the wind turbine placements that we're trying to get done to create more energy here in Massachusetts\nUm the other thing too are affecting the environment that's really bad and I think we need to make sure we focus on is the CFO ... that have been a found on military bases right out here west field or the other thing too is that is also found on turnout gear for firefighters causing a health risk for them including cancer and I think uh companies like\nDupont who are manufacturing and have been responsible ... bees should also be held responsible they're\nExcellent senator one minute so I thought that Mr deal might want to go with what he said on W. GBH to the people of Massachusetts\nBut on September twenty six twenty Seventeen when he was on southern sense radio Mr deals said quote you have to have all the options on the table and so to me offshore drilling any and all places where we can get that energy and reasonable way versus quote\nI'm all for it on her words he goes and says one thing somewhere else I'm all for offshore drilling it comes to Massachusetts who says well maybe not so much because he thinks the W. GBH audience might not be quite so supportive\nYou know and he raised the point twice now about the rallies that he attended there was a rally in born\nOrganized by act for American a group that the Southern Poverty Law Center designated as a hate group and described as quote the largest anti Muslim group in America he was there on April ... April twenty second twenty eight team the photograph actually showed the group and at that time that time we're going to move on\nThe American outdoor brands corporation formerly Smith in Washington which is based right here in Springfield provides needed jobs at the same time guns produced in Springfield haven't used to harm others elsewhere including in Parkland, Florida during a school shooting\nHow do you balance the need for those jobs and keeping the public safe\nI actually I don't see these two things the same conflict\nTo help people around the country in other states because I Want some allies down in Washington the best way I can protect healthcare right here in Massachusetts is to have more people in Washington who care about health care\nBy the way that repeal of health care that Mr deal has embraced Donald Trump is embrace the Republicans have embraced would cost Massachusetts more than two billion dollars every single year and repeal their protections for people with preexisting conditions this really matters\nCenter worn thank you and the next question does start when you talk about Social Security played so there are Fifteen Years until Social Security is expected to pay eighty cents on the dollar do you see a way to fix the system to avoid those benefits being reduced\nSo I appreciate the question but I actually think the frame a little bit with respect to send the wrong place the Republicans just gave away a trillion and a half dollars to giant corporations and billionaires through a tax scam\nAnd now the debt has one and what does the Republicans said is the appropriate response now it's time to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block\nThat's the Republican plan not wait not strength and it put it on the chopping block so let me just stop right here and say I will never vote to cut Social Security I Will never vote to cut Medicare these are basic programs that people have paid for it that they are entitled to\nThe idea that the Republicans are running a scam saying we're going to give billions of dollars away to giant corporations that now have\nRecord tax and ... a record profits\nAnd then turn around and take it out on the backs of people who collect Social Security and rely on Medicare we don't need to cut Social Security and Medicare we need to expand it I have already introduced legislation I introduced ... years ago\nTo say as we need to move forward on making Social Security stronger financially\nBut make sure it's there for every one of our seniors after a lifetime hard work you should be entitled to matter\nOf time thinking very much or do you see a way to fix the system so that benefits to Social Security won't be renting\nHappening right now in fact my opponent has vowed to repeal the very mechanism that his refueling Social Security and Medicare the tax\nAgainst which she has vowed to repeal has now created new jobs has created increased wages that create the payroll taxes that go into refill now we as a country are starting to see in just a year the effects of this tax reform bill giving us\nFour point one GDP record unemployment fifty years since we've had unemployment at the level it's at now Massachusetts is actually beating the national number on unemployment Massachusetts has benefited greatly eighty percent of Massachusetts residents received a tax cut\nBecause of this tax reform bill but Senator Warren joined a Nancy Pelosi and calling it crumbs saying that the people were\nNot getting what they were they were do which is finally a break from federal government so we're seeing people now having more jobs are having higher wages and in Massachusetts are state revenues exceeded one point two billion dollars in unanticipated tax revenue because of all the investment companies are putting into it and by the way I Want to add\nMy wife and I own a small business we invested their life savings to start it we've had it for sixteen almost Seventeen years now and you know what\nIt's time for government to finally help us from the largest corporate rate in the world to allowing us to finally reinvest in our business is Ninety percent of businesses in our country our twenty employees are lower their\nEntire thank you and your about all US Senator Warren some people have suggested raising the retirement age to Seventy two as a solution to this ... thing\nI think that's the wrong approach I think the right approach is that we put the money into Social Security that it takes to meet our obligations\nBut let's be clear what the Republicans want to do is just run a scam on the American people and the scam starts by cutting revenues to the federal government\nYou know the idea that somehow the federal government's getting richer check the facts on this the debt is going up and the Republicans are saying openly this is even a secret\nTime to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block that people what they depend on so for me this one is easy this tax break was a scam from the beginning\nExxon alone one company gets more in tax breaks than Ninety five percent of all the people in the commonwealth of Massachusetts those breaks didn't go to small businesses they went to giant businesses because that's who the Republicans want government to work for\nI resented ... and you're about all the same question and raising the retirement age to Seventy two is that something you\nBacked government is taking in record revenues they'd never taken in more tax revenue than before however what's needed is sending someone to Washington that's going to also do this type of part of cutting spending now on begin hill I took on special interest to repeal the index gas tax when I knew that we were wasting\nBillions of dollars of taxpayer money it wasn't going where it was supposed to fifty percent of the gas tax at the time was going to the MBTA which had six billion dollars of deferred maintenance their pension fund was upside down they were asking us to fact fill it over and over again one year we found out a year later the twenty five million dollars had been stolen\nBy a fund manager that worked for the MBTA pension fund then went to work for another company\nOr to take that money so look government has the revenue and you just have the fiscal discipline to try to make sure it's been where it's supposed to go that's why you need to send someone who is willing to stand up to things like the Olympics center to warn her rating on cutting spending zero\nHave to leave it there thank you and the next question does go he represented if President Trump who you've said he was deported has called people name he's called them horse Hayes on Twitter he's called them flakes he's used ethnic slurs\nDoesn't name calling and personal attacks that are coming in Washington these days lead to effect of governing in your opinion and if elected\nWhat do you do anything to combat these types of attacks\nYou know carry it is disappointed to see how Washington dysfunction you know I certainly don't\nFollow the same path that the president does on how I legislate\nOr how I deal with people but at the same time my opponent has made comments that are pretty disturbing as well she said that anybody who voted for the president was part of an ugly stew of racist okay\nShe said that when Republicans wanted to try to fix health care that we wanted blood money from the American people she's you know called to abolish ice and you know what when you have rhetoric that undercuts law enforcement you end up having people like a Cambridge supporter of hers who put a five hundred dollar bounty if\nSomebody would shoot somebody from ice okay that's how low things have gotten I Want to be a different voice I have not\nEnact acted like that up on ... I certainly won't follow the path of Senator Warren on trying to villain I didn't hit us together that's not what our country needs right now\nI don't want to make sure that when I go down to Washington we followed by example on that now at the same time if you look at the president and his track record I Will say that we're finally seeing economic benefits from being an office we're seeing international benefits you know a year ago we had North Korea threatening our allies with nuclear weapons\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nPresident Trump and his name calling yeah your campaign sent out an email and may titled quote Mick Mulvaney the mosquito and that went on to say calling members of the president's staff quoting here blood suckers and henchmen how do you justify calling President Trump out for his name calling but then using language like that\nOkay so what we call them and mosquito you're right and um but here's the deal\nWhat we're really talking about is hateful illness against groups against how it is that you pick the most vulnerable and really go after them and you know I understand my opponent stance here he sounds reasonable he says this is not how he wants to have\nBut just look at his own record and who he's been supporting\nShe toward the border with the leader of a group that associates with white supremacists and wants to return this country to a time when quote gays were in the closet and blames Jews for nine eleven he attended a rally organized by the largest anti Muslim hate group\nHe supported naming black lives matter as a hate group he defended Trump's racist attacks against a Latino federal judge look he's stayed on his Trump's campaign chairman even after the Access Hollywood tapes came out\nHe got the endorsement of vice president Pence who spearheaded legislation to permit discrimination against el G. P. T. Q. people\nThat's ultimately what this is about this is about ugly slurs and who's going to support that kind of ugliness that turns Americans against Americans that turns people against people that says if there's a problem in your life it's their fault\nThat's what Donald Trump and his campaign chair Mr deal both support\nTheir representative one minute\nNow Senator Warren was just at a rally against justice Kavanaugh would Linda source or one of the most noted anti Semitic voices in the United states right now that's who she likes to hang out with and just so you know Senator Warren herself\nI I'm a kid who wanted to be a public school teacher and by the time I graduated from high school we didn't have the money for college application much less a chance for me to actually go to college\nA lot of twists and turns in my story but my big chance was a commuter college that cost fifty dollars a semester and it opened a million doors for me I Am the daughter of someone who ended up as a janitor and I got to be a professor in the United states senator\nThose opportunities are disappearing for other kids I'm In this fight for them\nThan it I'll give you a chance for an extra minute if you'd like it I Know you said that you were finished with that issue\nWell look she's actually talked about her background I think people should know that I didn't get into politics\nThere was a calling it was not a career my wife and I own a small business I was on the Finance Committee my town but I felt like the system on beacon wasn't working for the people in my district that I originally was elected to represent\nNow I've actually cut taxes since I've been in office because that was one of the things I felt was important to give people a chance to get ahead now my opponent has proposed things that will massively increase people's taxes\nAnd by the way there's only one millionaire with a mansion in this room right now up here and that as Senator Warren\nWho by the way falsified her tax returns calling them entry errors when she took a fifty thousand dollar deduction for clothing fifty thousand dollars I don't even have that type of clothing in my house with a wife and two daughters are but that was the entry she put it in to reduce her own taxes so it is about\nA system that may be rigged unfortunately we have a senator who seems to me that\nThey're in one minute for about a show you know Mr deal says he's not a millionaire but here's the trick is actually no way of actually knowing that\nBecause his taxes are are not on line he hasn't revealed he keeps it all secret yeah he's filled out the disclosures disclosures with huge ranges so you really just don't know what's going on in fact Mr deal has revealed exactly the same number of tax returns that Donald Trump pass\nAnd that zero but look for me what this is really about is are we going to be transparent about who we work for I put everything out on the Internet and\nYou're right there is a mistake on my taxes it made no difference in how much I owed there isn't interior and there may be some other mistakes in it\nBut it put it out there for people to see because I don't want this to be about me I Want this fight to be about the next kid who needs a chance to go to school I Want it to be about the kids who need health care I Want it to be about people who are about to retire and that's how it shouldn't matter\nTo our next question is about commuter rail service commuter rail service from western Massachusetts ease a to Boston is seen by many hairs and assess any what if anything do you think that Congress should you take care of money for the potential project\nOh so this is one of my priorities I'm so glad you asked about this\nAnd that is to make the investments in infrastructure so that we can get high speed rail from Boston to west or to Springfield and by the way if we're doing infrastructure investment we also need to make sure that we're investing in communications uh so that all of it\nYou can't be part of the twenty first century economy with out that\nBut here's the problem again the Republicans have given away a trillion and a half dollars to the most profitable corporations to billionaires and so when they talk about oh yeah they've got some infrastructure plan\nTurns out it's not real it's all smoke and mirrors it's all about oh well let's see the federal government will put up one dollar it's localities can put up four dollars and how well the federal government even put up that one dollar\nWell actually the way it's going to work is they're going to keep the money that otherwise had been going to cities right here like Springfield [noise]\nYou know we just can't keep doing this this is this fundamental question who do you think government should work for\nThe Republicans Donald Trump Mr deal says make it work better and better for you enter and center slice at the top instead of making the investments in infrastructure that we need right here in western Massachusetts in education in building a future for every now\nAnd that's time what if anything do you think should be done at this level ... east to west\nKnow Senator Warren I talked before this started about how we both were in traffic to get here for the debate\nAnd I can feel the pain because I've been out there on my campaign RV\nOr driving around the state for over a year talking to people and when we're driving from let's say agawam up to a Pittsfield sometimes you lose your wife I sometimes you lose your cell phone connection we do need communications infrastructure because communications infrastructure will allow central and western Massachusetts\nTo bring some of the businesses that are currently overcrowding eastern Massachusetts is great that the seaport in Boston has\nGE and has med tech in these\nCompanies that are coming in and building you know new headquarters in Boston is wonderful but there's a lot of people who need those opportunities those jobs in central and western Massachusetts so we have the communications infrastructure that incentivize is\nThe business has to come out here as far as rail I totally agree now obviously the first thing you have to think about is the fact that we're currently having a tough time affording the rail system we have so maybe we look at\nPrivate partnerships to get real back out here that's how this country and the state first started private industry I Know Senator Warren says that you didn't build that when she first ran for office she said it was government roads will have to tell you it was the machine shops in Springfield in Holyoke it was the shoe factories in Brockton it was the fishing industry of bluster New Bedford\nBut hospitals the first to care people provided the money to build those roads we need to make sure businesses are given the chance to grow as well so we can have those funds to build the\nRanking even senator one minute so\nThis is the standard Republican playbook say that you're all in favor of infrastructure somehow the public sector doesn't really have to put up the money the private sector is going to do it and guess what the infrastructure never gets built and that's exactly\nWhere we find ourselves in western Massachusetts how many times have politicians like Mr deal stood up and said over and over yeah we need that high speed rail and totally in favor of that high speed rail\nBut when it comes down to it won't vote to be to put the funds in so that you can actually build the high speed rail look we ought to be putting real money in at the federal government level and we could do that except for the fact\nThat the Republicans Mr deal Donald Trump have given away a trillion and a half dollars\nTo billionaires and giant corporations it's the ultimate question of who government works for it shouldn't be working just for the rich and the powerful infrastructure is how we build a future for all of us are presented at one minute\nSure we'll look I Know about infrastructure when we did the gas tax by the question in two thousand fourteen we knew exactly where a lot of money was going and where should have been going and we're too much money was going in fact in Massachusetts we're number two to New Jersey for what we spend to maintain our roads\nAnd so when we want to build rail we need to have the money available and not wasted in other areas Massachusetts spends six hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars\nPer mile per year to maintain our roads now the national average is a hundred and forty five thousand dollars per mile per year\nAll right that's New Hampshire they pay the national average their roads are in pretty good shape Massachusetts could be spending their money more efficiently that were to leave us the money to put it where we needed whether it's going to be improving the rail system that we have\nThat had six billion dollars of deferred maintenance over the last decade or whether it's making sure that we can try new lines to get more service to get more people to and from job locations that are going to help grow the economy and pay the taxes that build the rail\nYou the right to answer to the next question\nIsn't it that it tells us that the Hispanic population in western Massachusetts is growing and according to the few Research Center the number of Hispanics eligible to vote has steadily grown yet they're voting in mid term elections has declined since two thousand and six according to ...\nHave you taken steps to reach out to minority voters\nOf course when you're going out or talking to people on the campaign trail you attend parade you go door to door you go to different communities of course\nI've been to a Lawrence I've talked to a lot of people there during their festivals I've been to New Bedford a marching in their parades talking to the\nResidents there are people of all races it's not to me a campaigning about trying to reach just one segment but I Will say you know as far as the Hispanic community and not voting that's not good to hear and perhaps they're feeling the same thing a lot of people are feeling disgust\nWith the people that are currently elected discussed with the Washington and the way it's functioning maybe distrust would beacon Helen how they don't seem to be looking after the interest of the people we have more and more ballot questions\nGoing on every year instead of legislators actually doing their job we have to decide nursing levels we have to decide marijuana laws you know what casinos had to be put in the hands of the people why aren't lawmakers doing what they're supposed to be doing so if any one segment of our state\nIs not happy with politicians and politics I get it uh but uh hopefully you know in this case people look at me regardless of their background and say here's someone who has been fighting to make sure they have more money in their pockets make sure the jobs are out there and I certainly welcome or anybody from the Hispanic community to support my campaign and make sure that I'm working for them down in Washington\nCenter has your campaigned and things to reach out to minority voters saying what you've been on the trail\nWe don't just do this during campaign of course we have", "show_name": "Arts and Ideas", "year": "2018", "city":
