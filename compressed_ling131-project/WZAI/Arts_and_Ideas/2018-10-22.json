flute on surf Dr beach for years become a fixture for visitors in regulars\nBecause he's usually surrounded\nBy dogs Haley Fager who produces arts and ideas has this report\nIf you're walking along their strength beach on a late afternoon you might see Mike Martin sitting in his car\nOn landscaping in irrigation\nEvery day after work to play for the ducks and feed them cracked corn\nI don't know much about ducks the peaceful and docile and I like to be peaceful and also you know so I just relate to them they relate to me we hang up [noise]\nThis is a\nLong one I knew he makes a band the flu itself\nYou really have to hit the flu that full volume to to them so it comes to the beach\nI don't want to be in the house because it bothers the cats and the dogs so you don't want to be next to people who can help it and that's why I Try and find that the beaches you know and I don't get too loud\nAnd I grew up playing piano and guitar and has spent a lotta time performing on the side he was in a band recently but it's tough being fun\nWe just didn't see eye to eye and I said look to be honest with you I'm just as happy sitting at the beach playing my food to a bunch of docs\nAnd so I left [laughter] rather than deal with that I just come down here and deal with these guys sometimes I'm a\nI'm accused of not playing well with others the mushrooms rather ... musical instrument\nMakes work landscaping are digging irrigation systems can be solitary and he jokes that he's not so good with people\nBut that's not how locals around here describing he's pretty hip guy very kind like somebody look forward to the tennis star Monti grew up and found that she used to work at the bowling alley where Mike as part of the league and one day she saw him on the beach playing flute for the ducks\nAnd I remember he had like names for a lot of the dogs like he knew like what specific ones were which whether you had like names for them or not and he would be out there like playing the flu for them and stuff\n[laughter] [noise] I have like when we were broken legs back to the referee place but they couldn't save him broke his leg first he lasted a year and a half with it had a permanent limb but then he broke the right leg that was mostly because of all left one of course\nThere are some more me with a lot harder [laughter] well\nMaybe they're just waiting for the crimes for it but it really does seem like a duck surviving along to the\nMake fun of the band do for the flu in his backyard he uses other flip she's made to measure the length and basically eyeballs the distance between the holes\nAnd that's why they're so imperfect but that's okay I like the perfect part of them\nSharp as a whole big or small wind them a little out of time\nIn the little fat that comes to file\nMight give the flutes as gifts to people who enjoy the music and appreciate the ducks and I got a flu from Mike at the high school graduation present a couple of years ago he knew she was nervous about graduating\nSo it was like kind of special and he told me how to play it and stuff like it was really it was kind of difficult that for [laughter] I don't really like use it too much but just like the sentiment of it was really nice I think that uh that grouchy old man saying that he sees himself as isn't necessarily true\nI call a couple of them the fissures I'm Mr Mrs Fisher they'll they'll hang over to the left and they'll dart in and out of the waves and catch fish and told them to each other\nLike isn't the only one that feeds the ducks a lot of people come to start trying to reach me cracked corn or stale bread make told me it's a way for people to feel like they're doing something right but there's also this\nWhere did I say the lady the seats are

I made my weddings okay like I created flowers from pieces of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom's wedding veil\nAnd he went along with all of this [laughter] he actually went with me to thrift stores picking out all the mix snatched vintage plates we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little talk first for the twelve cakes we were going to have is twelve I'm a big believer in cake so [noise]\nHe cared about to mostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle he composed it an orchestrated it and send it off to the band and we got prepared for our big day\nIt's going to be so beautiful like an anthropology catalog threw up over everything but [noise] that's what I wanted [laughter]\nWe got married on April twenty fourth which isn't my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years when the day of my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring us the same good luck\nAnd we were married outside St Louis Missouri in a town called ... core which is his home town and his sister's back yard\nSo on April twenty fourth we hung outlived twinkling lights and the trees decorative little stars put out tables in my beautiful center pieces and on every seat lay down a custom made played bill I had done for the events\nNow and all of this preparation he failed to mention that April in Missouri is tornado season [noise] I was actually watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins and to the shapes of swans when the tornado siren\nWent off and then came the rain and then the hail\nAnd wins and it knocked all of the tables over and all of my beautiful center pieces into the mud six months of making them every night\nAnd they were destroyed no one saw any of it\nLuckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter]\nThat's the only time that's lucky by the way\n[laughter] we had invited\nThese artists and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do this pitch a tent so up like the big top and we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made got my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trapped in and were ready to begin now\nRabbit was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't get into a little card I made so we just proceed without her\n[noise] um [noise] I was looking forward to the song\nHadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play it because the bandleader had a heart attack [noise] he's fine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing it without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nFavorite show so um [noise] the photographer\nHad never shot a wedding before so she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some guy showed up and apparently brought a stomach virus that I had not registered for um [noise] so throughout the state people kept getting sick and dropping like flies\nAmongst all of this the worst part for me was that my dad decided not to come I didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle and so he said I'm not going to be there I have a stepfather that I've had since I was seven years old and\nI didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself\nBut he didn't like it and so he chose not to come to\nMy mom called them I called them and he said well I send a check\nAs if that's the same thing\nOn his only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding and that will always be true but I Can't do a father and daughter dance by myself\nSo I I danced with his dad my grandfather and as we swayed beneath the big top [laughter] he looked at me and said your dad should have been here\nAnd he should have been [noise] and then\nMaybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise] all of our hamburger spiders just went up in flames [laughter]\nBut\nAlso missed the double rainbow that came out after the storm it finally passed by I mean a star friends singing\nHas to pay and jump around [noise]\nAnd so\nAfter all it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle police max and the specialty cocktail I have made [laughter] which is just jak and coke\nBut [noise] in fact it was our\nAnd the family that showed up for us\nAfter all the details don't make the day\nAnd they don't make the marriage either because I'm not married anymore and I don't think a perfectly sunny day and matching escort cards would have changed that we shouldn't have gotten married there's some things even take can't fix\nMaybe if I hadn't been so caught up in all of the preparations I Would have realized that but there are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happens after the big day is over\nBut\nEven though it began with the storm it didn't end with one we were married increased corps which literally translates to broken heart and my dad says now [noise] [noise] well it looks like I didn't miss anything anyway\nFrance was shoes us all off into the yard under the worms guy in the twinkle lights into the patio with the glistening paint where we step out of our clothes\n[noise] and find a partner and a brush [noise]\nAnd paint to each other [noise]\nInto the colorful birds and wild animals that underneath it all we all are

Mm\nMm\nMm\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to them off radio our friend PR acts I'm Jennifer accent mixed up our final story it's another from our show in Albuquerque with our partners K. and here's Kristin reef lives\nSo bright spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trailer with my partner best he's just ahead of me on the path and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now\nHey best Jew and have a baby silence he turns around and I see that he has laughing at me this is the stupidest\nIdea you've ever had no I don't want to have a baby\nIn his defense or we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while\nI'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of Haley ... had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just starting to get that\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth to a baby\nA this has been some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender\nAh for me that means that I was born female [noise] um I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling of feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nA and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem um and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant that um I could stay alive a and I could transition and I could be happy\nUm which is what I did um [noise]\n\nUh I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland\n[noise] uh\nIt turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nBut you know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby\nA and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to have the beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and if it was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am\nI'm but I uh live in a world of rainbows and unicorns ah and I just hoped that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer\nI'm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was and good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a and a few months went by\nNothing happened um and I started to think maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all\nI woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I refuse and he's a pregnancy test and then that's made me and I took it\nAnd there were two lines and I was pregnant and there was going to be a baby you know [laughter] but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for a baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of the baby [noise]\n\nHayley in while even toddlers when they came to live with us so I didn't know what to do with a baby um and then my body started to change really quickly I'm an all of those ah markers of femininity everything just got bigger everywhere\nAnd I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on to my twin sister and I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like ... my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do\nOr I could get excited about the thing that it can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just let everything else go\nAh and laid around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly\nUm and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out as trans um because our lives our misery says the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes there is hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color\nBut for all of us there's also a joy and love and and resilience and family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready um and we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone\nCNN a Washington Post people magazine pregnant man and I thought that maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\n\nThey were into it you know um\nMost

it's an important report but it's not surprising report in the surprise is how we keep getting surprised about the same thing again and again and again I don't think it's a more frightening report than previous ones are as your intro said we've been sleeping\nSo we haven't been hitting what the BCC has been saying we haven't been hitting for nature has been telling us all around us not just in Florida\nOwner was to show the Southeast Asia all over Europe\nAnd uh so so in in some ways you know uh it's it's like the same thing that should be the game and again and again what what's new in these cascading feedback loops for example\nSo I I think what's new here is this one point five degree sort of which has become the new uh ... uh scared of a dog get that off of the world is going to somehow become a is reverse simply different my point is that the voters are ready if it was to be different\nThat for hundreds of millions of people in the world the Buddhist people in the what some of the ... the word climate change is not something you talk about the future debts\nHe's famous changes something that has hit that is happening that is happening now and my um issue but the report if any is that it's maybe not fighting enough it's it's trying to fight in the ... about the future\n... really fully telling us about the president I can see why they're doing it because they want is for other mostly you and meet people people who are affluent into action and this is one more Democrats saying he'll guard please do something and do it now I think that's the that's a good message\nBut there's another message and the messages that climate change is happening now it's happening in ... it's happening in Pakistan it's happening in Haiti it's happening in malicious it's happening in in in ... too and it's happening and this is the key point it is happening\nMostly not most is happening with grievous consequences in places which had the nice to do with causing the problem\nSo those who had leased to do with making the mess on at the front forefront of having to deal with that that is why I think climate is a justice issue and this report\nDon't think I've done justice to climate as a justice issue\nYeah we've got to get ahead or in so many aspects would stick with justice for the one of the blocks in our understanding or just our humanity that don't see much\nOf it as as as the eye of the store and say how many other\nPlace I think it does the humanity um that is at best here I think at best here does not science\nWrite me VIP says he keeps coming up in ... I'm a fan of hypotheses yeah being part of it but this is no longer the question of science the big thing is the big challenges knocked\nWhether we have enough science or not the big challenges whether we have enough action or not and why is that not happening that does eat a question of odd humanity as you point that I eat of ethics and within ... as a species are fully evolve to look at ourselves and our survival as a species and I'm not sure we are\nAnd the second thing is I think this is they just enough technology that is enough science there's enough knowledge for us to make a difference\nI Am not convinced anymore but there is enough visited him in a species\nTo act in time and to act for the benefit of the entire species or if I can say something other harsh or your mission I think in some ways\nAll of us who saved the climate ... do not actually it gets you to St Louis enough because we've all figured out that we probably will shrimp\nIt's kind of a like a ... that was that was about to go down we all taught me to go down with it and now suddenly realize oh maybe not\nMaybe some of us will make it to the fight and at that point your challenges are you going to lend a hand to those who will go down and the fact of the matter is we have not been doing that\nYou know politicians take a lot of heat and they should for being unwilling to risk their jobs but I mean every one of us I think is is is afraid to doing something serious would\nRisk their own jobs so yes oh yes I I think that does vi V. have kind of made\nMade the fact that somehow the guards of technology\nAnd the guards off the free market ... village somehow find a solution and dime for us to be saved and maybe the right but the problem is that not all of us and we'll be saved and as I said it is\nThose who had released to do what's causing the mess that are having to face the consequences there are limits here on our\nThere's also years and years along like butter conditioning we're told over and over again that it's it's great to be rich anybody can strive for\nThe degrees of mechanism mechanization but of privilege of leisure of fun that we have defined as human would be very hard to get up at this point [laughter]\nYes and frankly I see that you know it's a it's a question of justice here's here's the thing\nOf fighters natured dog gets deport what does nature and a half to ... what does nature have against the ... people in the woods and the fact of the matter is that if you are full of you will end up living in the most fun ... says\nAnd if you are the Buddhist living in the most wanted list places you it is most likely that you do not have the ability to deal with those disasters ... so the disaster comes to Florida and a disaster comes to cut Archie or Mumbai\nBut if you are on the edge in Mumbai you're much less likely to have the resources to deal with it and and the point I'm making about you know this is no longer the future of the issue with this this report and we still talk about climate as if it's something fought in the distance or maybe not that fought in the distance but still something in the future\nBut to cross the world it is not a future to look at the heat waves going around ... ... a look at floods my country Pakistan there is now for the last six seven years\nIt continuous floods every year there's a flood with number of deaths at the same time that our drugs at the same time the U.S a heat wave sticking more life in Karachi this summer at that time more people died in the heat wave\nThen through terrorism\nIn the ... right right and this is a violent place anyhow so the point I'm making is that nature of this telling us that the normal the Newton automobile is a climactic change not model for a lot of places and who's paying the price is the Buddhist the those who at least able\nTo do something about this those who were released responsible for causing the mass\nAre we still talk down to the poor and the great minds of the west including that one of ... rays are going to tell the world or how to how to deal with the problem that we in the ... so many sort of uh we we need ourselves coming and going west produce the industrial revolution that created the problem\nSomehow we expect that those geniuses\nNow you know and love how are you going to solve this problem I think I Want it I maybe you can tell us oh what\nDo the light footprint people the world in impacts to hunted Africa in China um have to offer this conversation that we're not hearing\nI Do do do they do have to offer an idea of an ideal of life that is not as driven by the ideal of grow as a model is but here's the thing that we should also be concerned about the light footprint people as you as you put it\nI've seen the same word you and I\nAnd they're saying that these heavy for ... ... ... ... people are taking too many resources away from me and maybe I Need to be in the same place so we're not Martin Greece was exactly right on as you can not you can not\nFind the finger to the Buddhist people of the world and say why do you want to drive a car why do you want to use the French\nLike if we are not able to change our lifestyle we can not a ... bill the oldest of the world you know you used to being great so we have to live like this but you you must save the planet for our future generation that cannot work and it's everything that it is not working\nI did my job I Want you to review your own history in this in this battle you go back to Rio Nineteen Ninety to\n[noise]\nI'm Christopher like this is open source in the ever energetic and plus one magazine on line one article yesterday jumped out from all the commentary we've seen on climate and the un report\nIt said among other things when it comes to the centrist ... not greasy which has been shaping our response to global warming in general the article noted is not the ... is wearing new clothes it's that his whole suit is on fire\nI J seeing Chaudhry wrote the piece and he joined us by phone you see executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research his book in progress is on politics in the age of the and throw a scene the manmade Iran Jay welcome\nThank you for having me Chris Wray you said in that article that the goal is containing heat rise is\nOn its face impossible President Trump oddly enough says the same but he's not bothered by explaining that\nWell it's not that it's not\nPossible um it's like doing it with in the system\nThe most frequently gesture to is the you know Paris climate accord um which are sort of a contradictory in and out themselves um they want to achieve this uh these stated targets of you know less than one point five and ... and probably you know top out around to\n'em but they want to do it with our existing social economic and political system actually a lot of what I'm Talking to John just said I Would I Would just agree with so much of it um I Would spin it ever so slightly differently though and I emphasize some different things which is that there's a word that\nIt seems to be missing 'em from these conversations which is capitalism\nUm it's not that humanity is in fact doing all these things\nI'm humanity doesn't stand in the way of um some of the mitigation and an adaptation efforts that could be done\nUm it's that we have a socio economic system that is predicated on the kind of extractive um fuel sources and general extractive regimes right whether we're talking about social systems\nUm economic systems can of course a fossil fuels and planetary boundaries I'm that keep it going in the way that we know it\nUsed to be in your own high carbon economic growth and promised to of course um and I I Wonder if I'm hearing your definition of capitalism in the world\n[laughter] I mean it it's funny I'm In that same article I get into this question of of definitions to sort of obliquely at the end um because like the truth is there's a lot of things and he can do and I listen to a whole host of them the article um\nAnd and the\nA lot of things we could do and whether or not what happens on the other side of that and I I tend to agree absolutely would doctor and John but he was saying that the problem is not the future economic stress that enough um that that we are living through this you know right now\nUm and there's a lot that we can do and whether what what comes out of that you know what sort of springs fourth is capitalism we want to call it something else post capitalism is it real so like socialism like God Knows um but it is so dramatically different than the socio economic order we have now\nUm and it's and it's fundamental to understand and so and that's why it's sort of so hard to hear and I think for many people um people who who you know do you propose these sort of small bore reforms whether it be you know like having a cap and trade system using market incentive\nBroad based a political transformation\nUm and the other thing I Would emphasize is uh uh I you know ... ... talking to John was correct in saying that you know this will hit 'em hardest areas that have a ... that have contributed to lease um but that's not just sort of an iron right it's a he said ... nature targeting people\nUm the truth is the same system that whole that debt I'm\nDr such extraordinary inequality in our world and such extraordinary I'm In balance of power between north and global south awesome drive and support and are necessary for the maintenance of capitalism as we know it\nDoes if we're going to have in mind that change seriously we have to take capitalism seriously\nWhen the world the capitalism created in some sense but come back to the Trump ... New York times you don't believe that he's not responded to this and they think he's stupid and he doesn't get it but you point out that he was very phone scores on this\nProblem estimated that by the end of the century the heat rise will be not one point five it will be four degrees centigrade\nAnd there's a way I Want you to explain it in which he has incorporated this into his thinking about the world you call it and he might do right wing climates realism unpack that\nSure happy to um [noise]\nYou know I Do think that there's off in a way in which we talk about these conversations again as if everyone like the world is going to end right it's the apocalypse like um everyone's gonna die so this is that we're all gonna die writes a quote from that that happens on but the truth is actually on\nAre a lot of people that blow a and leek and sort of very easily imagine in our minds but they're the demographics um the wealth levels um the placement of the people that are actually going to do pretty well through this period and\nUm and I do sort of think there is a nice and you know whether a Trump actually leave that are not God Knows I'm not going to speculate about what he actually believes are not\nUm but I Do think there was something in that um [noise] in that study that was so fascinating 'cause they were basically saying they were leaving that denialism behind oh there's no such thing with the Chinese have a and going instead with yup it's going to happen and it's too late and there's nothing to do about it\nOn and what's so fascinating to me there is one that isn't on a statement or at least partially right\nI'm trying to overturn the fuel efficiency standards and the truth is\nLike jet fuel efficiency standards there right now I'm going to try and that's not going to turn the tide air right when they say is that usual all have the natural scientific literature often leads to a degree or more increase like nothing if he changed now and that's what's gonna happen\nOn those things are true and I think that that's something that um again it's sort of missing from this conversation which is that it's a political conflict um\nYou know it's strange because yeah it ... the ... are rising um the crisis is not going to be good for Trump's base it may be good for his ten best friends they have their opinions they have their mountaintops they have their\nTheir um uh you know my law goes although that's going to be pretty soggy for the first five floors I Wonder do you have your ... waiters capitalism in your view figure among the obstacles to progress here are the owners of the problem\nI I think the the beliefs that come with the models that we have on a major part of the problem in the sense that it is this belief in the gospel of wrote\nA and of continues to grow up in the planet that is a very serious levels not inflict\nA and and and everyone's growth right that's that's the thing that everyone has to constantly grow at some point and I'm going to meet involved in that one might be climate change but different people being made to order differently by my estimation at least a billion people in the wound up to date\nTwenty two thousand eighty at least a billion people in the winter do you live in what I call the age of ...\nThe ... in the ... would we have to do something to stop climate they have to actually adapt to climate that has changed for them and and that means that they have to\nDig disease sources and use them to adapt to this ... my only issue might when they don't issue but my only question I think from the ... the ... who I I also agree with this I Am not as confident that climate will force us to change the more you\nKnow unfortunately I think the model is stronger and more to\nDo with the environmental legacy of force of habit or privilege or these but does the balance of power\nAnd and and and and the ship and and the because ah I don't see the video\nThat's a neat uh what what is it political change that could work toward your dream\nOr to me please\nUh yes and I mean ... strangely uh I I there's a lot of ice cream with on a I think you can see\n'em a couple of things that that could be hopeful for the political picture\nAnd I will say that that ... ah it's likely neither neither I don't even know like a fifty fifty which I think what I'm professor read that\nUm you know it even worse than that I'm not sure example I think there is a growing awareness of of the problems I'm In a in the global north um which I think most people have a a note it is a sort of primary source of this problem um\nFor his firing radio makers are doing tips production to track from the other one you can also find applications for two months storytelling Sharon Sharon rights with over another

than the time you actually spent with the physician [noise] what is the only person you saw when you went to the doctor's office with the doctor\n[noise] there's a growing trend micro medical practices were doctors do it all from taking your blood pressure to building your insurance Dr Christie ... has a micro practice in Portland, Oregon the first thing you notice when you come into office is that there's really no waiting room\nThere's an exam room and a space that looks a lot like the living room where Christie meets with her patients before and after their medical exam\nShe's an internist and pediatrician her patient call her doctor Chrissy she says the in formality is intentional\nPart of the philosophy behind having a more accessible approached medicine is being more a more human more more accessible I'm In every way\nWhen you graduated from medical school what did you envision in terms of of a job I envisioned\nAccepted a job in a multi specialty care center where I worked with probably over a hundred other physicians and had a very busy day of twenty plus patients each day had a panel live close to two thousand patients very quickly and\nMany primary care doctors expect coming out is just sort of to jump on the treadmill and start running as fast as possible\nDuring the second year of my employment my first job after residency I met a woman named Pamela libel who is a family physician in Eugene Oregon\nAnd Pamela introduced me to this concept of micro practice and it immediately blew my mind and it was three months later that I opened the practice how was the transition how did that occur [noise]\nIt was a fanatic time so contacting insurance companies requesting a contract reviewing the contract filling them and with all of my\nDegrees and board certifications and malpractice insurance data\nAnd all of that so it's just a lot of paperwork yeah that normally physicians don't ever see because all they do assigned the bottom line and and uh a very helpful administrative person is gathered all of that for them\nIt seems like a short amount of time given all the stuff that you'd have to set up and you had to find a location and you know I even have to hire anybody but um but you didn't have to figure out how you were going to do all the all the jobs so to have in\nMind that location designed space by medical equipment the office was a a fell into place I found it on Craig's list and it's half a mile from my home and it's been a quiet corner northeast Portland it's just I I Love my location that's awesome\nHow does your colleagues react when you told them I'm leaving this practice and I'm going to start my own practice in this sort of unusual way it's it's not spoken in medical\nTraining but there is this sort of um subliminal\nCurriculum that tells you you could never do this on your own it's way too complex and\nWhat I felt and what I've verified is that it doesn't have to be I see fewer patients per day but for me it makes my practice more sustainable it keeps me in love with practicing medicine and keeps me engaged with my patients instead of looking past them or\nFeeling rushed to complete a ten minute appointment so what is it typical day like for you I see my first patient at ten\nHave a two hour administrative break from twelve to one of those days per week I meet with my ministry of assistance who's relatively new addition and who works remotely\nUm and I see an average five to seven patients each day\nCan you can you walk me through sort of a typical appointment like it it starts not with the waiting room right there's no waiting room because there's\nPretty much no waiting unless somebody arrived early to their point in it so I only see one patient or family\nW ... members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nFor their visit a after we've talked for a little bit we go into the examination room where I perform and physical exam and then we return to the sitting area and I write a prescription or order lab results are disgusted planned whatever it might be with them\nAnd so did you start out doing all of this by yourself you said now you've got an administrative person when you start out doing absolutely everything I started out doing absolutely everything with the exception of book keeping my partner does the bookkeeping for the business\nAnd that also gave us an opportunity to have a small group which allowed us to purchase our own health insurance\nAs a group rather than in as individuals and so what was it like the first year what did you think about going back I never thought about going back I really enjoyed this particular style of medicine if someone calls me in the middle of the night with\nA health related emergency I Know who they are now I have a sense of their medical history it's not one of two thousand it's one of\nFour hundred something instead which is much more manageable\nHow long are you spending with each of your patients in a new patient visit is usually sixty to Ninety minutes\nI'm a follow up visit is thirty to forty five minutes a well child check is forty five to sixty minutes\nIn previous practices and in most practices it's a luxury to spend twenty minutes at a well child check\nAnd I understand from your website that you are not taking any new patients I I Do have the waitlist it's about six to nine months on average right now I Can't see a lot of new people each week because that would\nInterrupt the availability of same day an urgent need appointments for my existing patients but with this sort of moderated growth it's working really well do you sometimes wish that you could see more people\nI'm pretty happy with the pace of things as it is it's certainly not get rich quick schemes [laughter] I'm In fact I Would caution many physicians who might be ... that you will take a significant pay cut so who covers for you when you go on vacation\nI have a few colleagues in the area and the five of us sort of help each other out when we go on vacation in fact I was on call for Dr Hudson last week it's obvious how this is better for patients um tell me a little bit more about\nWell I get to sleep in [laughter] that's a really wonderful tired of my quality of life right now is that they don't have to get up at five thirty in the morning to be\nAt the office at seven to start seeing as many patients as possible all day long the hours are a blessing to me and again the intimacy with my patients and how well I get to know these families\nReally makes my job a pleasure and sustains my interest in love of medicine are there are there downsides for you I think that the downside potentially is isolation that I don't have a colleague in the office next door\nTo say hey what do you think about this case or can you can look at this fast for me what do you think about this which I Do miss you said that that that this is kind of reflective of your personality is that is that anger and I've been told that I started saying that I wanted to do it all by myself around age two and never stops [laughter]\nSo it really clearly suits me very well oh\nThat's Dr ... she has a micro practice in Portland, Oregon we have some links to

listeners that's a good thing thanks much for your help\nJohn be when has reported on race for much of his career but events in two thousand sixteen\nHim thinking to you about reporting on race with a slightly different framework first John attended an anti racism workshop in January of two thousand sixty for two days he was a Merced in discussions about race and racism then there were all the race related events of that year\nRacial injustice police incidents the presidential race Johnson\nLargely because John wasn't feeling confident he could report the stories accurately well I Wonder why John question to themselves well I Do\nThink I think why people are a little suspect as experts on white as I think that we have a culture that\nI'm overwhelmingly tries to tell\nA glossed over story about ourselves tenacity coats talks about the dream a and at that white folks are kind of walking around in a in a dream which is the story of what a wonderful country we are the people who look like us made and\nSo it's not easy to just to see outside that that dream or that bubble if you will to use another metaphor\nJohn says you can hear that bubble in a lot of reporting he says just listen for how people are identified\nAnd noticed that a lot of times in in our reporting we will mentioned that someone is black or Latino or Asian or Native American if they are but white people we we we don't with that's just a person\nYou know we said Joe ... is a plumber who lives in this town in Ohio now if if that person's black it's for one thing it's very likely going to be part of the story that they're black\nBut we don't do that with white people and that's a\nThis is one of the things that people who think more deeply about whiteness point out is that they call it unmarked this or that whiteness is sort of treated as the default it's the that you're just a person if your way and then and and and it's non white people who have race\nSo John we'll flip that on ... on its head\nThe next ten episodes obscene on radio will be all about the white race and white is\nNo on ... it's a critical look at white dominated society with stories about the origins of race a town that has forgotten the racial cleansing that took place there and northern innocence the idea among whites in the northern us that the south has more to answer for [noise]\nI Am really looking forward to

something that would be my by my side with Hellmann's ashes and so\nI knew she will love that because she always used to do some ... ... my work she used to be the quality control manager and she always looked at over age ... magnifying glasses and you point out any laws that may be in the blade\nSo I figured you would consider that there'll be part of me she would really want to have that
