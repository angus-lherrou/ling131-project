being it and the middle of the night and it's like stripping the pain of my porch and I'm thinking about the stories that we tell ourselves and how random everything is and how random\nFor innocent children every day all over the world\nAnd earlier I connected the dots and I told myself a story that saved his life and got him to the hospital and it got him treatment at a time when he could have died\nAnd then later on in all the agony and the fear and the despair and the guilt I told myself another story and I connected the dots in another way that made me to blame\nAnd it's like why do we tell ourselves these stories and why does so many of our story slip into those stories\nAnd I realize the only control I had over the situation my own personal San trivia was to let go of the story that I needed to tell myself and live more like Emily had said in our town to realize life every every minute\nAnd when I woke up the next morning it was like a parade\nAnd beautiful and clear winter day and Ella started talking about the black bird and I'm like let's go to the playground and we went outside and it was a beautiful day and I said you know what\nLet's eat this day let's eat it like takes just perfect day who knows how many of them were going to get\nAnd take it inside you much chew it and let's swallow it so that we can have it for later and it can always be with us and we started to eat the day my family\nAnd one day a little walked in you know to the boys' room and she's like that not gone and already knew that and I was gone because I felt it and I felt this dark spirit lifts from our house when I stopped connecting the dots\nI thought about the only other line that I remember from our town something I always thought was so beautiful and I think about it every time I Try to tell a big story and I realized what we really need most often her just postcards just moments\nAnd there was a beautiful moment in our town before Emily died and found herself in a cemetery when she was falling in love and somebody sent a postcard to her fiance to be a little sister and I think of it address to my son line is\nAnd it goes Linus Redmond three sixty four

dark cloud and you always have to be vigilant but I think it really taught the entire family to just appreciate what we have and don't look to find the future um and be incredibly grateful\nYou know you were telling a story about appreciating every moment of life and actually all the stories told him the graveyard that were really about the\nThe graveyard as a venue to tell this story about the appreciation of life but it does it make a richer\nI I think that well number one I'm southern so you know graveyards have a huge place in our culture it's like you tell stories and graveyards you make out in graveyards and so it seemed perfect telling my story and a graveyard\nBut I'm One of the things about having a baby that's diagnosed with cancer you know he was only three months old when he was diagnosed as you are stripped of the illusion of this Seventy six Seventy eight years of life being real you realize front and center we are all born to die\nAnd there's just no more illusion about it you know he didn't do anything to cause this it's just this is what's coming for every single one of us\nSo telling the story in the graveyard and sort of like celebrating my son's life and
