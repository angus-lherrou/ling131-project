far\nHere than live at the [noise] [noise]\nMy mom has a nickname for me uh bought in Cantonese it means busy body curious always asking questions kind of guy negative connotation and I had to suppress\nThat curiosity asking all of those questions because when you're born a kid of immigrants you're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on\nKeep your head down learn English\nGo to school get good grades go to college Mary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kids by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them because I was born and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which was bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me my\nMom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brother's a take turns massaging his back\nWhile\nAll of this I'm also trying to

must have been so important and if he had brought all of these groups together\nSo my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching the documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points this green she looks ... photo and says\nThat's your family what I have all these questions\nWho is he how is he relayed isn't easy like a cousin because another cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met him because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two but I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish\nIn her eyes she didn't look like he had wanted to tell me this much I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how could I\nAbout a murder man and our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking of articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all\nThe New York public library branches and I can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily Vincent ... mother little each in ... when all over the nation on the Phil Donahue show crying out I Want justice for my son\nShe's featured at her house in the suburbs of the choice feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes trying to set up the filmmakers of boyfriends\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue toy Sonny's\nSome moments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because this woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was rally\nBut nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself\nI have to find out who will each in is because if lowly chin is indeed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family\nA someone who spoke up\nTo be a spot again to be a busy bought a curious and be proud of that you know\nSo now I'm like I have to find out who will each in and and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer the city where Vincent Chin lived and died Detroit\nAnd I take an eight hour mega bus to Detroit my friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery ... grave\nWe she drives us\nAnd we find Vincent ... name on a tombstone lowly chains name on the tombstone ... husband's name on a tombstone\nThey're no longer goals\nThere right below my feet\nAnd I'm finally going to know how these people are related to me and why this means so much to me\nI go\nThe next day to my relatives
