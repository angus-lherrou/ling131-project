spoke the spoken language was French ... law [noise] uh the letters um [noise]\nUh I never knew what the court was about because when they we received a letter in English they received each other's letters in English\nThey then would respond to the letters verbally in French ... so I couldn't understand French ... and I was never shown the letters but only I knew\nA certainly from my mother's side the reaction of the letters um this was incredibly uh interesting to me ah everything my mother did was interesting to me I I'm a door to her but mostly what I adored about tours that she adored me [noise]\nUh [noise] so I liked to see her angry or it was interesting to me to see her angry in speaking in this language which I had no interest in learning at all uh because in any case

years but this this is first time on stage with the mob mob stories or person off in fact stories told on them off stage are most times the most important most defining stories from a person's life\nHere Sebastian on crafting a story\nYou know I Do a lot of public speaking and I'm used to sort of talking and explaining how things work [noise]\nAnd then I started to understand that that's not what the law\nYou're really doing is telling a story\nTo understand something more deeply [noise]\nThe story that you're about to hear includes images of war and it's not too difficult for children I was told at a mosque night called I Witness stories from the front line here [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I uh\nI grew up in a wealthy suburb\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables and I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man\nI didn't feel like I was a man I thought war would be a exciting\nAnd intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pens and a few thousand dollars I went to\nBosnia during the civil war Sarajevo to try to learn to be a war reporter and war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not disappoint but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body\nIt wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people die and wars are civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war\nIt was a girl's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm\nTaken by surprise military forces\nAre and ... they took her up to a field above a town called ... and ... they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat\nAnd what I saw her it was a couple of weeks later of summer it was hot and it's the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails\nAnd that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm [noise]\nRemember the first time I got ready to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines and it was\nA goat getting pretty bad out there and I tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really weren't good for much and then another couple of journalists and we were driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebels step by step out of the jungle in front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead\nAbout whether to kill us and ...\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was numb\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt at all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole that the bullet comes out of you know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot another guy grab the barrel instructed off I knew it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us I thought what does it turn it inside those holes and there are so small the thickness of a pencil and attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us\nAnd we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze in combat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave\nHave you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd it's\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um I just say it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against them sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you so much that you for five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you ask yourself am I getting shot at because the sound the bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives a moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then it everything goes crazy well the bullet\nThe bullet a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt what's the angles\nThat gives you two inches to the right now what's the mass on that angle\nYou don't even want to think about it um\nAnd then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nBullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking and everything I was paralyzed by some sandbags and our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bullet proof vest we're getting a tax on three sides they're coming up and to the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire\nAnd I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there he finally jumps across that gap any graphs Sufi\nThrows my camera to me so it was my bullet proof vest grabs his stuff is throwing amateur soldiers does the soldiers are pinned down to\nAnd it gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously very very brave a\nLot of braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nAre free to love each other on reserve Italy without it being mistaken for something else\nThat was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary about this little outpost we were going to call every struggle and we were going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot\nOn this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Phillies on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of have a lot So Tim took the next trip\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed five American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American physicians got overrun they drag off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there\nWorse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all of that same broke his life he's a ten thousand feet up in the car with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long\nAnd says well it's broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain bike daughter we are going to get hammered here's two Advil\nAnd Tim new Jim knew that if you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out there and he did it I don't know how but he did it he got down on that mountain\nSo we finished up our deployment\nAnd um that's how we started to think of it are deployment I'm and I'm not you know rest of his obeying the worst was in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um", "year": "2018",
