[noise]\nSo um I you know as a Red Sox fan and a lifetime Red Sox fan you know there's there's a lot of ah there's a lot of pain associated with that [noise]\nRight so let's go to two thousand and one my friend Lou has landed an incredible job is chief marketing guru for the New England patriots now the New England patriots at the time are also another tragic bad luck teen bad ownership\nBad teams bad stadium the whole nine yards just awful\nAnd he's working for them or\nIn that role and they're building a new stadium in two thousand and one and they're trying to turn the whole franchise around with new ownership and whatnot\nSo I go and visit him and he says hey do you want to take a tour of the new stadium and I'm like sure so we put on the hard hats were jumping the golf cart and we drive out to the stadium and the big they built a new stadium right next to the old one so we're right there\nSo he sort of go we're going around and he's pointing to what's going where and ... you know all these funky new age things that are going on and all of a sudden we hear this big crash and and banging and we look up in this whole bunch of staging is falling on top of us\nI dive out of the way he's not so lucky you write I jumped up he's on the ground as blood everywhere well a big to buy for these huge six inch nails came down and it went right through his hand into his neck\nSo I'm screaming construction workers were everywhere we call you you know the ambulance comes\nThey take 'em to the hospital I follow the ambulance to the hospital and you know that the emergency room doctors take the nail out they say he's very lucky he could have bled to death an inch or two either way and he asked the emergency room doctors for the now\nAnd so you know a few weeks later after he's recovered were out with a bunch of friends who were joking around\nThe now and he's like I just wanted to remember how lucky I was so we named lucky ... and so we're hanging out and were were drinking and we go out all the time and he's like what if what should I Do with a nail and we're trying to come up with some ideas so I'm like\nHow about if you try and give some of that good luck to you have to the New England patriots why don't you go hide the nail in the stadium and he's like\nThat's stupid enough that it might war that sounds like fun I'll go do it so he has access to the stadium he goes and he hides the the now in the stadium and then two thousand and one the patriots the first four games go one and three\nAnd were you know he's like yeah the stupid now and then all of a sudden the patriots go on an unbelievable run and they win the Superbowl so we're like hey the down were joking around like two jerks right and so now two thousand and two rolls around\nAnd they're in the news that it's the first time in the new stadium and they're going to demolish the old stadium so he goes and takes the nail out of the old stadium and they demolish it and he leaves the nail on his desk for the two thousand and two season the patriots don't even make the soup that don't even make the playoffs\nSo two thousand and three rolls around he's like you know what I'm going to put the nail in the new stadium see what happens\nAnd I'm like yeah I think that's a great idea so two thousand and three of the patriots go to in to the first four games then they go on this unbelievable historic run\nAnd they win the Superbowl so we're like\nAre you kidding me and so he's like I'm leaving the now until something until they sisters unbelievable and so I give them this look because my brain is not working\nRight and he knows and he looks at me he goes why and it's that I have an idea looking I'm like obviously the now his magic\n[noise]\nAnd my mom does that my name\nAnd so I'm going to go to the bank\nAnd to bother the cast is our bank account and because um I had alliances with\nMy mother you know I didn't tell my dad about the money because I knew if I did he would say that it was his and um I just listened to her and I just I took to eight thousand dollars of cash in my back on on my back outside on the street had never done that before and um\nAnd I deposited the money for her and I was too stupid to take a ... for myself I'm which\nReally should have and I would today if it happened again um [noise]\nThe rule was awesome it was like I put a bed skirt on the bed and I had the left up pillows and it was like a class a motel room and there was like ten feet of space from the wall to the end of the bed it was like unprecedented gorgeous bedroom and the first thing my dad did when he came home and he saw that clean open\nHe started to take out all the little piece of paper from his pocket and he went to the kitchen and he got his files he used to keep files and like run and boxes and he just let them in tiny piles all over the bedroom floor\nAnd at that moment my heart just think and I but I didn't say anything because I don't know I didn't say anything and I kept cleaning and the next day I was cleaning the kitchen and I was throwing up like the three year old mayonnaise and I was you know\nThrowing out the Taco Bell south packets in all the takeout personality and I am the plastic bags that were like in piles of you know shopping bags in the corner and I remember the moment where I was scrubbing the floor I was on my hands and knees and my dad was at a higher level than me because he was seated at the kitchen table\nAnd we got into a fight because I was really upset about the bedroom and I said I'm I said I said dad\nI'm doing this for you and doing all this cleaning for you and then the meanest coldest voice he said\nI didn't ask you to do that and you know at that\nTime I was too young and too angry to realize that there was really so much pain behind those words and so you know I just went back to college and I was like\nYou and I didn't think about him and I didn't call him and he was all alone and everybody in his life had left him and I didn't care but\nUm I've come to realize that your physical space is a reflection of your mental spiritual an emotional state and no matter how much they tried to clean in that house it was always going to come back\nBecause there was so much tied to it it was like my parents fear their resentment their anger their hatred and until they were ready to confront that with each other and for themselves I could never clean up my parents not thanks [laughter]\nTo see a picture about and you can visit the website\nAnd while you're there we'd love to hear

car up out of the gas station out among the blueberry farms in my hometown in Canada and I'm late and I'm way past curfew because I've been helping my girlfriend climbing through her window [noise]\nAnd so I got to get home and so I'm I finished coughing up the car and I'm leaving this gas station I look down the road it's all clear and I make my turn and suddenly there's this horrendous metal crushing noise and I'm not hit from the front and I'm not hit from behind it emanates from underneath the car\nAnd the car lifts and stops\n[noise] so I opened the door and I get out and it's a long way down\nAnd when I look under the car I see of actually managed to Stonehenge my father's Pontiac Acadia in on a Boulder\nThe boulders that lead to the exit of the gas station I turned about twenty feet shy of the road and I'm perched and I hear the gas jockeys show nice why\nYou're a smart what are you [noise]\nHow am I going to explain this out where I Lived out there and those farms like if you don't have a car you don't have a life\nI just got my life I'm not letting these boulders take my life [noise] and the gas jockey says\nI'll get a tow truck which is going to take my life\nSo I just get in the car and I do the only thing I Know how to do I start it and I jumped the collection the gas\nAnd I'd balance and it catches and somehow I launched a Pontiac Acadia an off of Boulder [noise] and I'm Free but\nI didn't notice that there was another row of boulders across the law which I then cleared [noise]\nThat export morning my father wakes up and he goes out to work and

eighties hair out of my eyes my Nineteen eighties ... over but my independence had just begun I just needed more practice that's all I kept telling myself\nSo one night at about two in the morning I'm crawling home in first gear from this party because I'm looking for the turned to my parents street and I can't find it I don't know why it just seems really foggy for this time of year and I see the turn and I make it and the car\nDescends into this ditch and\nIt doesn't even touch the bottom it doesn't even touch the water I just literally parked my father's car on the banks of a dish like a mole on a face and I got out\nHow am I going to explain this like if I crashed my father's car at fifty miles an hour I Would have been normal but crash your father's car at two miles an hour\n[noise]
