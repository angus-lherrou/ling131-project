I may have to Still Alice is leftover if you're a fan of Presley but\nAfter those were sent off I started thinking about the reception\n[noise] I don't like the smell of flowers they give me a headache I decided to make all of our center pieces\nButtons from his family and my family I made my weddings okay I created flowers from pieces of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom's wedding veil\nAnd he went along with all of this [laughter] she actually went with me to thrift stores picking out all the mix matched vintage plates we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little talk first for the twelve cakes we were going to have is twelve I'm a big believer in cake so [noise]\nHe cared about to mostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle he composed it and orchestrated it and send it off to the bans and we got prepared for our big day it's going to be so beautiful like an anthropology catalog threw up over everything but [noise]\nThat's what I wanted [laughter]\nWe got married on April twenty four which is my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years when the day of my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring us the same good luck\nAnd we were married outside St Louis Missouri in a town called crease core which is his home town and his sister's back yard\nSo on April twenty fourth we hung all of the twinkling lights and the trees decorative little stars put out tables in my beautiful center pieces and on every seat laid down a custom made played bell I had done for the event\nNow all of this preparation he failed to mention that April in Missouri is tornado season [noise] I was actually watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins and to the shapes of swans when the tornado siren\nWent off and then came the rain and then hail\nAnd wins and it knocked all of the table over and all of my beautiful center pieces into the mud six months of making them every night\nAnd they were destroyed no one saw any of it\nLuckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter]\nThat's the only time that's lucky by the way up\nWe had invited all of these circuits people so we had trapeze artists and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do the pitch a tent so up with a big ... and we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made got my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trashed\nRabbit was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't get in the little card I made so we just proceed without her [noise]\nUm [noise] I was looking forward to the song\nHadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play it because the bandleader had a heart attack [noise]\nFine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing it without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nFavorite show so um [noise] the\nPhotographer had never shot a wedding before so she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some guy showed up and apparently brought a stomach virus that I had not registered for um [noise] so throughout the day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies\nAmongst all of this the worst part for me was that my dad decided not\nTo come I didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle and so he said I'm not going to be there I have a stepfather that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself\nBut he didn't like it and so he chose not to come to my mom called them I called them and he said well I send a check\nAs if that's the same thing\nI'm is only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding and that will always be true but I Can't do a father and daughter dance by myself\nSo I I danced with his dad my grandfather and as we weighed beneath the big talk he looked at me and said your dad should have been here\nAnd he showed them and then\nMaybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise]\nAll of our hamburger spiders just went up in flames [laughter] but\nHe also missed the double rainbow that came out after the storm is\nFinally passed by and he missed our friends singing a song from ... to do and and also has to pay and jump around [noise]\nSo after all it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle\nThe cocktail I have made [laughter] which is just jak and coke\nBut [noise] in fact it was our\nAnd the family that showed up for us\nAfter all the details don't make the day and they don't make the marriage either because I'm not married anymore and I don't\nThink the perfectly sunny day and matching escort cards would have changed that\nWe shouldn't have gotten married there's some things even take can't fix [noise]\nMaybe if I hadn't been so caught up in all of the preparations I Would have realized that but there are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happens after the big day is over\nBut\nEven though it began with the storm it didn't end with one we were married increased corps which literally translates to broken heart and my dad says now [noise] [noise] well it looks like I didn't miss anything anyway\nBut he did\nHe missed a part of my life\nAnd he also missed our friend and a meatloaf cover artist called pot roast um\nIt was also are videographer\nSinging karaoke in the garage well all of our friends stamps and the pedals\nSo he missed a lot\nYou would think that with all this I Would sort of be sick of weddings I mean they're people who think they are a scam but I Love weddings I Love the details and stuff and I just became a wedding planner\n[laughter] I've married about twenty five couples and they've been no tornado that any of them they've all been beautiful had perfectly detailed days\nI've added

our\nPartners K. and damages here's Christian we live in Mexico\nTo bright spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trail with my partner but if he's just ahead of me on the path and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now\nHave this do you want to have a baby silence he turns around and I see that he has laughing at me this is the stupidest\nIdea you've ever had no I don't want to have a baby\nIn his defense or we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while\nI'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of Haley an Riley had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just trying to get that taste of freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth to a baby a this\nAnd uh I'm just transgender ah for me that means that I was born female [noise] um I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling a feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nA and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant that um I could stay alive a and I could transition and I could be happy\nUm which is what I did um [noise]\n\nUh I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\nUh\nAnd it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby [noise]\nUh and we'd known dozens of other stringent our men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to have the beautiful children we knew it was possible or but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and this was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am\nI'm but I uh live in a world of rainbows end unicorns ah and I just hope that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer\nI'm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a and a few months went by nothing happened um and I started that thing maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all\nAnd just when I started to feel peaceful about that\nI woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\nAh [noise]\nI had read all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time\nAnd so I refuse and he's a pregnancy test and then just made me and I took it and there were two lines and I was pregnant and it was going to be a baby you know dogs [laughter] but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for a baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of the baby [noise]\nI'm Haley and why we have been toddlers when they came to live with us so I didn't know what to do with a baby um and then my body started to change really quickly I'm an all of those ah markers of femininity in everything just got bigger everywhere\nAnd I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on in my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like this are my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do\nOr I could get excited about the things that I can do that their buddies camp which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just let everything else go\nOh and wait around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly\nUm and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out as friends um because our lives our misery says the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes there is hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color\nBut for all of us there is also joy and love and and resilience and family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready um and we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say like go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone's do with that um CNN a Washington Post people magazine\nPregnant man and I thought that maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "city": "Brewster", "day": "23"}
