at the same time\nTo not two thousand two as you remember what the wild west days of the Internet or there was no Twitter there was no YouTube very few people were on Facebook so it was really really hard to go viral back then uh and I say that so you'll be impressed [noise]\nSo and you have to do I was a college student at the University of Maryland and um it was a really hard time in my life I was sad\nAll the time uh and I was tired all the time and I didn't really make any friends on campus I just went to class and I didn't join in the activities I just occasionally were writes um movie

next story if I have special ed teacher we first met any ... not far\nHere than live at the [noise]\n[noise]\nMy mom has a nickname for me uh bought in Cantonese it means busy body curious always asking questions kind of gotten negative connotation and I had to suppress\nThat curiosity asking all of those questions because when you're born a kid of immigrants you're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on\nKeep your head down learn English go to school get good grades go to college Mary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kids by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them because I was born and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which is bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me\nMy mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brothers would take turns massaging his back\nWhile\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America American and so I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and if the U.S versus China and I asked\nWho are re rooting for [noise]\nI don't go well of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought I couldn't ask that\nThough because when you're a\nThat's tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause a ruckus right but\nMy way to figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen I was so excited to watch a PBS documentary about becoming American the Chinese experience [noise]\nPeople that I've seen three people who ever looked\nLike me Jackie Chan trainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAnd live on a cartoon character [noise]\nSo I'm so excited to watch these last twenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who looked like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all of these people will go on the street and risk their identities their life they were marching for this man named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen\nEighty two was a Chinese American man who was beaten to death\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers crisis in Detroit where Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their jobs\nThey fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest wants his funeral and said the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served the day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Philippine X people\nAre now saying if this could happen to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American I never heard that term before and Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together so my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching this documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and\nTens photo and says that's your family\nWhat\nI have all these questions who is he how is he related to ... like a cousin of a cousin of the cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met him because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish and her eyes\nThat she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me this much I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how can I ask\nAbout a murdered man in our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking at articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and they can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily Vincent ... mother ... ... all over the nation on the Phil Donahue show crying out I Want justice for my son\nShe's featured at her house in the suburbs of Detroit feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes China set up the filmmakers of boyfriends\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue toy Sundays at some\nMoments during the documentary you could see little each in trying to hold back hurts hears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because of this woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was rallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself I have to find out who will each in is because if little each in is in the my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family of someone who spoke up\nTo be a spot again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that\nYou know so now I'm like I have\nTo find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer the city where Vincent Chin lived inside Detroit\nAnd I take an eight hour mega bus to Detroit my friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery ... grave\nWe she drives us\nAnd we find Vincent ... name on a tune stone lowly chains name on the tombstone ... husband's name on a tombstone they're no longer goals\nThere right below my feet and I'm finally going to know how these people are related to me and why this means so much to me\nI go the next day to my relatives house we're eating swelled dishes of meals I'm looking through thirty photo albums with my family I see pictures of my mom and dad with matching terms in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAsked my relatives can you help me make a family tree I Want to know more about my family so we start with my grandmother's line my grandmother had a brother and nine sisters the second sister on this list is slowly chin\nSo now I Know lowly chin is my grandmother's sister lowly chin is my mother's first aunts and Vincent Chin is my mother's first cousin so I asked my eighth grade ... who what happens to lowly after Vincent Chin died\nA few years after this story morally moved out of New York city and back to Colorado where she got a place with a lot more than they do she got
