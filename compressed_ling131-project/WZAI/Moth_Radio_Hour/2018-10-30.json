an ordinary twenty it's made up of to queens apart screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts and as soon as I saw that hand hit the table I thought maybe\nUm everything's going to be All right\nNow I used to go carts for a living and I was taught to do that by a group of friends mentors or who were some extraordinary people very brilliant very poised prosperous and sort of beautiful in a way and they are incorporated me into a blackout\nTaught me how to go into casinos and when my and my job was to go in and when\nAnd would they eventually figure it out with something I already

[noise] I rent them off during some fine fine [laughter]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy\nSuburb I spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man and I thought war would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pens and a few thousand dollars and I went to Bosnia during the civil war is are able to try to learn to be a war reporter and war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not disappoint\nBut it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body it wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people dying mores of civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war\nIt was a girl's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken by served paramilitary forces are and ... they took her up to a field above Italian go to a record\nAnd they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat\nAnd what I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summers hot and the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails\nAnd that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm [noise]\nI remember the first time I got ready to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out at the front lines and it was a ... getting pretty bad out there and I try to get back to\nSierra Leone and soldiers who really were good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebel ... step out of the jungle in front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd ...\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was numb and I didn't\nHave any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see\nThe little black hole that the bullet comes out of you know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot and another guy grab the barrel instructed off I knew was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us I thought what does it turn to the inside those holes and they're so small the thickness of a pencil and attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us\nAnd we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze in\nCombat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave have you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd ...\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty mayhem physician up on this rich are getting attacked all the time\nAnd I'm at this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against some sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoes that you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you asked yourself am I getting shot at because the sound of bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle\nYes I Am getting shot at and then it everything goes crazy well the bullet the bullet a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt\nWhat's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right\nWhat's the mass on that angle you don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about\nWell I was paralyzed bullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking and everything I was paralyzed by some sandbags our gear was ripe right over there just a few feet away cameras bullet proof vest\nWe're getting a tax on three sides they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire\nAnd I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there\nHe finally jumps across that gap and he grabs Sufi throws my camera to me it goes by bullet proof vest the grabs this stuff is throwing amateur soldiers does the soldiers are pinned down too\nAnd he gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously very very brave a\nLot of braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men are free to love each other on reserve Italy without it being mistaken for something else\nThat was Tim and that's why we were working together\nWe decided to make a documentary about this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we're going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot on this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I when I asked for my ... on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of ... So Tim took the next trip\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded at one point um the American positions got overrun they ...\nIn the middle of a firefight they got him back but it was bad out there way worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of\nAll that same broke his leg is it ten thousand feet up in the car with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long and the medic examines his foot and says well it's broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by daughter we are going to get hammered\nHere's two Advil\nAnd Tim new Jim knew that if you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty man you shouldn't be out there and he did it I don't know how but he did it you got down off the mountain\nSo we finished up our deployment\nAnd um that's how we started to think of it are deployment um\nAnd er nothing you know the rest of his okay the worst was in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "30"}
