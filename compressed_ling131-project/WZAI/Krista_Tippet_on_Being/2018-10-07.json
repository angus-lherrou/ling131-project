way each individual life\nIs it's on my end to this question is you know what what does it mean to be him and I'm asked to know that that every one of our sense of that is constantly evolving process life but there's some things you said about writing I signed signed tree gang\nI feel like the way you've written about them is how writing forms you as a human being I read somewhere um it's an endeavor I go into that now provide solid deep joy perhaps disjointed from writing seated comfortably in my court because\nHas shown me what happens with patients and someplace else you wrote the surprises I've experienced in my writing practice have dislodged me from curiosity into love\n[laughter]\nI Wonder if you could say a little bit about those qualities and other way into the question of what you've you're learning about what it means to be human through the legs and usually\nI'm I think the writing practice um it was something that I had not expected\nTo be a good fit\nI had never thought oh I Want to be a writer one day\nBut I went to the Institute of American indian arts and um they didn't have a music program that's what I wanted to study [laughter] but I really wanted to go to school there so I felt like the next best thing was just study writing\nAnd um it was not easy a lot of uh I Would say the first three three and a half years I wrote some really really really bad bad bad poems like really dry it took me a long time\nBut I think it was that patients that is something I've learned through writing a sense of patients and their reward uh-huh that comes from that\nEven I'm just now thinking about the peace thirty eight but that piece for example took me\nI Want to say maybe a year and a half to two years to write but it was important to me it's kind of is an ethic piece it's like six pages long yeah [laughter] yeah yeah would you just\nBriefly say what what's happening in that piece\nIn thirty yeah\nBriefly in thirty eight it's a written to\nAnd for the ... thirty eight who were I'm thirty eight duck court to men who were Hong under the orders of a President Abraham Lincoln um as a result of this sue appraising\nWhich came at a time when the court to people\nAnd do as we're getting smaller and smaller and um and finally down to something like a ten mile tract and the people ... people do not have um hunting rights beyond that\nUh and basically um and they had no se a store\nCredit with the traders and so they were basically starving so there was an uprising\nAnd I'm as a result um these thirty eight men were hung and\nThen the court to people were moved west to South Dakota area in different um basically they lost their land\nAs a ... a legal mess execution in us history and yes and it happened the same week that President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation yes that is raised really don't know that free or we don't teach 'em [noise] yeah [noise]\nSo so you were just talking so this topic along this emerged to patients writing all of this\nAh absolutely I just think um that I learned through writing\nThe reward and the joy that comes out of just being really patient with a piece mhm and patient with yourself I think at least for me the imagination is something that I have to really respect like its", "show_name": "Krista Tippet on Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "07"}
