[laughter] and um it\nAlways does an sounding like a hallmark card but I have found it to be very powerful if you can find the right way to do it [noise]\nI'm Krista tip it and this is on being nearby Bush's co founder and former director of the center for contemplative mind in society she's just written a new book together with rum died walking each other ... conversations on loving and dying we spoke into that I'm Fifteen\nSo I Wonder how would\nYou start to describe what the spiritual background of your childhood of your life or early life\nWell my early life I was brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and this is right after the war and say the second world [laughter]\nTo be the war [laughter] and um [noise] there wasn't daycare so my mother would drop me off at the church and I'd go to mass every morning and then I just go right over to the school they were both across the street from us so I was in church every morning\nFor my whole childhood\nReally profoundly affected by it and felt that in some way or other we wanted to well first integrated into our own lives fully and then share it with others and so most of them are single and came back and wanted to teach\nJust with gold seen insurance sauce Bergen a number of other Buddhist teachers were there also be who became Buddhist teachers but when I came back two years later I was I'm pregnant and married and I had a child then so I couldn't when we first came back\nMeditation we still had the model of it being monastic\nAnd so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just no one could imagine [laughter] right [laughter] ah [laughter]\nSo but I was just as committed as everybody else\nTo finding a way to bring this into um our lives on the west so first I started a\nBusiness with my then husband John Bush and I was I eliminated change and yeah yeah I thought when I was most interested in a looming nations was integrating this sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who work there want it to learn to meditate but we integrated and ways into the business that would and body the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know\nIt's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more complicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but\nAt the time that was radical yeah so we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words\nAs you can appreciate [laughter] yeah\nSo I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood now where what you're making is wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the BCS and [noise]\nAnd at the same time the way in which you're doing it is helping everyone who's involved to wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years\nGoogle because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person more creative more able to ah bring their their whole self into work and to be able to grow\nFrom their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\n[laughter] right right [noise] that is a chef that is still a still has a long way to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture and ideals and and practicality is yeah\nThis story of searching such ourself\nFirst of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find that language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take yeah\nUh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemplative mind and he called up and well first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so\nHe'd been thinking for some time at Google that or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter]\nAnd um when Google my public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide but it was so man decided it was going to be bringing meditation and he said I posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help so I went out there and we talk to and we looked around and\nWhat we identified was that people ... employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise] had been in front of their screens most of their lives so um\nFiguring out what was going on there\nI suggested that we could offer the same practices but emphasized the practices that that more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and then a different way\nAnd so we called it of course and they came up with this great name since they're the big search engine search inside yourself\nAnd then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny Goldman who also is in bug guy or with us back all those yeah right right\nI'm asked him to uh give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and on the relationship between meditation and emotional intelligence he did that and then we posted in the course and in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up\nAnd since then you know over two thousand go lawyers around the world have taken the course and\nThere's a lot of talk now about\nBringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it helps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question anything it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing\nBut this is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down can calm quiet stable\nYou have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes you know really disturbing emotions rise but it needs to be taken to the next kind of level of depth in order for people to begin to\nQuestion right wire\nBut this course actually offers enough time practice and a teaching to help people do that\n[noise] I mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that if you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] yeah I mean this can be superficial and it can be abused like any like any spiritual practice like yeah political correctness um [noise]\nBut you know nearby something that really so intrigues me in um\nIn your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including ...\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has\nYou know has is faring noble lineage um [noise] you know it's what is um that is the tradition that has focused on this for health reasons of years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again is a very root of judgment character and will\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was what is that that is the intention right have yeah that is the end and that's just quite amazing\nAnd then in the seventies you had a somebody\nWho actually I had never heard of David McClelland yeah and William James hall mhm um who became a teacher to all these figures who have gone on especially in narrow science to this Ritchie David than Daniel Goldman cliffs Aaron mark Epstein\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker and they lose something in your work they just read you pull through\nAnd seeing that this contemplative impulse\nIs a kind of human tradition as much as it is in their religious traditions I'm In ... center Owen cs Lewis ... the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that forward for me and it's really crazy him\nSo much [laughter] I'm honored [laughter] then yeah but\nBut it's true when we started the center for can jump out of mind\nWe uh we're looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful and sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it started right\nAnd um we interviewed eighty people we identify this isn't Ninety six and seven so it was early but we kind of word of mouth heard and knew\nDaydreaming ... which researchers found that daydream is good for your brain [noise]\nI don't think we do as much of that [laughter] teaching these students also we\nAt the end of the day we did that the yoga and and a deep relaxation\nAnd um of course they weren't\nTo use their phones during the day [laughter] but it's [laughter] it's a dish of us in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done yoga class you know those vets like okay\nLet go and you drop into the floor you know\n[laughter] as soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brats fan and I saw these arm's reach out [laughter] for their phones and about lying\nDown [laughter] for far right they brought their phones in front of their face [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... what's the sack religious right [laughter]\nRight [noise] well okay so and you did I get off work has Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is pure and um but you also written about ...\nVery practical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about that yeah that's really ...\nYeah yeah um we devised that at Google loved that she put it in her magazine plus I'm I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um [noise] you just type out\nYour email either a response or in initiating email\nAnd then you stop takes a deep breaths follow your brass\nIn and out in and out and in and out and then you read the email\nAnd you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be agitated or angry or do you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion\nOr maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are\nWhat whatever we ask them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it there was a week and between the classes and so a week later they came back and I said how did it go\nAnd um they all said that was radical you know I'm ... and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what is that I picked up the phone\nRight [laughter] so you know I mean there we all know\nCuba call you know and so\nUh that's really helpful really helpful I wanted to go back for a minute 'cause I didn't answer your question about\nSocial justice activism really house yeah I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nYeah what what mindfulness compassion practices others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out or on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body\nAnd then notice what your anger is see it and recognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time [noise]\nHold a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because you're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it causes mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate equity and compassion for the situation\nYou're much more likely to both see\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it and communicate it we did a lot of\nWork with lawyers and judges and they lost everything about that I wanted to ask you about that is so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental\n[laughter] it's I mean we ... we laugh but it's yeah you know it's a date with lawyers worry that can they be as zealous advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes\nAnd what that means and what those judges men\nIs not eliminating wise discernment\nIt's eliminating pre judgment so that day judges are unbelievably overworked\nThey have so many people coming in front of them\nOther and they said you know some young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking that this was probably who he is and what he's done right\nAnd they can't not have that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff\nBut they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so just being there and really listening to which actually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and\nThey loved it oh yeah I just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it in about two to three seconds long kind of interesting\nRight like physically like what we experienced as a press about whether to yeah and also that you can that it can be a longer right which is all yes and meditate or have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there [laughter] you can do all of the yeah [noise]\nI'm Krista tip and dishes on being today with what his teacher mirror by Bush who works at the intersection of industry social hailing and diverse contemplative practicing\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice [noise]\nIt's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I have to say like for myself I have them and had many experiences across the ears on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise]\nEven a kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously gratifying right it can be on just transformative and now they're asleep and all this science about how good it is for us on these very basic biological levels and stress and all of that\nBut it's very hard\nTo create this habit and has been\nI have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise] you know I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my piece tapes which just seems so pathetic but yeah it's a it's a hard time yeah\nAnd I wonder um I Want to ask you this you work with so many different practices I mean are there is this something where you really do have to find a way that works for you yeah well at the center\nWe we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered you know we've had a Buddhist teacher\nAnd a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices brother David teaching Christian practices um someone doing to be chanting\nWe've done it that way and then\nInvite people to find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple practices like um mindfulness of breath and walking meditation right and mindful listening and so on\nAs an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate the begin to reshape the inner life\nAnd the benefits that comes from as you said I mean it's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation", "show_name":
