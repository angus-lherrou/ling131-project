Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally cone who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News she just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate\nSally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson he was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation the two of them had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who waited in a long line and they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThey were instead exhilarated\nIn the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagine that this was possible a true back and forth marked at once by bedrock different and goodwill and humor\nAnd a willingness to bring our questions as well as our arguments our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening Mm\nI'm Christian ship it and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the Denison theater in Missoula, Montana and was co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nSo you know as as I moved through two thousand sixteen um what started being clear to me kind of midway through that areas who ever won\nUm\nThe deep work that we were going to have to do as a society was about was human work about repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that had suddenly become on you know we could no longer not see it\nAnd that somehow that was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum taking some kind of stock in terms of how we got to this place and um\nYou know Sally you\nYou're a liberal like your credentials are from um\nThank you and I don't think [laughter]\nI've worked really hard I yeah\nThat you tell a story that I found very you know and you know how you you grew up\nAs a community organizer and you know if you said that you know right wing or is more than\nWant to brag but somebody at Twitter told you that you had some of the worst trolls on the Internet I mean I'm just saying that you know that you actually\nCalled a bunch of them up a dead there were so many interesting things about my trolls even the word\nWe choose trolls right that yeah um you know maybe she creatures who live under bridges in Iraq some very deep you Steve humanizing latch yes\nUm and I I'll\nI'll say I guess that there were two things that I took away the most um one was um no one thinks they're mean\nNo one thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just ... talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good\nBy mark and these trials didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or or cruel or unkind um\nAnd and in fact\nWhen I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of being called things I Can't repeat on public radio on line um and they're going through real hardships\nIn their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still\nUm no one thinks they're mean no one thinks their hateful no one wants to be hateful\nOkay what do we deal with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're ... well the only thing I was just saying that this was I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which right it's like right\nNow but still they were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and we've forgotten\nIt's ... or it could hurt you that they make you feel that way you were feeling and\nThey had the opportunity a lot of them apologized ... thanks but why did you then do it right and this sort of it has something to do with\nA lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\n... and so I mean there are studies that when people have to uh you know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly so there's this ...\nOf technology that then ... allows us to fuel the dehumanization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up\nYeah yeah yeah I'm ... so I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem right and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse I happen to have an opinion on the matter about\nUh I'm actually on us what I really think I'm curious do you agree with Eric is I I've come to think that\nAh that the left by and large uh\nIs nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity and Jack [noise]\n\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we can somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what like let's try to do both um but also from I think that point of recognizing that at least at the very beginning nobody we all have a habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other ... and\nWe all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people my liberal friday say oh they're game Trump supporters me that there are so bassist and they're so as long as ... I hate them [laughter] 'cause they're so hateful I hate it out I mean [laughter] [noise]\nAnd we blame the people for than expressing these use as though not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's\nIntentions to be good and assume I Try very hard in this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I tried very hard to assume I Try very hard to assume that you liked me\nIn spite of some of the\nFun in spite of some of the things I Know you've read in ... and ... and ... written and said about gay people\nI still don't assume you mean me uh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I I Want to believe the best in people and I seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best of me\nYou actually call that a daily spiritual practice fats is you know or I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught and one of their related dynamics developed this which is that the culture\nSo really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like Sam so but in a been a very particular and since you've said something\nI mean you said a lot of time that but a few years ago you you made a comment what you later really have said many times in many places I regret you said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes\nAnd um and there were goat was in it and yes and I've had to talk to my natural about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was to talk to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet that\nSomebody came through and it shouldn't be on ... asked Erick Erickson what us you know saying this has to do with repairing\nCivil discourse you know if it was totally made earlier that we sometimes in in when I did that it was I think two thousand nine\nAnd ... it was just I didn't know anybody but at a\nCouple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it with someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since um but the number of people who still bring it up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see this about the right\nActually our route several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes to their way ... and\nThe common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing point in this country where as long as their site is winning they don't share\nA and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like worker record on this but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious to the people in our city blocks\nTo the homeless people in our community when is just national politics from Washington is the ... everything everything subtract because none of us are in Washington I'm\nDon't look I think it's very ... to point just it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... it could be the solution right because we have to remember that before the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global\nEd segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that provincial as them that that especially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have been shaped\nLed to a a lot of my opium so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is that I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to have less and I think progressive should lead the way\nTo go first to like\nLook to the points that were making here or if there was a sign that said that professes\nUm that people can change and grow\nAnd in fact that is a core of progressive politics is that please don't stay where we've been as a country in the divisiveness of\nRacial segregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality we are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that that\nDidn't make it invites change in the country and in individuals and so if you if if your vision involves people changing and\nGrowing then you have to be able to literally practice what you preach and create space for people to change and will\nJoin us ... when you see this because I said something somewhere on the right that you know we've we've gotta\nWe've got to improve we can approve the others are we going to ... and I get a lot these days will that unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna and there's just this is absolutely use those ... lack of faith to believe the other side is capable of growing\nYeah I um I get it to 'em I still have friends and you know activists\nAnd organizers who feel like hate and and ... is one of the strongest tools in their toolbox um you know look I just I always returned to I'm One of my favorite quotes Martin Luther king quote and he says darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that yes\nA sense an argument their brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up and they pick aside and\nNo one's going to pick your side it's by definition and arguments or the other person you're arguing that there's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody\nLeaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else you have to be open to being persuaded yourself\nThese are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else is saying um\nThing about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological ah it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family\nThat whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we're such quick progress\nOn gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out of Mexican so [laughter]\nBut are there are studies that you know look kids to go to racially integrated elementary schools\n... grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh activities\nAnd after school programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other but then\nHas a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually that actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask as we um as we wind down which is if the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree right and that in fact uh\nWe really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a proposition\nIs that we we don't we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called ... in life\nThat if it is about also just learning to disagree better\nWhen we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally says I haven't learned to stop hating it and and\nAnd and Eric ... yeah you said some of them not what your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have\nIn can still be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us we're all sinners\nSo you have of what does shift what chef swept becomes possible what difference does it make\n[noise] I um\nHave had the experience myself of being unexpectedly kind in the face of people being cruel on line or off and seeing\nThe difference it makes in yourself him up for it and I feel better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it [laughter]\nUm but it and then as well mhm uh people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like maybe a\nI had the privilege of finding example after example I mean there are ... credibly powerful stories of people who were you know professional hate mongers or\nKids who were just saying nasty violent racist things and who the targets of that hate\nShowed kindness and generosity and transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people\nWho they hadn't been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of\nThe power of the burden that\nIn a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at the receiving end of more of the hate\nShould have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I I get that there are times where it feels daily ... and a man in some cases it's too much to ask but it's not like there's the long enough to laugh at us and the other hand this is where\nThose of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up yeah and also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in\nTreating people like they are all extraordinary and beautiful in equal\nAnd I I Am blown away by the difference it makes you know\nAlways struck um ... if it just riddle to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture that what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel and it's not the fall the circuit in the apple\nIs actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears the world God says it's not good for men to be alone that's the first bad loneliness and so many of us can cocked relationships and communities on line\nAnd we're still alone\nAnd then we get in our tribes are Republican conservative liberal progressive Democrat will that tribe then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle with the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more and more\nTo to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people and you know we went with a wife who has cancer and I know we're we're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are online are and not there are\nI'm more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related Lee\nThat we both began having these internal conversations um with having kids um that level of local and I don't mean to keep harping on local here there's not a digital just community physical real break bread community in ... in my book I Am a firm believer\nThat everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home and bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know um there's a there's a great Christian also rose area Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse and she writes to the Christian Community a lot\nThat you and there is no better community in America than the gay community\nWhere an unlocked door in a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we\nTo be sure with over there\n[laughter]\nHow Jesus ball hog\nAnd is it is\nWe under value in the twenty first century review community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be sold around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them\n[noise] I'm going to fit this is on being today with Eric Ericson and Sally [noise]\nOkay we could finish one minute early which would please something deep in my radio bones but I'd really like to get can we just keep going for five more minutes that are I don't know where to\nAttack um I don't know if this is uh just want to\nBring up with the two of you and in this room that very much on my mind if I was so happy we haven't talked about the White House tonight right just because we're so\nFixated road from Williams for really because there's more\nTo life and there's more to politics has more to us in politics\nAnd um some things that puzzles me a curious have with the two of you because you are in that world is that on so many of these things on which were so divided in which a lot of hate gets thrown around by the extremes which we allowed to define and frame of our important discussions",
