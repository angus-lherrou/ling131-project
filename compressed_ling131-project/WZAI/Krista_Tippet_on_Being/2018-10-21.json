yeah mhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah uh-huh you I'm\nAnd I'm strangers in their own land you're near the end you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal left and you write a letter to Louisiana friends on ours you say ... you know if if you imagine if Iraq if I had a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to a liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and in your letter to\nYour friends on the liberal left I just kind of humanizing and its provocative and a human way consider the possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nThat's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that we are products of our own experience you know\nAnd what if you grew up in the family um it's so many said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you didn't know that\nI'm OK what does that have been your experience and what if your dad's job how much you earn was the central fact of your life you know\nAnd what if it was a blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job no [noise] I think that there's something actually missing in the\nEntire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or ... people with different political views I went to a different social class and there is a lot of smearing on the left\nA at the blue collar class that that line very serious look we're the daily workers we're climbing the telephone pole to repair or telephone\nWe're [noise] who are you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each year and a I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of\nOld cocoon I've long been here as I Am and the kind of you know it's not only a contempt that really bothers me now whenever I hear it or see it um and that is buried to some degree\nBut there's a kind of a reluctance to to reach out it's as if on the left\nThere's a lot of good political will but it's gotten curled up in on ... and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said just wrong on\nInstead of reaching out to build coalitions as we're a big country not ruin like us I was like them\nWhat we need our sturdy coalitions and I think labor unions when the labor movement was much larger and um [noise] there there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft\nRight right look different colors yeah in in class who's got together natural way to connect the theory on each other and we're here yeah public school systems um but we're down on those [noise]\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year acquired of every one\nOf every one where a very yeah yeah of everyone and you go to a different regions and get to know people get first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully and listen to actively be immediate everybody should learn those skills and then go cross uh to uh see if we can rebuild does\nThat connective tissue\n[noise] I'm I'm sure people have said to you and I I got into this conversation myself that um [noise] this critique that there are all kinds of groups of people like ... like people of color\nStrangers in their own land in this country and there was this late right and I ... yeah yes and especially now yet again and it's when white people that you know the critique that white people wake up to this phenomenon when it's about other white people\nUm how do you have you work with that in your mind\nIt's true and I think it's a it's an important insight\nYes I I think it's an excellent point okay I mean for example the opiate addiction problem has has been oh now they're called a diseases of despair\nWhich is kind of a compassionate way crack epidemic with no yeah yeah oh whereas the crack epidemic in the inner cities which blacks ah wasn't it was criminalized designed like yeah yeah that's right now in worse [noise]\nSo and so it's a point that should be broadly received\nMhm [noise] so and when it draws closer suspend just such a big wonderful conversation I'm just kind of curious about that you say somewhere that\nThe English language doesn't give
