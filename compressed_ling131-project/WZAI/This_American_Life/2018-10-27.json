was tough to come home and\nI I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed I really miss my little brothers and my little sister and they were gone and I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember it used to follow those because I think it works both ways I think that we still have that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded\nWell how desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it\n[laughter] if only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me\nBut I mean they're people are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I I just couldn't\nI couldn't do it I was too shy and know a lotta times

room a chemistry set\nAnd I didn't remember that cake had hardly any dolls you didn't seem\nQuite as playful as other kids that I said that it just it more serious in general so mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nAnd Mm Mm\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had received us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember the part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face of hardship she said

that was right before I started writing this\nDiary remain other sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me\nOne thing is the lack of any

I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam\nAnd wash out will generate here comes out of them was on Capitol [laughter]\n\nWow [laughter] [noise]\nIt's interesting that you actually

and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel sure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] make amazing that you're in your prime

something and that's the thing is he right exactly [noise]\n\nFourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything\nSo along with it entirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there is so much\nGoing on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy of you know\nI'm not just a sixteen year old kid who is you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a gorilla test them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but\nI don't know I mean it was like maybe the maybe keeping a diary where one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe\nOther people in another kind of situation need to actually\nMake up a little fantasy yeah I think um\nI didn't have much anxious about being the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it was just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great was um\nI Wonder why the the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience of a million people with with getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing I mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and\nAnd I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect millions of people like how is that enough motivation you know just to have your petty little craft and your\nLittle family and your small little apartment\nIt just seemed pathetic\nAnd I mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want it for myself\nWhat you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at your thirty

you've gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like a story from this American Life now for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on the radio but this week's show have ... we had to put together another story using that same style\nWhich we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIt destroyed that an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nHave to
