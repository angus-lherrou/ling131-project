I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it'd be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten that much\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things about me I decided to find her\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I now\nI'm I'm a do you want to

and\nI I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed I really miss my little brothers and my little sister and they were gone and I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember used to follow those because I think it works both ways I think that we still hope is that did make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded and\nWell I was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it [laughter]\nIt's only you knew you probably wouldn't make but I mean that people are complicated now what I really wanted to spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I I just couldn't\nI couldn't do it I was shy and know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure that we're [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo you sort of talk to us instead so yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise] [noise] oh\n\nEvery time the subject for hard times come up on your settle hesitancy and Susan's with\nThe person I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't that exactly no\nIt wasn't until we been talking for hours that I realized what it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that had been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people\nAnd I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but um\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids loved me blah blah blah [laughter] but uh\nI Would be devastating if I heard anything different Mm\nAre parts of the past you don't want to go back to ... parts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nThe procedures in

did was try to play\n[noise] Mm Mm\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had to seem to us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember the part of Susan that she doesn't think about much her talking about in the face of hardship she said she mostly remembered side of my family but I just take for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that keep people lived differently than the way I laughed and that's what I decided I wanted for myself\nAnd you can try to return to childhood by looking at photos for visiting the old

getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything in the world including Jews go along with it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive to anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself\nWas so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this\nOf you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl or kiss him and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean\nMaybe the maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe\nOther people in another kind of situation need to actually\nMake up a little fantasy yeah I think um\nI didn't have much anxious about being the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it was just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great [noise] um\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people with with getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions\nWon't affect millions of people like how is that enough motivation you know\nJust to have your petty little craft and your petty little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nYou know it just seemed to [noise]\nAnd I mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself what you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old [laughter] just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah [noise] he would be very very disgusted\nTo see her this this radio days [noise]\nIt would seem like I had settled pathetic way\nThese days staff writer for the new\nBoy when we were

would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like story from this American Life now for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on the radio but this week show have ... we had to put together another story using that same style\nWhich we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIs history that an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nTuft university is it pretty street

guess basically got up on a on the back and he started yelling and screaming about how he was a magnificent he\nAnd uh [noise] I think actually right after that I might have gone back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter] and uh I guess that really struck a chord of effort that was pretty amazing [noise]\nUm\nThey bought a lot about it um [noise] it actually good for me [laughter]
