GBH each T. three eighty nine points southern boy\nOn line at Cape and islands dot org serving the ... the ... and the island\nIt's a school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training they were running to first drill in the school building with a gun French and the boxes [noise]\n\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district um rural Ohio there's that his record on the condition that we not see their name on the air the date people on this team only to teachers all do it for the rest are a guidance counselor to custodians\nThrough administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman in the team this year there's a pollock watch them doing this\nLisa so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school I saw that ride a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drill\nOkay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks that fire during these drills so\nThe first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the sea so you have to put your finger on the sensor is like a fingerprint\nAnd it's a little tricky\n[noise] [noise]\n\nI'm following a guy named John he's a principal for grades six to twelve\nHe's running from his office starts by the cafeteria [noise] he's got a gun he's rambling ... bass he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds one\nOf these shootings another kid can kill not enough of this way [noise]\n\nElementary awareness in the elementary when [noise]\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and\nHigh school right so the principles running down the hallway and it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the school doesn't to lock down\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nGuy driving he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nAll right here we go we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing the response\nWasn't great that wasn't attorney ... first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors [noise]\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option too though\nI I talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right\nThing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own and\nSo I wanted to learn so I went out\nAnd which is different you know first time you should have gone that's pretty scary it was scary to me\n[noise] after that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd would exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around\nHow close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target you've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss\nBecause they're finding is\nThere's a possibility or somebody else getting her [noise]\nAnd I can't let that happen\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings back to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't have believed\nBut these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\nIn\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nLike the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting it looks a pass to dissipate the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nAt one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough activity at people who invented something that actually seems to work and help\nThe b._b._c. Chicago it's this American Life America glass [noise]\nFrom\n\nGlen ... will never be pretty sure that's trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school\nBefore the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning and the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think we could have been more prepared than you and your work day and I mean they knew what to do we knew what to do\nEven still even with that we still had\nPast there have been people that are going to return to their families\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi and went to a park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well they did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up\nShe's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive once she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying we know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures dishes what we do for ... for every period\nFor every ... black and this is what we do for two days two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class\nBecause they wanted to make sure that the kids [noise] knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and I'll silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nWill colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nWas it says her kids to the drill seriously on a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in their classroom doors of paper\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building flicking terrified\nYou know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's they they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nShe knew it was real [noise]\n\nThe kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building I'm really was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total body is in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people and\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was laughing there were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how much time you can choose to follow the protocol follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\nRight\nIn her classroom with about our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder\nYou kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from\nThe hallway [noise] the group is small enough to fitness applied cause that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet and it was hot and dark except didn't faces led by their cell phones Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she's an attack so I said says there is a shooter there was a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my my friend Ferris says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been graced by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nThank God and I didn't hear from her for a while in our went by\nHeard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um I had to have a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on\nW ... members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming so standing member visit Cape and islands dot org\nUm and and the police and then the police evidence that this is a police anyone in here and then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door they didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooters and I know they have their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were caught and so I just\nVery slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise]\nWas uh told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy hold her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yelled to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nThey see is the teacher who's our most Gray's she survived Scott Beagle and the room next to this day seized at the same thing Stacey did\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the store way\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting trails of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation someone that's hard to study and they both told me\nThat having a playbook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I moved out to a closet [noise]\nThey also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys and every\nHow to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive because of it what might have worked better\nCheryl Johnson research is what the effective in these drills a baby or university and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international\nHas its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like he'd bring over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much\nIt's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso code ran\nAll the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said no to this too\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes and all I if I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to go pay code red meat\nFad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the pool [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked ... [noise]\nBut the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting sometimes you stay in your room [noise] sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym [noise]\nAs a last resort if I basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise] I told her about actually curse how sheets the doorway grabbing of dozens of your students remember it was a break\nFrom her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling and kids\nThe problem with this and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gum and being in a different building yes one\nThat was part of the training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did those actually\nAll locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would have been way harder to pull the kids into her room from the hallway\nShut the on barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school squatting hide\nBut when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that lend\nA classroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how an investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nAnd the researchers who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids who don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nWhere I come down on this\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nAllowed her to know about barricade ing\nAnd I want to know about renting and fighting back\nI Want her to know that active shooters because the thing to reckon with [noise]\nI Want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school\nCharles point about don't say codes\nChance breeze taken nice do you really can nice deep breath\nBreeze with me [laughter]\n\nAfter a few minutes he's kind of breath enough to talk he tell Sandy he wants to shooting stops you want to take action somehow\nAnd then Chad suddenly switches gears and start filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know and do the viruses going on in this world goes away is not going to change that because the strip orange or drug stores are still able to get\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year to build those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and factories\nLike bump stocks a person can buy however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing\nPoor but it's impossible for grieving parents\nTo avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement a conspiracy theorist who believe that the U. S. government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are big he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Phillip says ran into him face to face and a gun control of that he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and other than I'm listening to him just going\nYou are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match was about to start until Sandy stepped in and broke it up I reached out to Joan through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNoticed truth or ... or ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting is can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave\nInterviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail so hoaxes or one of the things the Philips has learned parents about\nThey tell families to brace themselves\nOh mhm mhm [noise] Mm [noise]\nAfter watching money and Sandy in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started to find called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was screaming just\n[noise]\nArnold screaming in the background panic and he sent 'em there's been a shooting [laughter] like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nWas a coincidence just left a food court in a mall\nAnd open fire so my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK me so I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screamer so low it was so horrific and something I never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nWere twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asks if they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes because they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nThat when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt nervous\nUncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces and he said that's what we looked like five months ago\nThat looked like [noise] um\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been crying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's what I looked like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nWanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy sad that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw\nBut the ... there was also a strong an instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from [noise] well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents had lots of kids suddenly environmentally and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moment that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work\nBut then what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what they want you to get back to normal light moment brothers should face it you're not the same as you were should you know let me explain children you're right I'm not the same person I never will be they should as we're obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Phillip says in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nPeople who were closest to disappear which makes us informal support group even more crucial [noise]\nWithout support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting at Parkland on a kitten that store at\nAnd let them at their house there is something was Nick he was the cats in the Parkland swim team who's about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid who collected different flavors of\nOreos and waited for a Supreme drops that said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting Mitch an article about phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nicolas okay one person said they heard he'd\nBeen moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting another set of police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who mentioned that description but by that evening the door at still hadn't are directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in sync is Nick calling from somebody else's phone um media was telling you you have any comment can we have to find your son and as you say [noise]\nYeah and I'm at two o'clock in the morning they see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the years like strange from these rooms\nThan their names were called out even\nLittle hope that they're going to say like we we couldn't even find your son you know and that whole thought that he was somewhere else and I'm taking keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like Sam takes that long to our house\nAnd then they told us the news that he was gone it was shot than he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare second ...\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a could want it to look at his injuries Mitch did not\nHonest says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answer the phone said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again is Nicholas cage to swim or other swimmers perfect [noise] I think it's meant that there was nothing on his face or its head at like ... it was perfect", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This
