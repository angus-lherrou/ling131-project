[noise] but these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\nIn\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nLike the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings that looks at past to dissipate the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nAt one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to have people who invented something that actually seems to work and help the b._b._c.\nChicago this American Life America last [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n... will never be punished for this trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for a gunman there's an example whether that might be really helpful\nAnd that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in television interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think we could have been more prepared than any work day I mean they knew what to do we knew what to do\nEven still even with that we still had\nCats are the people that are going\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question when reproduces Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up\nShe's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive once she and the other teachers have been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the cage and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nFor every period ... this is what a code black it this is what we do it for two days two days we went over the procedures with the kids might have to do it with each and every class\nBecause they wanted to make sure that the kids\nKnew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that then you still stay wrapped in our silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy\nTheir on an alternating schedule [noise]\nWas it says her kids to the drill seriously on a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a tent\nThere to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors of paper\nSee like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building looking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's they they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots\nThat is not what the drill was\nShe knew it was real\n[noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building I'm really was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gun shot sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total body it's in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people and\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was and what happens there were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that I\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what she'd been taught you can choose to follow the protocol follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\nRight\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency\nFolder she kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway group a small enough to fitness applied cause that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet\nIt was hot and dark except students face as led by their cell phones Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she tax she's on the tax cuts that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Ferris says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn the hallway um we got really quiet um I had to have a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the cause it without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like it was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police adviser said this is the police anyone in here and then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time I set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door they didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the hands all and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooters and I know they have their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were caught\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise]\nWas uh told me that actually was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day about holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yelled to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nThey see the teacher who's our most grade she survived [noise] Scott Beagle and the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the store way\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation someone that's hard to study and they both told me that having a playbook\nFor what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my ...\n... [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive because of it what might have worked better\nCheryl Johnson research is what's effective in these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's\nTwo o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso code ran all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said notice to I'm a big advocate for not using codes at all I I\nIf I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to go a code red meat fad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there's a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet [noise] but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options [noise] any more ways responds was shooting sometimes you stay in your room [noise] sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym [noise]\nAs a last resort you fight basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise] I told her about actually curse how sheets the doorway grabbing of dozens of your students remember it was a break from her school's protocol\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually did the right thing pulling and kids the problem with\nThis and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gun me being in a different building yes\nHitting your door basically pushing lots of furniture out the answer classroom door [noise] but most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did just actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to ... the kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine four\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school sweating hide\nWhen I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about that one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nClassroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting hide because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nWhere I come down on this\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nAllowed her to know about Barack heating\nAnd I want her to know about running in fighting back\nI Want her to know that active shooters because it's a thing to recognize [noise]\nWant her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school\nShelves point about don't pay codes\nChance breeze taken nice the grass [laughter] he can nice deep breath\nBreathe with me [laughter]\n\nAfter a few minutes he's kind of breath enough to talk he tell Sandy he wants to shooting stops you want to take action somehow\nAnd then Chad suddenly switches gears and start selling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know before I was going on in this world goes away it's not going to change that because the strip or enjoy drug stores are still able to get\nPlan to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year to build those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a Second Amendment\nTax and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks a person can buy however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving\nParents to avoid the politics around guns there is a whole movement of conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are big he's now a defendant and several of the nation on news when the Phillip says ran into him face to face and a gun control a bad he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and then I'm listening to him just going you are so\nAbsolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy stepped in and broke it up I reached out to Joan through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists noticed truth\n... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting is can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave interviews and Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail so hope there's or one of the things the Philips has learned parents about\nThey tell families to brace themselves oh\nMhm mhm [noise] Mm [noise]\nAfter watching money and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started just to find called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was screaming just\n[noise]\nArnold screaming in the background panic and [noise] he sent 'em there's been a shooting [laughter] like what is he\nAnd at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left the food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I trashed\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was so horrific and took the no never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room fighting down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nOr twenty first graders insects educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted develops as\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy so they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes because they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they\nFelt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and\nI saw their faces and he said that's what we look like five months ago\nThat looked like [laughter] I'm\nThey're hanging on to each other ah they've been crying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy sad that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort out her parents when they were still so raw but the Philips has said there was also a strong an instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from\n[noise] well they were there they ran into parents and other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson\nBut many places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moment that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things\nEverything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on which they want you to get back to normal light moment brothers should they should do the same as you were should you know let me explain something you're right I'm not to shrink person on there will be they should as we're obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nPeople who were closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial [noise]\nBut that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting in Parkland Hanukkah and that store at I met them at\nTheir house there is something was neck he was the cats in the Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis unexplained scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops that said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting ... phone calls and tax all day\nFrom people who said they'd heard Nicolas okay one person\nSaid they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting another set of police officer was giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who mash next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in thinking that calling from somebody else's phone um media was telling you you have any comments can we have to find your son and as you say [noise]\nYeah and I'm at two o'clock and\nCar and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the years like strange from nature and\nThen their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like we we couldn't even find your son you know and that whole thought that she was somewhere else and I'm taking give them thinking maybe he walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house\nAnd then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare second nightmare\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a could wanted to look at his injuries Mitch did not\n... says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answered the phone and said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again is Nicholas ... swimmer this summer's perfect [noise] I think it's meant that there was nothing on his face or his head I like his state was perfect", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day":
