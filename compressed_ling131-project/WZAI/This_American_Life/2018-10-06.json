TV and you'd see is tortured face\nTo drag his decisions down to the wire over and over undecided and seem like a no when Kavanaugh was yes that was let's wait a week there's deflate committed the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill\nIs with them in the days before and after the cabinet of hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made his choices there's always the first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay\nIt's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator here and tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't as clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at sleek peering out from the elevator and just admit for an interview just leaks fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\n... dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat and now he was stuck\n\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination than English confronted by a mob of screaming protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and crumbled\n... was one of the two women in that confrontation that her play good morning good morning when the elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[laughter] [noise]\nOr ... and Maria Gallagher the other one that the elevator they always hedge how influential they were the last of others don't and I'm reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAnd on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days lots of people loved this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last\nWeek has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and this morning that they have any sort of your mind also we talked about it\nBut I Do think there was a\nIt was a saying she's not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that\nI've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them they're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories of sexual assault it's everywhere and it's a lot\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on the other side of the building he's in the middle of the story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with that they were ... euro shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake\nWhat do you think you can ... what do you have to pay something you said that went in right now and the survivors\nWhen you

to emotion [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like\nThis undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that and then we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there's likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this room today and go and just have a little humility on that front like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThan eight after the Ford Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night fleet stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assault he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said he found Ford credible and convincing became back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony Noone else could put him in the room that night\nHe found cabin are credible also and his anger wasn't is off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen them like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a vote 'em has been it's just\nIt's a debates with staff discussions\nLate last night too and\nIt was that was pretty raw you know [noise]\nNext morning of course\nHe's going to vote yes on the judge

[noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens Jeff as a conservative senator has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't know\nWho's thought the FBI report was a disgrace to basically didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not\nTell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as late voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am am presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied with the FBI before\nDo you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had

Court for years this him being questioned into ... back in twenty ten\nI stand here today just just a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through\nIt well I like\n[noise]\nYou know remember the\nSenate is\nA political body and\nThe frame or just knew that and it's really\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nI Do think ah\nIt has the obligation or\nTo recognize the necessity of\nPreserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd integrity of our court and\nDo what you should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nThe learning I\nThe judge should be broadly read\nUm\nI myself was of fascinated with political theory at you know if if you ask what makes a good judge you're going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about\nSo ... ... southern southern southern slanted a as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience getting high school students people ask them by the state but cases you'd always wanting to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a good talker and explained his job how it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us and um and discuss the case\nUh we begin with or group seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nLeast senior and if the case is the one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it and\nLet's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just reverse of our from it's a question that the rationale\nThe principle of the reasons that you get and let's say at five to four the\nFive and the majority don't have a lot of ... laps and high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of all\nWe realize one of us will have to write\nAn opinion that commands the allegiance\nOf the American people [noise] uh\nAn opinion that explains\nTeach the principles of war the principles of the constitution\nAnd when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case we draw down on that capital of trust we make a withdrawal on the trust in the public has been our institution and it is our job always to replenish\nA bite hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works\n\nOh\nOkay well my story I don't know it just tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it just kind of fun to hear how we talk about this\nI was meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama and I think it was a Saturday morning and for my schedule or there's are both it was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd one attorney raised his hand and said now you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs or how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and\nI Divide them up among the course of course I have to read them all and they're very difficult cases I Will take them home and read the breach the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have a separate playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre one opera cases sometimes to opera case [noise]\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the odd that they were to fly to roll their eyes but\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually pretentious or you know here's some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I lost the audience but I was safe because a attorney in the room raised his hand\nIs alive the rule like that when I write those briefs I said oh it is that either one six pack ...\n[noise]\nI said I think I remember your last one it was a three six factory\nThanks to the forum club for the Palm Beach is the recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up

difficult momentous decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them that whatever program today was about a judge at two is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us from the pod cast heavyweight\nIf you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan gold's dean and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with they want to make right with another person usually it's something I've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan but he's the kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny or the one that we have today is a more serious wind\nI sought incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince everyone to choose life imprisonment\nWhen in fact all I had to do was declines of death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fan could have cast so they would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty plus story would have gotten life in prison without parole [noise]\nThat would that would have been nice to know\nI could have changed\nAfter the article was\nI think spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness should forgiven may hands if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness it felt so weird like it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor than it didn't make sense why would Maryland and want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean well I I wasn't sure how to reply with something\nAs powerful as a a ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nAlready did begin reply but I didn't I didn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and the sort of you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] feel like I really read things [noise]\n\nA few months have just been received Maryland's email an execution date was that\nThe state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened Glen and you'd have to carry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically due to the cherry presents a statement which reads in part\nWe do not like Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds\nBased on this testimony with only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed when news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email\nBut he didn't it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nWe're not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my gun for not trying\nShame leads to a nurse or\nAs even the most casual reader of the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain a nerd until it has acted upon by an external forces in other words it takes a little nudge\nAnd who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write in Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would read and I hope I'm not being too forward\nI ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger about a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes\nI have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply\nShe also forward to her original emailed to span the once you send two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about when I read it\nI'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Maryland Thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son or tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark\nI understand that fan consumed by guilt would read so much into so little but would I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place [laughter]\n... it's a joke I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get ... some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK Marilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us to meet in the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering a food that she can stop refusing you want to have the coffee or tea know\nMaryland is Tom Allen stately with smiling eyes she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black\nShe sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of what her life was like before the trial\nI was always slice of the party I mean I was a joke sure I'll make sure you have melons because she's going to keep the policy going [noise] I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people who you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you ...\nGet up she'll go do it so since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person everyday she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and wearing endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though\nIs that the people who remain the people closest to her you know look upon her son\nShe says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and under the ... and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member were out is the cause of all of this and that was a very hard for them it's like they wanted everything to be okay but that much how and I love him and I'm not gonna ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him men working with her son's lawyers to change your sentence to life in prison\nPaul's appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became extremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it costs me my job\nAfter losing her job Maryland then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son so it's\nKind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over\nSo that's a hard thing\nI'm\nIn I'm\nTen years after the trial and everyone or friends or family has moved on\nTo win Maryland reds fans article she signed him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay the Senate's the death penalty I thought\nThought I had literally died it didn't even register because I'm just like what just happened what have they done\nYou know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read okay what are they thinking what are they doing\n'em I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he is and I want people to know you know everybody's they assume that if you involved in a heinous crime that the true a monster but he wasn't a monster [noise]\nYou know she is going to come up\nAbout an hour and a half when the front desk that I think that probably\nAn ... fan event as the ... and spin yeah yes fan\n[laughter] I Hope I get there before we get to [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice arts fans span this at the door\n[noise] time that I've done and it's very nice lady and things and yeah I'm here now have you\nBack then there was no okay\nI get a lot of trouble then lingers in the door the hotel room\nAnd a half feet over there um\nHe's the spectacle neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears his throat um [noise] a little nervous [noise] and so\nThere was the last time Maryland in fan and been in the same room was ten years ago at the trial\nMaryland was seated behind the bar fence and the jury box but today he sits down in the empty armchair beside or you can't quite bring himself to look at her as he tells Maryland what it was like to receive or email you gaze is down in his lap\n[noise] it was very surprising and um [noise] I read and re read it and I even began\nTo her letters or never went anywhere I Want to say what did you say about that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American
