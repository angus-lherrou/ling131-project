R. and B. C. A. H. D. one Woods Hole Martha's Vineyard\nBut he won't play one to be in a ... point three WBAI Bruce turned W GBH each tree and point seven Boston you can stream is on line at Cape and islands\nData to Lebanon Iraq it just school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half\nBefore school started after a bunch of training they're running their first drill in the school building with their guns French and the boxes\n\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district Merle Ohio that let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air the people on this team only two teachers solitude for the rest are a guidance counselor to custodians\nThe three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team vicious pollock watch them doing this\nLisa so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small face that have been installed in locations of at the school [noise] I saw the ride a bike trails\nAnd then all of them the goal was to render their safe get the guys out of the safe and then get to where the shooter is\nAnd they time each drill\nOkay we're going to play to the decision to warn listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nThat fire during Israel's [noise] so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the sea so you have to put your finger on the sensor is something\nAnd it's a little tricky\n[noise] [noise]\nThere's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the shoe [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's a principal for grade six to twelve [noise]\nHe's running from his office starts by the cafeteria [noise] he's got a gun Israel bullet proof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds one\nOf these shootings another to kill not enough of this way [noise]\n\nElementary awareness in the elementary when [noise]\n\nFeel elementary winning the building also has middle school and high school right\nSo the principles running down the hallway and it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the school doesn't to lock down\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nMan driving he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n\nAll right here we go we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise]\nSo that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing the response\nWas the turning the very first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors [noise]\nWe says so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to though\nI I talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even though he doesn't think it's something that's right for every school he says he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one\nAnd the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force mhm so if a shooter gotten that do things they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right\nThing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own and\nAnd so I wanted to learn [noise]\nSo I went out and start learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary scary to me [noise]\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd would exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around\nHow close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target you've got to shoot that target Cindy can mess [noise]\nI Can't miss because if I miss\nThere's a possibility if somebody else getting hurt\nAnd I can't let that happen\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nUs doing it in my school\nOf course he might have to she wanted us to [noise] and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise] I I wouldn't have believed\nBut these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\nIn\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nLike the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it looks a pass to dissipate the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nAt one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful\nW ... members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nMhm mhm mhm\nOh\nA gun readings you'll never be pretty school just trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for a gunman there's an example out there that might be really helpful\nAnd that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained their students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think they could have been more prepared than any work day and I mean they knew what to do we knew what to do it\nEven still even with that we\nHad to have the people that are going to return to their family\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive once she and the other teachers have been trained they ran their students are all the new drills\nThose school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWant you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you're the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the cage and goes through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ... for every ... every day says what occurred black and this is what we do for\nTwo days two days we went over the procedures with the kids might have to do with each and every class because\nKnew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy\nTheir on an alternating schedule\nMelissa says her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors with paper\nIndoors to face the freshman building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshmen building flicking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that\nAnd it's there they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nShe knew it was real [noise]\n\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um and I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThere are following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshot sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people and\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was laughing there were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that\nActually wasn't the only teach her to stand in the doorway and said how with what she'd been time you can choose to follow the protocol follow your and then for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [noise]\nOoh\nIn her classroom lifted that are attendant sheet out of her emergency\nFolder and she kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from\nA different class she pulled in from the hallway the group is small enough to fitness apply apply that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot and dark except students face as led by their cell phone Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she ... she's an attack so\nThere's a shooter and my floor um and so my ... my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been grazed by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from\nHer for a while in our went by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the cause it without having the light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers said this is a police anyone in here and then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police if anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time I set it on like afterward I should do am I supposed to open the door they didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooters and I know they have their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle pushed it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise]\nWas uh told me that actually was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day about holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with ... you know the shooter and and yelled to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nThey see the teacher who's our most grades she survived [noise] Scott Beagle and the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the store way\nVery little evidence about whether school shooting drills\nThe data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a\nPlaybook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I Move us all to a closet\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has their lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what's effective in these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much\nIt's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso ... all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said notice to\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes at all I I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go a code red meat fad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet [noise] but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting sometimes you stay in your room [noise] sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more access like a cafeteria gym [noise]\nAs a last resort you fight basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise] I told her about actually occurs how sheets the doorway grabbing I've dozens of your students remember it was a break from her school's protocol\nThe thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing\nPulling in kids the problem with that\nAnd unless you're there you don't know [noise] you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gun me being in a different building yes one thing that was part of their training at Douglas was barricaded on your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door\nBut most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would have been way harder to tell the kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would have made it in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school squatting hide\nBut when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nClassroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting hot because they practiced it\nAnd how it investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nWhere I come down on us\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nAllowed her to know about barricade ing\nAnd I want her to know about renting and fighting back\nI Want her to know that active shooters because the thing to reckon with [noise]\nI Want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school\nCharles point about dumped the codes\nChance brief taken nice the press he can nice the rats [laughter]\nBreathe with me [laughter]\n\nAfter a few minutes he's caught his breath enough to talk he tell Sandy he wants to shooting stops you want to take action somehow\nAnd then Chad's suddenly switches gears in starts filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nNo anti viruses going on them\nThat is not going to change that because the strip or yours drug stores are still able to do and now\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turns Twenty one later this year to build says are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories\nLike bump stocks person could buy however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach\nTheir primary goal is to support but it's impossible for\nGrieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists who believe that the U. S. government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are big he's now a defendant in several destination lawsuits when the Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control and then he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he seen your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and on it and I'm listening to him just going\nYou are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match was about to start until Sandy stepped in broken up I reached out to Jones through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNotice truth ers are hopes are troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave interviews and Aurora he got death threats and had to get\nThe FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail so hopefully or one of the things the Philips is born parents about they tell families to brace themselves\nOh Mm Mm [noise] Mm [noise]\nAfter watching money in any in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse's prime called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone\n[noise] [noise] screaming just\n[noise]\nArnold screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting site what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left the food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was so horrific and something I never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room fighting down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night\nAnother Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nOr twenty first graders insects educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted develops as\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy so they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes because they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown than he says they felt nervous uncomfortable\nMaybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband when we walked in the room and I saw their faces and he said that's what we look like five months ago\nThat looked like [laughter] I'm\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been crying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's what I looked like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nWanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality\nProbably too soon for them to be out there trying to confront other parents when they were still so raw but the Philips has said there was also a strong an instant sense of kinship\nThat they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents had lots of kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moment that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy has set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids voted to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on which they want you to get back to normal light loan brothers should they should dream of shame as you were should you know let me explain children you're right I'm not to shrink person on there will be they should as we're obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nPeople you were closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial [noise]\nWhat's that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that\nSandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting in Parkland Hanukkah in that store at\nAnd let them at their house there is something was neck he was the cats in the Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid who collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops and it said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends\nThey talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together\nThe day of the shooting ... phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nicolas okay one person said they've heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting another set of police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who match next description [noise] but by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement\nRoom with other parents and waited every time the phone rings you jumped and think his name calling from somebody else's phone um media was calling you do you have any comments can we help you find your son as just like [noise]\nYeah and I'm at two o'clock in the morning they see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the airstrikes claims from these rooms\nThen their name for a call now\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like we we couldn't even find your son you know and I hope that she was somewhere else\nAnd I'm taking keep I'm thinking maybe he walked home and and then you do the math in your head like some take that long to our house and then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare second nightmare\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a could wanted to look at his injuries Mitch did not\nHonest says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answer the phone and said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "13"}
