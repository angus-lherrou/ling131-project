know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl with them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean\nIt was like maybe the maybe keeping a diary where one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe\nOther people in another kind of situation need to actually\nMake up a little fantasy yeah I think um\nI didn't have much anxious about being the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great [noise] um\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience of a million people was was getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions\nWon't affect millions of people like how is that enough motivation you know\nJust to have your petty little craft and your petty little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nYou know it just seemed pathetic [noise]\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for

remarkably like story from this American Life\nNot for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio but this week's show however we had her put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIndustry that an incident that happened to her back when

going to\nA lot about it um [noise] it actually good for me thinking along [laughter]\nScott talked about the idea one night in the dining hall\nThe next day on the way to class\nHe saw signs all over
