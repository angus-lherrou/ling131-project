N. A. on the ticket\nThan you more points three ... a ivory staring and W. GBH H. T. three nine prints and Boston on line and keep an island ... moon in\n\nMy mind the news was boring ... politics is boring that happen right\nWing ... that you were there I was there that happened in our lives\nI miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it\nI don't know about you but me I spent a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling\nPeople to discuss it and I know this is just\nDaily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years where red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions\nTo me this one feels the worst I think because the original hearing itself a doctor for it and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so\nEmotionally wrong that even watching it was emotional it was upsetting\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us off for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief Republican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nBut even in moments like this one there are people who haven't picked aside\nAnd incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I have to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them today and I shall we have somebody in that situation in\nAct Arizona Senator Jeff flake and the second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding on a man's life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise] but those people having to make these huge\nTall [noise] WB the Chicago this American Life America stay with us [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nJudge to Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nTo drag his decisions down to the wire over and over used undecided than seem like a known Kevin up there was a yes it was let's wait a week is if we can be the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA British is do we change has been a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months that he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill is with them in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about in the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator near and tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator he just stood me up for an interview just late fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past\nA bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat\nKnow\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he will be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination that English confined by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake crumbled\nArchie and I was one of the two women in that confrontation play good morning good morning when that elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n\n... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential\nReading things like the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history an online\nSite support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days [noise] lots of people love this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last\nWeek has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see here so I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff leaks mind is not true first of all I saw him she just had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and maybe this morning that they have any blow your mind\nAlso we talked about it wasn't it was a\nIt was the thing is not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that\nI've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them they're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere and it's a lot just the day before\nLincoln I'd gotten an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham [noise] women jumped on the elevator with that they were being a hero to a shirt and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake easily\nWhat are you know when you think you can't replace what do you have to say something you can say that went in right now in the survivor glad we're having this or\nIt affects you and people like\nBenefits of each of\nThe ... making fun of himself talked about this for like lots of men his age doesn't connect you well to emotion [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both\nVery rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nAnd they would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just isn't sure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's all we've got a I Would just urge colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this room today and uh and just have a little humility on that front so\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happened at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happened here\nThe night after the Ford Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talk to lawyers going over what was said he found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony Noone else could put him in the room that night\nHe found cabin are credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a boat um has been is just\nTo add debates staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that was pretty raw [laughter] you know [noise]\nUh next morning of course we finally released a statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the head and you've got to come back to\nFor some sort of innocence\nYou go to the elevator get yelled at on TV and to the committee meeting you know that part\nMeanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and he gets the news that freaks yes he chokes up reportedly says\n... you know look Jeff and I both went to the same place had read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens Jeff as a conservative senator has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't know\nWho's thought the FBI report was a disgrace to basically they didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is\nThe voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence she told me over and over he was satisfied that the FBI was what\nDo you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with the ... you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nAddress I asked people [laughter] that stuff I a template except for only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is No Child to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family ever\n\nVery chase ... program which turned out it is a recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years and being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today justice a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through\nAll that well I like\n[noise]\nYou know remember the Senate\nIs a political body and\nThe frame or just knew that and it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nI Do think ah\nIt has the obligation or\nTo recognize the necessity of\nPreserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd integrity of our court\n[laughter]\nYou should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nThe learning I think\nThe judge should be broadly read\nUm I my self was of fascination\nWhat makes a good judge you're going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful\nAbout [noise]\nSome southern southern southern southern slanted a as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience of putting high school students people asking stupid cases you'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a big talker and he explained his job how it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us and um and discuss the case uh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nLeast senior and if the case is one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four case and it's not just reverse refer him it's a question that the rationale\nThe principle of the\nReasons that you give and let's say it's five to four the\nFive and the majority don't have a lot of back slaps on high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment\nOf all as\nWe realized one of us will have to write an opinion that commands the allegiance\nOf the American people are\nAn opinion that explains the teach the principles of law or the principles of the constitution of the controls a result\nAnd when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case uh we draw down on that capital of trust we make a withdrawal and the trust that in the public has it in our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish\nA bite hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nStory I don't know it just tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talks about this\nI was meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama and I think it was a Saturday morning and for my schedule or there's are both it was at nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney raises Hannah said now you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs ah how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the course of course I have to read them all\nAnd if they're very difficult cases I Will take them home and read the breach the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have opera playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that are one application sometimes to opera case [noise]\nWell the minute I Know that that I I kinda knew I lost the odd that they were to flight to roll their eyes but\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually pretentious thirty I hear some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I lost the audience but I was safe because a attorney in the room raised his hand\nIs all I have a rule like that when I write those breeze I said oh it is that either one sixth ... sixth\nBack [noise]\nI

program today was about a judge at two is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us in the pod cast heavyweight if you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan Gold steam and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with they want to make right with another person usually it's something I've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan is the kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny or the one that we have today is a more\nI sought incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince everyone to choose life imprisonment when in fact\nAll I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote vote fan could have cast so they would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole [noise]\nThat would that would have been nice to know\nI could have changed\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend\nNever expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness should reopen me if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness it felt so weird like it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor spend it didn't make sense why
