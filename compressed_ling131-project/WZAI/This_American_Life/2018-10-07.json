G. three eighty nine\nPoint seven Boston on line at Cape and islands dot org\n\nRemember in the news was boring politics is boring that happened right\nI'm not imagining that you're there I was there that happened in our lives\nI miss it\nI didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it\nI don't know about you but me it's been a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same about income to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me this one feels the worst [noise] I think because the original hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so\nEmotionally wrong that even watching it was a motion was upsetting\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief\nRepublican disbelief or the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nBut even in moments like this one\nAn incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide to have to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them\nToday and I shall we have somebody in that situation and our first act Arizona Senator Jeff flake second we leave Washington behind we have somebody who's\nLiterally deciding on a man's life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nThose those people having to make these huge decision they are not comfortable with all [noise] WB the Chicago just American Life America stay with us [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] judge\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you see is tortured face\nDrag his decisions down to the wire over and over used undecided than seem like a no when Kavanaugh was yes that was let's wait a week is if we can be the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA British is do we choose to spend a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill\nJews were them in the days before and after the cabinet a hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made his choices there's always the first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story\nOf Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator here and tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator he just stood me up for an interview [noise] just like these can be a little deceiving she looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\n... dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the vote\nKnow\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nWhat they said in that elevator door appears to have\nAnd their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he will be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination that English confounded by a mob of screaming protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and crumbled\n... was one of the two women in that confrontation play good morning good morning when that elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days lots of people love this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of\nThese last week has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see here so I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff leaks in mind is not true first of all I saw him she just had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and maybe this morning that they have any blow your mind\nAlso we talked about it wasn't the ... and there was a\nIt was the thing is not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that\nI've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them they're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories of sexual assault it's everywhere and it's a lot\nJust a de before fleeing I gotten an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham [noise] women jumped on the elevator with that they were being a hero treasure and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out do you believe women Senator Flake you believe in\nWhat do you live in one way and therefore we when we were you thinking what do you have to say something you can save it went in right now and the survivors\nDoes it affect you and people like that [noise]\nThe week making fun of himself talked about\nEach she doesn't connect to well to emotion [laughter] and he walked into the hearing\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh I'm\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going to a deal like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke in the hearing you sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this room today\nAnd uh and just have a little humility on that front ...\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThe night after the for Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do some close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing became back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a boat um has been is just\nTo have debates staff discussions late last night too and ah [noise]\nIt was that was pretty rough [laughter] you know [noise]\nUh next morning of course like finally releases the statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the head and you've got to come back to\nFor some sort of innocence\nAnd to the committee meeting new that part\nMeanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and and he gets the news that freaks yes he chokes up reportedly since ...\nLooked Jeff and I both went to the same place and read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship we are we are viewing this through a different lens a Jeff as a conservative senator has always\nI have not and I don't know\nWho's thought the FBI report was a disgrace basically didn't follow up on any leads you said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or a criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate or\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over\nHe was satisfied with the FBI before do you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nAre people that stuff or or the ... party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no file to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family ever\n\nVery chase is one of the producers of a program which turned out it is a recording that we found that Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years and being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today just is a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through\nIt well I like\n\nYou know remember the Senate is\nA political party and\nThe frame or just knew that and it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nI Do think ah\nIt has the obligation\nHe's the necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd the integrity of our court and\nDo\nWhat you should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nThe learning I\nThe judge should be broadly read um I myself was of fascinated with political theory you\nKnow if if you ask what makes a good judge you're going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful\nAbout [noise]\n... ... ... southern southern southern Senate or as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience getting high school students people asked embed escape it cases they'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a good talker and explained his job how it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us and uh and discuss the case uh we begin with or seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nLeast senior and if the case is one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just reverse of our from it's a question that the rationale\nThe principle of the reasons that you get and let's say five to four\nThe five and the majority don't have a lot of back slaps on high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment\nOf all as\nWe realize one of us will have to write\nAn opinion that commands the allegiance\nOf the American people are\nAn opinion that explains\nThe teach the principles of war the principles of the constitution or that that controls will result\nWhen we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case we draw down on a capital of trust we make a withdrawal\nWhen you contribute to WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support double UCI at Cape and islands data work you're into the principal's neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nRight\nOkay one more story I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talks about this\nI was meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning and for my schedule or there's are both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorneys raised his hands that now you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs or how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the course of course I have to read them all\nAnd or if they're very difficult cases I Will take them home and read the breach the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have opera playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that are one opera cases sometimes to opera case [noise]\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the ... and they were to flight to roll their eyes\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually pretentious thirty out here some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I lost the audience but I was safe because a attorney in the room raised his hand\nIs all I have a rule like that when I write those briefs I said oh yeah that I have a one sixth ... sixth back\n[noise]\nI said I think I remember your last one was a three six pack\nTo reform club the Palm Beach is recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up the total and complete amateur has

today's program the unhappy to siders stories of people who are saddled with difficult momentous decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them that one of our program today was about a judge at two is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes stretching the pod cast heavyweight if you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan Gold steam\nAnd the premise of the show is that each episode people come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with it wouldn't make right with another person usually it's something they'd been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan please the kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny or the one that we have today is at my serious one\nI sought incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince everyone to choose life imprisonment when in fact\nAll I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fan could have cast so they would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty plus story would have gotten life in prison without parole [noise]\nThat would that would have been nice to know\nI could have changed\nAfter the article was published something else happened I think spend never expected or want it\nStories mother Marilyn got in touch ...\nWell filled with sentiments of forgiveness shooting forgiven may hands if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and knowing knowing that there's that forgiveness that felt so weird like it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland and want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that\nAnd like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean well I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nI did begin reply but I didn't I didn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and that sort of you know there's so much pain in there and [noise]\nFeel like I really read things uh [noise]\nA few months have just been received Maryland's email an execution date with that the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen\nBut then something unexpected happened Glenn injured at the cherry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judith cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not like\nPaul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son\nThey are innocent of his deeds based on this testimony with only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed when news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email\nBut he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nI'm not trying\nShame leads to a nurse and it's even the most casual reader of the fundamental physics will tell you\nAnd an object will remain a nerd until that has acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write in Maryland a letter\nI Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would read and I hope I'm not being too forward\nI ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of ... Berger about a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Maryland writes I have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply\nShows a forward to her original email to span the once you send two years ago when he can't stop thinking about when I read it\nExpecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness\nNever even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Maryland Thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son or tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark\nI understand that fed consumed by guilt would read so much into so little but what I don't understand is why Marilyn sent in the mail in the first place\nDidn't represent a joke I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get ... some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK\nMarilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us to meet in the hotel suite downtown where I can stop offering the food that she can stop refusing\nYou want to have a coffee or tea know\nMaryland is Tom Allen stately with smiling eyes she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black she sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always slice of the party I mean I was a jokester\nI'll make sure you have melons because she's going to keep the policy going I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people who you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSince the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person every day she's\nAnd wearing endlessly about safety in prison for friends has fallen away the things that's hardest though is that the people who remain the people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and under the ... and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member were out is the cause of all of this and that was a very hurtful it's like they wanted everything to be okay but that's my child and I love him and I'm not gonna ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him men working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nPiles appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality jobs she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became extremely hard for me to concentrate at work and\nI felt like it cost me my job\nAfter losing her job Maryland then lost her how she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over\nSo that's a hard thing\nI'm\nI'm [noise] I'm\nTen years after the trial and every one of her friends or family have all moved on to win Maryland reds fans article she signed him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay defendants the death penalty I thought I had that I\nThought I had literally die at it didn't even register because I'm just like what just happened what have they done\nYou know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read okay what are they thinking what are they doing\n'em I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he is and I want people to know you know everybody has their own that if you involved in a heinous crime like that the true a monster but he wants a monster [noise]\nYou know because she is in Maryland and I had been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk for\nProbably\n... then they sit in\nYes fan [laughter]\nI Hope I get there before we get to [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice arts fans spanned is at the door\n[noise] and then I'm Jonathan it's very nice of you and thanks yeah I'm here now how do you\nThat then yeah okay\nI get a lot of trouble then lingers in the door the hotel room and a half feet over there uh he's the spectacle neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears his throat um [noise] a little nervous [noise] so [noise]\nThere there were the last time Maryland in fan and been in the same room was ten years ago at the trial\nMaryland was seated behind the bar fans sat in the jury box but today he sits down in the empty armchair beside or you can't quite bring himself to look at her as he tells Marilyn what it was like to receive or email you gaze is down in his lap\n[noise] it was very surprising and um [noise] a rather than I re read it and I even began so her\nLetters or never went anywhere I ...
