working class voters especially men that the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually lose his big when the president is under fifty percent\nDemocrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably and midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young people\nOh All right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks Mara thank you\nFor all the focus on how the Democratic party shifting to the left nationally\nIf Democrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district is deep red and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat McAdams\nOr in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year of deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump how do you view the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise] you know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends\nBut he's a lot more measured and cautious about it the most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations I Will work with the Trump\nGood for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I want to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district the\nVotes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress that I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two term congresswoman who got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican\nLove is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly why I'm working with I build\n... relationship on both sides of the aisle love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nIs also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slur to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact the only one in this delegation\nThat stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nAnd it's something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I tried to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a boat from McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact macadam says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence and Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first or the solutions comes first as Democrats lost a lot\nIn casualties were moderates like McAdams but many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey're calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderates shifts party dynamics especially if they're the ones responsible for

what what are they based their calculations the theory on\nThat's right so it has to do with looking very very carefully at the light curve of the parent star\nAnd the reason that we even know that there is a planet there is by looking at the the light curve and how it didn't want the planet passes in front of the star\nAnd what they've seen in this case are anomalies in that ... that can only

Sears demise or near demise with glee because if series is still doing business in in their facility they're happy to take the space back\nThese are malls with four five six acres in some cases that are fully talented and there were only a limitation is available parking\nSo they're losing one anchor store but they've got others American what would they do it to share space well\nThey're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their experiential opportunity in the form of headed food offerings things of that sort okay and then there are B and C moles and these

the anchors store was typically a department store in the department stores genre is for the most part on its way out but now several things have happened first of all the apparel an accessory trends have declined uh customers are spending an enormous amount of disposable income on tech\nAnd on experiential opportunities rather than on amassing wardrobe sort of a close\nAnd the whole idea that an

by twenty sixteen he was about to cut the ribbon at the current hotel he bragged about it on the campaign trail series in Fairfield, Connecticut\nVery very complex for luxury hotels good old boy a lot

local food reports up now with ... and this week just learned more about how the new farm bill could impact local growers in consumers to changes to snap that's the acronym for\nThe Supplemental Nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps\nRoughly every five years the house and the Senate work together to pass a new farm bill the most recent farm bill expired on September thirtieth by Congress still hasn't negotiated a new version\nFrenzy Randolph of the trail farmers' market and the nonprofit sustainable Kate says which bill pass it could have big implications for Cape Cod consumers and farmers\nThat's because about Seventy five cents of every dollar in the farm bill goes to nutrition programs like food stamps or snap\nFeeding people is that the heart of the farm bill and so on snap is an enormous part of the farm bill and there are some big differences between the house and the Senate right now and what is going to be happening going for\nThe big difference between the house and Senate versions of the bell has to do with an employment requirement in the house version in order to get snapped you'd actually have to have a job or being an employment training program here's fancy Randolph again\nA one in eleven households currently now receiving benefits would lose eligibility if the house version went through so on the Cape that could be almost a thousand people because of the ... because of the work requirement and there's also a requirement that if you were ever incarcerated you would not be eligible for snap\nSnap or what used to be called food stamps has been part of the farm bill since the late night\nYou was to use government money to buy big agricultural surpluses like wheat or corn and distribute them to a hungry public more recently though some lawmakers have work to connect the dots between feeding communities improving health outcomes and providing economic stimulus for local farmers\nSo I'm really it was Gus Schumacher who was former am dark commissioner Massachusetts department of agricultural resources and then went on to be Clinton's under secretary of agriculture\nWho really kind of came up with this concept of 'em and nutrition incentive\nAnd I think it was called bonus bucks in Boston and what he decided that he could do is to enable people of low income through a snap card to arrive at a farmer's market and to receive some sort of bonus 'em to incentivize them to use their snap benefits with farmers\nMarkets you get an extra ten dollars in free tokens if you spend ten dollars and it's not money that doesn't just benefit small farmers\nIt also makes healthy fruits and vegetables more affordable the Orleans farmers' market started accepting snap benefits and participating in the nutrition incentives back in two thousand ten grand on our show who runs the market says they started off with only a few snap recipients\nSo we had maybe ten or Fifteen customers who participated in that and now I don't even know I think it's a hundred and fifty people months you know I mean it's a lot of people that we go through the Orleans farmers' market in the summertime that do that\nNor Joe and Randolph started the sustainable Cape farmers' market coalition in two thousand fourteen the idea was to help other farmers markets on the Cape and islands figure out how to start accepting snap and other nutrition incentives it's not rocket science but it's tedious and it's a lot easier with a template\nThe exact number of individuals receiving snap on the Cape and islands varies year to year and season to season but over the past decade in ... county the number has ranged from twelve thousand to twenty thousand\nThe economic stimulus for farmers markets on the Cape has been huge in two thousand Seventeen snap and other nutrition incentive for just over twenty six thousand dollars into the pockets of local growers and that's up six hundred and forty three percent in just two years here's fancy Randolph again\nIf we could move the legislation so that the snap benefits were encouraging fruit and vegetable consumption and encouraging that consumption through force\nOnly be helping people on food stamps and helping local farmers we could help her long term health and help our economy so it's really a package deal that's beyond a win win\nSometimes it feels impossible to create change\nBut it's inspiring to reflect on what these two women have managed to do with snap and farmer's markets in only a few years passed farm bills have made it a priority to expand access to farmers' markets for snap recipients whether the next bill continues this trend or moves in a different direction remains to be seen\nFor another UCA eyes local food report I'm off that hey\nWe've got
