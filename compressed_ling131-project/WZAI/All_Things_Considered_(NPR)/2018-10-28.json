I\nGet it on the road\nAnd I heard you ran into an aunt who was visiting with her knees and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat's right I I talked to Lisa flasher Jackson enter nice Eli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of ...\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmother is no longer with us but I mean I I spent a lot of time in the Senate guys this is where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified\nAnd I hope that we could make some some changes it's not just an attack on the Jewish people but as a tack on\nOn everybody in a community and markets are strong and we're going to make it through\nAnd I said she was with her knees to sixteen alley they both like you know just as many generations with his family have ties that his neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials well\nA tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and give support to the families that were\n... so what do they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime\nWell I just heard so much sadness so much shock as you always hear in these situations and and we study the aunt she mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for\nSort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun laws\nI think it's not about me definitely need to have gone lives but we definitely don't need to have you know security guards on at our schools at our temples that our churches\nPush and have to I mean some are we supposed to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers ought to this but where we go to pray it's not even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here right now\nWill fare you've also been getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much\nYeah thanks taxing and ... other Pittsburgh faith communities took time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life synagogue\nThe ...

A. in Pittsburgh\nAnd not far from here thousands are gathering to remember the eleventh people who were shot to death at a local synagogue the Jewish community center is leading the community gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall and open Pennsylvania faith leaders and politicians from ... from threw out Pennsylvania and beyond have gathered in a packed\nAuditorium NPR's Quil Lawrence is outside of the community service now and he's been talking to members of the Pittsburgh community all day Quinn welcome thank you so much for talking to us\nThank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this event\nYeah there's a beautiful hall and saw the auditorium and in the backdrop is Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers ...\nSome time in squirrel held a neighborhood with this attack occurred what was the mood there\n[noise] yeah I mean people were out in scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going to Sunday services and you can see the diversity of the communities notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the six president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC here's what you said\nI came today that\nWaiting patient and now that day I think I'm going to let them read the articles and these articles that I Want to sit and talk of the class and just give them a space [noise] have process\nThe Holocaust and weak\nAnd people were saying that you know in a little town like this you never think can happen but in today's America they realize it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to that point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was affected how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I ran into Dan Franco he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school at the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal here's what he said\n[noise] and they were really specials with men who are known for many years whenever I go to a tree of life for for ... for a wedding or\nSome kind of case to them are always\nIn the sanctuary\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an object of hate speech in this country\n... and now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying this next\nI felt like people run the sorrow this sort of cycle of sorrow and then pride in the solidarity of the community showing and then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle\nAnd massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents but the community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they say they talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country\n... and I wanted to be active that is NPR's Quil Lawrence called thank you thank you\nAnd as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this that are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children and how to talk to them about tragedies like this\nNPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in Studio ... thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand you're actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's\nMinds and fortunately I've covered several of these now and my career as a journalist and you know anytime there isn't a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible for kids not to hear about it right on the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified that\nThough you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue you also with other places tell us about that\nActually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great one actually and\nUh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want to place for families to to go and feel safe and comfortable they say and today was a pretty normal busy day at the museum and and uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too\nI met a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nJust that you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think it's happening\nShe says she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages four and six we're from Canada\nIt was very new to us and living here for the last year more regularly\nAcross the room at least the Hoffman was also ensure what to tell her two kids ages six and three about what they're seeing in the news\nIt's hard to [noise]\nI put it into a contract where they understand\nThat we haven't really talked about it yeah I have\nHoffman grew up in the Pittsburgh area and was back here to visit family and like so many here she has ties to\nFriends had by environment says that tree of life I hadn't\nAttendance Sunday school because my\nOh it's just really [noise] um\nPricing upsetting you know
