F. Y. I. and Kaiser Health news\nThe deadly limousine crash in New York that killed twenty people last weekend is raising questions about safety regulations little makers do not have to prove that their vehicles meet the same safety standards as other cars on the road and they never have NPR's Camila Domonoske reports\nAny ordinary passenger cars sold in the U.S has to meet federal safety requirements small buses have different safety rules here's where the limousine loophole comes in if you take a car and modify it stretching it out to fit as many people as a bus you don't have to prove it meets either set of standards\nLimousines are treated almost uniquely when we think about motor vehicles\nJason levine is the executive director of the center for auto safety\nStandards because they're neither Carson or buses\nRegular started to Jim in between the two of them have come up with nothing\nLimos are regulated by a patchwork of state and local rules for instance a law just came into effect in California it requires additional rear exits on stretch limousines a few years ago a bride and four of her friends died when they were trapped in the back of a limo that caught on fire\nThe local limo industry fought hard against the bill crews and find has the c._e._o. of dread unlocks a limo company in Southern California he says the cost of the new law was difficult for operators especially those using older Lincoln town cars stretches\nThe ritual of these modified when the uh the exits and be anywhere from a few thousand dollars up to ten twelve thousand dollars by them out from from from the value of some of those Lindsey\nButtons on day also says he personally would support more safety regulation\nThere should be nationwide shrimp proper regulations that make sure that these vehicles are up to be in these two certain wanting\nSome stretch when those are safer than others he says companies can do pull tests were a powerful machine ... seats to see if they budge\nIf you get something before the impact in the fee for it knocked off when we installed a certain place underneath the vehicle and on the interior of the vehicle\nBut not every company does those tests there are other risks safety experts say limos often lack side impact reinforcement and they don't always have to have enough seatbelts for every passenger you can look for a safe or a limo and find tastes as\nSome of the public not care about safety ... they seem to care about the price\nRosemary Shanahan is the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says the owners shouldn't be on customers to figure out if a limo is safe\nI think it's this really grossly unfair people course they always care about safety I think most people assume that if they're in the business that the minimum requirements that they have to be\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push toward regulating limos safety and twenty Fifteen there was a deadly limo crash on Long Island afterward Senator Chuck Schumer of New York issued a call for a federal agency to investigate such crashes the agency came up with recommendations but the national limousine association says it\nLevine of the center for auto safety says federal standards would be ideal for the sake of consistency\nBut if we're gonna continue to see a lack of a movement out of D.C having states lead the way I wouldn't be terrible\nInvestigators are still working out exactly what happened in New York last weekend when the two thousand one Ford stretch limousine crashed\nAnd killed twenty people but they already know that limo had failed inspection and the driver wasn't properly licensed Camilla dominant ski NPR News [noise]\n\n\nThis is NPR News\nI'm Elly Burleigh this week in

hundred thirty one points which is a three percent declined to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John Hi also [laughter] so what parts of the market ...\nWell a tech was particularly hit hard it's been the foundation of a this market but uh\nAnd um [noise] uh the the fall virtually wiped out all of these talk gains since mid summer but the tech sector has been the hardest hit and ... and as I said just one of the foundations of the market in fact the tech heavy NASDAQ just\nFour percent of its value today and the S. and P. five hundred ... which also has a lot of tech lost three and a third percent so it was a tough day ... day for everyone but particularly for tech\nUm now I understand that the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation rate and the Federal Reserve has said they will continue to raise rates ... that's it I Will stop raising two it's ... it's been smart rate between three and three point five percent that are there inflation fears going on\nWell well there aren't but interest rates are fears contributed to do this outrage on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks\nThat's made the market nervous in fact I this is the fifth straight day of losses for the U.S and the five hundred and rising interest rates make stocks less valuable a and there's concern in the market about just how high rates might go to the Federal Reserve\nHas said it will continue to raise rates gradually\nAnd as soon as you suggested it will stop a between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go a there are some inflation concerns but they're related to the very very strong economy we've had a unemployment at a fifty year low\nSo there's concern in the markets their wages will begin to rise more rapidly and create more inflation pressures\nOkay so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market what happened well\nThe economy is strong in the U.S and most comedies are saying today sellers is not the end of a double marketing stocks\nSo a while the U.S economy remains strong um Europe is cool to bed and so ever merging markets or the IMF gave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week than it had just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are these concerns about a global trade war a disrupting a the global economy a trade war between the world's two biggest economies are the U.S and China so what we saw\nToday is this could this be the beginning ... long downward trend\nWell most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a eight hundred and thirty points down was due to machine trading uh driven by\nWell for selling given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profit it's it's difficult to believe that the market will continue to melt down\nA but there are are are points where investors are looking over the horizon nine months to a year and wondering whether the fed rate hikes will head bring us into recession All right That's NPR's John Ydstie things done You're

U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what Saudi officials discussing 'cause she'll be\nIs is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on a show of you to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia and capture him there I think probably to show you fell to ...\nWhen you contributed WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support WBAI at Cape and islands data work\nAt the consulate and then another group that came in after a he may have been captured or met with his faith there at the consulate but it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence ... with these intercepts I eat did they warn ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know what you're up to back off ...\nWhy do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this I mean in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I\nI think there's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm has come to him and there's a real concerned about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin ... a hoot to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely jerk ... NBS says he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other in a number of occasions and there is a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe v Wade has the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports\nThe Supreme Court can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ...
