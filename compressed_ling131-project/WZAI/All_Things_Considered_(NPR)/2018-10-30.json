Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before the midterm elections\nPresident Trump is floating a new tactic and his immigration crackdown\nThe president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution\nIn an interview with X. ios Trump insisted he can change that you can definitely do with it an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order the full interview airs this weekend\nAs NPR's Joel Rose how dull hey our first just fact checked forest can the president do this most constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually that Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states is that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been in the Fourth Amendment wrong for over a century\nAnd the children were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system I know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying well Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order\nMost legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\n[noise] if President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges\nAnd it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders\nThat never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics and in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced\nThat its sending about five thousand troops

Ari Shapiro black women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats\nDoug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energize\nWe recently visited a vote or meeting organized by higher heights as a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country how do you go around and we hit the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers\nAnd the healthcare analyst who were sipping wine munching on tacos and commiserate about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hat that followed the presidential election I think that the threat was\nBy the women's march I had actually when it is [laughter]\nThis is Michelle ... she works in communications\nWhite women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did tip in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nThink our vote has been taken for granted um and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um everything that happened with that\nBlack women who delivered that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be as far away from family we show what is\nWhat is the last\nWife oh well you\nKnow and that\nList of issues important for black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice there's would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing I'm just\nI actually Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nLike I get up relationships in the middle of it because I was in the ... and the others leave office has said something\nLive well he fits the profile\nMy dad is six to my brother is six three ... we live\nLike every man in the pros\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything would be a bird's resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nIs all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara early right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress\nIs for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw it and major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that of insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most\nAnd uh Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own packed\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CBC or directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new day the\nOld way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia

be present on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with troll cereal harasser as people generally opt out\nNot many people go on line to defend against these kinds of

approval required capital one bank usa NA\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro ... let's turn now to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia at\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate in a legit scheme intended to make ... look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week and it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller\nCart does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's offices you know is usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this uh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point okay but do we know anything about this purporting plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this was a very very fishy sequence of up earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity\nDetails in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny she said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual\nWorking at the OK so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting gaining here\nThe timing is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller ahead of the vote a but there's another curious twist your the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV uh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a round the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty sit in a a theory that has since been dumped some of the news organizations that covered it have actually retracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Miller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller the bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this\nThe special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you\nThank you Ebola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months\nMore than two hundred and forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend more than thirty per week NPR's and every item and explains why this outbreak has proven difficult to end\nMonth she ... found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd yet in Iraq you have a beer young some rocks some had empty bottles idea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator of the safe burial teams they sent into the community\nWhen someone has died of Ebola at home\nOn this date the team had come to pick up the body of a child enough I'm just stepped on a boy is seven I guess there's a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the ...\nAs a team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as a team was about to put the boy into a body bag\nAnd the other last fall the boy's father he rushed in and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son taken this way\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nAll great on it was from ... to be your mother you know you're just fear the worst you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showing here will provoke grounded you're also trying to get out before someone throws over ... because you know once that happens everyone will start throwing\nOut yeah and his team did manage to drive off in time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week [noise]\nPartly it's because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people and scary plastic suits but there's another issue she's put on is a senior analyst with international crisis group\nLocal populations very distrustful of the government\nEven to this part of the ... he has a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor man he believes the ruling authorities only care about exploring the wealth for themselves\nWe haven't seen anything from the government\nPerhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area and not of the central government nor the United nations' peacekeeping force that is thousands strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children and so says put on when an authority figure be from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nTheirs are questioning whether this outbreak is even ... you know whether they're true motives that the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city had been staging street protests during which he pulled the responders are forced to hunker down and includes health workers who would normally be tracing anyone who has had contact with an infected person so the contact can be vaccinated and monitored\nWe Arthur is one of the officials tracking the Ebola epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nSo every time this harbinger tinge don't go out they don't see the contacts\nAnd the disease spreads the world Health Organization has called for more security in the operate zone but production of international crisis group says the un is trying to wind down its presence\nFeel at peace keepers and the outbreak sound right now the UN's main focus on the T. R. C. or elections that are set for December making sure the government actually holds them and doesn't crack down on opposition groups\nIn fear of that or you end up a shift pieces on the transport\nAway from the east were evil is spreading to other parts of the country have workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling\nBut the longer this goes on we may get to the point where the dampening effect that we have using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission down\nAnd then Arthur says we could move into a more explosive outbreak ...

lights no streetlights are still on in the morning as I make my way to work\nHarder for me to accept is that last swim of the summer you never know for sure which swim will be your last when the water is warmer than the air it's usually a good indicator that the season for swimming is nearing its natural and\nWhen other people locked the beach and hats and scarves and your standing at the water's edge dripping wet that's a good indicator that you're pushing it\nStop going in because you want to but because he wants to prove to yourself that you can a daily dip can transition into endurance

Know the chain and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic in his immigration crackdown\nThe president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution in an interview with X. ios Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose has all hey our first just fact check forest can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and that children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tell us what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order\nMost legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House has critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final\nDays while the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday\nSpending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico no question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration in this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term

women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats\nDoug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energize\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country how do you go around the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers\nPolitical organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commiserate about politics they actually did not know each other very well once they got settled in they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election\nThink that the threat was gone by the women's march I had I had asked you and that is\nThis this is Michelle ... she works in communications white women were divided in twenty six\nSo white women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in ... opinion now in twenty eight team it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted um and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with\nUm everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama was was black women who delivered that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate in the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be as far away from family we show what is\nWhat is the\nWife of why\nWe only and that\nList of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to\nAffect their chances of being real and ... we had a stronger voice there's would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing I'm Jewish\nI assure Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nLike I get up relationships in the middle of it because I was in the lethal and the others leave office has said something\nLive well he fits the profile\nMy ... my brother's history there are all starts with fears slim\nEvery man in the pros\nThese women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything would be a Berkes resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking\nTo the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other route feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara late right now she's making her own ... to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia\nAfrican American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you ...\nThat's it and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus is on packed\nWith the CBC ... is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB seeds are directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions about who to back and who not to back but I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country\nThis is a new day there's the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank
