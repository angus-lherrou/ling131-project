Angeles Dodgers take on the Boston Red Sox any game one of the twenty Eighteen World Series to talk about this historic match up we reached ESPN baseball analyst Jessica Mendoza he Jessica\nBook also am today [laughter]\nOkay so like just leave the stage where this battle of the team is both teams have these huge histories to the biggest fan bases how epic is this face off\nWhat's crazy also these teams have not met in the world series since Nineteen sixteen and guess who pitched games to that game for the Boston Red Sox who Babe Ruth made without Babe Ruth you might have heard\nOf him and he's a hitter but he was pitching for the Boston Red Sox not the Yankees that's how far back\n... this go okay with it yeah and they match up so it's it's also even though it's it's the historic match up it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball team somehow they missed each other when they both\nAnd in the world series it was never against each other so I Love the fact that it goes back historically but also it brings them to two thousand Eighteen\nSo was that was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart\nBroken in this case the Dodgers got it torn out and there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games that went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I met with the team in spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back in when the world series but really when you look at the field team is different because they wouldn't got many Machado I mean this is Ben they're often the leader he's at shortstop they lost Corey secret during the season so now they have a child and then really in the case I Know it's not Clinton crushed shah\nIt's Walker dealer who adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honestly one of the best picture that we've seen in the national league they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what did they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series in Thirty years you know the red Sox have had that Boston is that a lot of reason to celebrate between the patriots and the red Sox but this gene is arguably one of the best regular season teams we have ever seen\nThere were the best team in baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when it all no one cares about hey you want to have your name again yeah you get an award you get a crowd you don't get anything oh you get you won a hundred and ... yeah they were the ... they are so good out of it as we know and the post season the best you know when you got to go out and play\n[noise] All right I Want your crystal ball Jessica how do you see the world series playing out who do you think is going to win daughters\n... and that's going to shock a lot of people because of the Boston Red Sox are the best team on paper there is nobody better what I Love about the postseason transcend all of that\nTalent pitching hitting I don't care for all the numbers out yeah is redemption it's passion it's fire the Dodgers have because they live in game seven last year and I believe that's going to kill them to victory this year\nAll right that was ESPN baseball analyst Jessica Mendoza she'll be on sports center covering the world series thanks so much Jessica thank you out there [noise]\nThis is NPR News\n\nVote with two weeks until the mid term Democrats are doubling down on state races in Nevada the party is pushing to elect the first democratic governor in Twenty years\nMaking it to the U.S for NPR News I'm James Frederick in weeks left Mexico\nRight now and update on the migrant children who were separated from their families at the U.S Mexico border two hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learned welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should first said that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families but it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification\nLike one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and their reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order and where these children being held\nCity they're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are ... I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child that because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life is over ... killed on killed and this is a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents who have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum\nOr bring them back to Central America\nWe've heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have said all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited oh well we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about [noise]\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\n[noise] the ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground\nWere not giving up on the far we will find the one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us very proud of him or\n\n\n\nGood afternoon is for forty four glad to have you with us for WC eyes all things considered\nIf the world doesn't make rapid in unprecedented changes in all aspects of society a un report warned this month the effect of climate change will be dramatic\nAnd not in some distant future in the next Twenty years but even now climate change is to just starting to make its way into classrooms and a lot of teachers don't have the training or the resources they need to teach at the ...

Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id have to include street addresses has also gotten attention\n... considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities she's the head of an why use Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but what we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty times\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot that will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a ...\nUh twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of in reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purge from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are on the role\nSome cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted into into recycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening in states that used to\nBe required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election processes we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increasing the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I\nI think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that was a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much uh but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nA many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream

know about you but I have not even bother to buying a ticket because I'm a total pessimist about the lottery I don't even try any more like man I'm actually risk averse only only than he does anyone think they're really gonna win mathematically speaking the odds are ridiculously against us\nHow ever our next story is about a guy who flipped those odds over and over again here's Alex called American from our planet money podcast\nIt's Nineteen Ninety two in Virginia the pot was twenty seven million dollars\nBig for the time and when winter comes forward it seems like something is unusual that someone managed to buy every single combination of tickets to guarantee a win and this totally perplexed as the people who run the lottery system like Ken ... visit him on TV shortly after\nThe very idea of spending over seven million dollars to buy all the share of the largest seems preposterous\nThe man behind the plan was defined Monday I tracked him down a couple of years ago the last time there was a big lottery jackpot [noise]\nHe was living on an island in the south Pacific von ... hello hello Hi this is defined Mondo\nYeah he says that Virginia thing it took decades to get to that level the story starts in Romania in the late Nineteen fifties\nTo get out of the country I mean you know I\nLive in a factory I'm sixty ... among which was the tune of ... shoes\nHe decides the lottery is his way out he's a pretty natural ... so he goes to the library and he starts reading math paper aftermath paper and he realizes something about the lottery there that if he buys certain blocks of tickets in certain combination he can guarantee himself at least a second prize so he pools his money with three friends and he buys the tickets\nWe want Seventy two thousand seven on that and they could easily which was about eight years with Charlotte\nRight big score that was on your first try yeah\nHe takes the money and he leaves Romania for Australia he finds more investors he raises more money enough to buy all the combinations of numbers for the bigger Australian lottery and he turns lottery winning into a business for a while\nYou know I Want twelve times\nEventually Australia passes a law that block them from buying up all the tickets so he sets a sites on the big prizes in America\nHe decides Virginia is the place at the time there were seven point one million combinations of lottery tickets he waits until the jackpot is twenty five million or above to make sure that he's still turn a profit even if there's a split pot\nThe biggest problem with buying all the tickets though isn't money it's logistics\nFilling out millions of tickets each one different keeping track of where they are so you can find the winning tickets and then turning them all in so his secret was get the tickets ready ahead of time back then it was legal to print your own tickets already filled out so we set up printers going for over a month making the millions of tickets\nThen negotiated with stores across the state to let him turn in stacks of ten thousand tickets at a time and waited\nI knew that would lead one six second Brian I'm going to the un thousands mind right\nHe says he couldn't do it again lotteries have now added extra numbers and there are just too many combinations so the great lottery play of Nineteen Ninety two will likely state the last great lottery
