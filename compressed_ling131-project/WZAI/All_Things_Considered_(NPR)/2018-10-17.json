[noise]\nA couple of years ago scientists announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life in rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland that was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older\nAnd they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures are really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word they kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend\nScientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist\nAt NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they used a proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt pointing at at that point from the perspective of\nWhat it means a lot a lot\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half\nA chance now the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils\nSo far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word\nNell Greenfieldboyce NPR News\n[noise] and

U.S\nGeorge Parker has written about this she was a political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following those negotiations welcome back to the program color if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty ninth when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be quite severe it all depends on what kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal with\nEverybody ended up throwing places each other in person left to you in very bad dosage and indeed than you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have\nA ... you'd have checked some old goods coming in and also the u._k. which doesn't help at the moment that will quickly to huge queues the ports coming into person I'm very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out of ... trees were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very chaotic can damaging upside for the British Academy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning going on the case in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines\nThere's the fresh food road could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of formal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool\nThat will be quite bad and the pursuit call me we'll take a very big ...\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is\nA lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been some sort of stockpiling some ...\nShe's four to ... the place where there are ... you can have she's running about ... miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile keys things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that I Will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the pool so pretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what would happen in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red type at the borders and that without to business costs\nYou will make it ... percent or less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market to potential fatalities as well so the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years\nUK economy would be about eight percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hits as akin to sort of an aircraft gradually losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place than otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if UK leaves have had a deal\nWell for the rest of your this has always been something that the euro skeptics in person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European expos so they would be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's some and they won produces in France cop she says in Germany\nAnd you name it they they will be effective because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries\nBut the point is an asymmetric shock well it's true that's the other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest loses will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline that does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more or less apt to be honest I I mean we all question why yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to a very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal\nPolls have been negotiating a deal with our European partners so anything could happen but I think my ... and still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail on that will be a deal

today marijuana\nIs legal throughout Canada which raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S\nGiven that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters who had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use are around be found in the midst of all and through the United states so yeah that's awful\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you listen\nTo that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in ...\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org about whether\nThey have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burn somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation of less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admits that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today and Canada problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nState of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state the rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael my land\nFive mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach that arrived or say come\nAs like somebody's trying to get in and the inside doors shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought just hang in there and I save everything was going to be OK\nIrwin last doors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact\nThe same can be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone\nThe storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal wrote high winds lifted off roofs and knock down walls quite a few gates is the former head of FEMA and a long time member urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle in many cases\nIt's old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I called the ... or not a bunch of high rises out a lot of construction this is all generational of Florida families any of them or just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South

South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that it's sort

you'd only withstand when speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less\nFar below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael in the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the

whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools yesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race\n... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered Kate thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think these nearly treats and illusion and diversity and it left his eating missions policies change not to have faith in it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is\nPatients yeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what students for fair admissions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents burned missions as a group to ... to ... we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were scoring higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans\nAlmost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups and that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court on a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something but Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial he was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married but\nI come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at met in the context of race\nBut again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application cannot be quantify\nIt's agree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that and it said that all of that sort of have the same goal at a very city out of college campus whatever the sort of benefits that at All right but we just don't believe that we have to ... admissions and and instead focus on something like poverty has really focused on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division and said if there's any for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWell Kelly ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks for having me she's a junior at Harvard and you are listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIn\nThe afternoon

Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland that was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes\nOf life you know my thought was boy someone should fall from MIT [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like
