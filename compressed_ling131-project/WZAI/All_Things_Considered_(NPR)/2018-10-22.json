pop icon and it popularized a controversial fixture of pop music today auto tune here Steven\nThere is a long history of artist you using a different vocal modifications but is it always been a disguise you used it in ways that you would hope the audience wouldn't notice just to make of a vocal a little cleaner and clearer and more on pitch\nThis song brings the auto tune front and center city here those modification\n\nAnd it could easily have just been a gimmick instead auto tune became a very prominent tool in a lot of pop R B and hip hop production [noise]\n\nTo me auto tune sounds sort of like digital stretching are flexing your sharing a a singer kind of slide up and down the register\nIn a in a way that doesn't sound natural but auto tune can amplify an expression of passion is in or emotion in a singer\nTo me I think of a song like hide and seek by the singer image and heat or who became really really well known for for using this effect and uh and you hear hide and seek and the way they're using auto tune to manipulate\nReally feel the emotions but that song is expressing and I don't know too many people who is your that song and say what you ought to\nBe na\n... say so what you've seen in the years since his auto tune being used in kind of exciting an innovative ways and it can be misused in ways that can\nReach the the motion and love out of a out of a

sell products to other robot gotta\nGet get gotta get get gotta get that\nSo it's sort of amazing that all of this ... stuff really began in the pop music landscape with this one dance pop song from almost exactly Twenty years ago\nWhen that song originally came out all the people involved with that song actually tried to hide from the public the methods they used to create that song because they didn't necessarily want\nPeople to imitate that was like this is our gimmick and now it's just it's just so funny to see all the different permutations of what seemed at the time like this total

called a portrait of Edmund Bellamy the work was created using an algorithm and it might fetch around ten thousand dollars computer's making art is nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auction by such a prestigious art house\nNow that is new art appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the buzz around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome thank you pleasure to be here also\nHow controversial is this in the art world for a ...\nAuctioned off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine all by Marcel do shop where he literally took them then you're in and hung it on a wall right\nAnd this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what are actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is um I once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical contact\nThat is so fascinating but it does\nRaise the question of how do you price a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price and art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the saying we'll house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the voters who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the ... the collective and maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it\nAnd given that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art\nTo be auctioned off and said this is a first it is the absolute first time this has ever happened because this is a Kansas print it is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited and numbered edition after the sale\nI don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular wind because this is the first\nAaron Murray Wallace is the c._e._o. of rare ... appraisals just outside Washington

teaching students to recognize an opioid overdose and\nWhat to do anything and you know\nOhio University is using this video dramatization [laughter] you just show how ... can that drug known
