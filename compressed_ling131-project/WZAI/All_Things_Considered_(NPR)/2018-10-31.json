that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defending country that's been attacked by an unnamed invaders\nAnd what they're really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country has attacked it's seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume is fictitious invader is Russia an earlier this fall Russia had massive war games in the eastern and now it seems to be NATO's during\nThese huge military maneuvers by NATO and the Russians makes it sound like we're returning to something like the Cold War is there talk of that they're in Norway where you are\nActually already they're very careful to say this is not a new Cold War but they also admit you know the global landscape has changed and NATO's showing strength I was on the ship today speaking

one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapse\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near when it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his back she found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud

... old\nStill about one point two million to go but even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked lawyers and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt well it's technically possible\nBut it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they

sides to every story\nThroughout our poll party drives opinions more than gender which doesn't surprise Clara Wilkins a social psychologist at Washington University in St Louis\nAccording to our research it sort of the way things work when there's sort of a conflict between gender and party party wins\nThat's especially true Wilkins says for those with a strong conservative ideology\nThey're more likely to think that gains for women are losses for men and so conservative women are more likely to think that maybe men in their life are going to be hurt by the me too movement or change in\nGeneral indeed our poll shows nearly twice as many Republican women as democratic women worry that a man they care about will be unfairly accused\nAre very very time for young men in America the

its ruined a lot of guys live and they're now just as brave of them to come forward\nOn the question of false allegations are poll shows Seventy seven percent of Republicans believe their common\nBut most Democrats disagree those talking points are being used to discredit women and to weaponize this issue just simply for partisan gang attorney Deborah Katz says she ran straight into it when she represented Kevin\nWe have the president's deliberately muddying the facts to confuse people in that way giving people a pass for engaging in the behavior and it's dangerous\nUltimately Katz says the backlash will fade with time NPR Ipsos poll does shell much more consensus among young people\nFewer of those under thirty five believed that need to has gone too far fewer say they would ever consider voting for a political candidate accused of sexual misconduct and more young people said they're clear on what sexual misconduct actually means\nFor the next generation our poll suggests the

Know you've been with US Marines and on a warship today tell us about what you saw\n[noise] yeah I was as that on the U.S as a ... it's an amphibious shit as a big flight deck and the U.S Marines were actually launching heavy trucks on huge Hubbard craft and which was really striking Ari it was in the middle of a fjord snow capped mountains or they were what they were trying to do is to get vehicles on shore\nTo support thousands of troops in war games or south of here tomorrow\nNow yesterday we saw jets ship's tanks from Germany the U.S Britain and Norway all and lots of other countries all coordinating a mock assault on the shoreline here\nWhy is NATO mobilizing in such a big way right now\nYou can't ignore the context NATO spent many years is is we all know focused on counter insurgency in Afghanistan but after Russia invaded crime you're in two thousand and fourteen NATO seems to be refocusing more than its roots back here in Europe\nNow the war games that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defending country that's been attacked by an unnamed invaders\nAnd what they're really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country is attacked it's seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume is fictitious invader is Russia an earlier this fall Russia had massive war games in the east and and now it seems to be NATO stir\nThese huge military maneuvers by NATO and the Russians makes it sound like we're returning to something\nNorway where you are\nActually already they're very ... said this is not a new Cold War but they also admit you know the global landscape has changed and NATO's showing strength I was on the ship today speaking with us Admiral James ... he's head of NATO joint forces command in Naples, Italy and she said this is one of the messages\nWe can no longer expect to operate in the area of the north Atlantic with a few hundred so we may be challenged and so uh if we're challenged or we will respond to that challenge\nSo whatever all focus saying is you know if anybody's thinking of challenging NATO they need they frankly they need to think twice\nAnd of course President Trump has not been from about the U.S commitment to NATO as some of his predecessors I mean he publicly be rated some NATO member countries for not spending enough on defense is that tension playing out as these exercises unfold\nNo certainly not on the surface and there's a real emphasis on unity here in the United states heavy commitment we have Seventy five hundred Marines here I was talking to you and Stoltenberg he's the NATO secretary general he says there's a difference between the political rhetoric you here and actually the troops on the ground\nWhat we see is stunts or they're not just states is increasing its presence military presence in Europe would more forces more exercises more pre positioned equipment for the first time they're also US Marines in Norway\nIs the message here is the United states is still very very engaged in NATO\nAt NPR's Frank Langfitt joining us from Norway thanks very happy to do it All right\n[noise]\n\nThis is NPR News support comes from you and from Cape
