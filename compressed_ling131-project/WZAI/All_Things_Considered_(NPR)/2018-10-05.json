S. unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers a challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate\nI think it's a huge\nAnd house says the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern or hearing from and players if they can't find more earth that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says that's historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course has sent Connecticut implications for wages\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost paid to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor twenty three percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold on the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down load people benefit of disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade\nFormer President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration Baker who's senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates should you know I'm getting too low you have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that pace under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people on the fed and many other economists they would start to slam on the brakes got around five percent\nOr they never would've allowed it to get the slow\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News Washington

nomination to the Supreme Court and moved to a final vote\nDespite allegations of sexual assault and has passed and one year ago today with a New York times broke a bombshell story the times headline on October fifth twenty Seventeen read Harvey Weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades or one of the two reporters\nJodi Kantor and she joins me now hey there Hi how are you I'm well thank you I started here\nYou just pointed out today a picture of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the computer in the New York Times' newsroom about to hit send on the Weinstein story and you write none of us knew what was going to happen when me some thought out into the world\nWe didn't my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because of the times was doing bigger investigations of sexual harassment me knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about\nHarvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly we were reporting on Fort factory workers but you never know what's gonna happen to an investigation what when it's published and you know one of our

Court looks like he has the votes he needs to be confirmed in a final vote\nTomorrow this afternoon the last undecided Republican Susan Collins of Maine delivered a lengthy for speech she talked about Kavanaugh's qualifications for the Supreme Court before she turned to the allegations of sexual assault against him and said this\nIs the presumption of innocence and fair that do bear on my thinking and I cannot abandon them\nThen for the next twenty minutes she walked through why she ultimately believe the charges against Kavanaugh should knocked prevent him from serving on the Supreme Court her

first the headline\nIs there any suspense at this point how this confirmation fight is likely to shake out\nWell now that mansion has said that he remains I guess this is essentially they had the fifty one goes to the fifty on people who voted yes before our very likely now to vote yes tomorrow when the final confirmation vote comes up\nNow that's not to say that some crazy thing can happen between now and that it happened you know we have to keep those catty odds going but this means that the support that that we saw earlier today it seems to stand and it means that vice president Mike Pence did not appear to be needed to break any ties writes\nA role but he might have had to play had it had it not checking out quite this way today okay senator Collins as she laid out her position and the links for speech has already just said a didn't appear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote\nShe basically used her speech as a kind of closing argument did was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically we're saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is and she walked through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that she did that for more than forty minutes\nAnd she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called the gutter level political campaign instead of a solemn and he'll confirmation\nBut I'm Senator Mitch McConnell and

things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro in Chicago today a stunning verdict for the police officer who shot and killed a black teenager Jason Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder he shot in the quantum McDonald sixteen times\nIt was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the police department finding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon how this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nLove because I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with eight second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen it happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists feeling like a moment ...\nWe've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it wasn't for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during the trial what did he say\nWell he described what climate Donald ask somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening distracted either blank um he said that that that that was ... raised and light up to his shoulder um which is not something you can see looking\nSo the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of that and match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that because I think that the tension here have been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that in addition to this trial there's another trial later this shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of a chronic Donald\nA present it that night and their reports and I think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem that the community feels but also fast feeling that officers covered it up so I think\nWe'd be watching closely what happens in that trial and how the sea reacts to that as\nWe've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is rare exception what do you think made a different well\nI think the number of shots six soon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on that night who encountered the chronic Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that was important to a lot of folks that fat noticed\nThe w._b. easy reporter Shannon Heffernan reporting on the trial and conviction of Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke so guilty today of
