Dakota and we'll be speaking with a democratic senator elsewhere in the program\nI Want to bring in another voice now one of the people from Kavanaugh's past who has stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination Chad letting and went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together that when Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive that he wants ... Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face\nHe believes Kavanaugh may have lied under oath ... joins me now Hi there how are you man who I I'm All right thank you I your account has been widely reported since you came forward and released her statement this past Sunday I've just summarized it they're so let me straight to what\nYou did with this information you ended your statement saying you would go to the FBI and tell them what you knew that you\nAre yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived it had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces that they allowed\nSo you felt that this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllows cited not I was never called back I waited by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email or nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all it was like one should lie in front of the so usually committee or whether it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black now I think ... may confuse that was passing out\nBut the blackmailed phrase means doing things that you don't know you you've done and what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of who's intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nThey let me let me ask you this is a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed no I don't think they did\nPatients are really about ah what happened to me last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about like new three maybe four to five or you know college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they're going to root thorough job in that sense at all\nThat's Chad Chad letting ... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh's he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered\nFrom NPR News\nThe

planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this hike artist hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more well\nMy favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit to voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it up but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have\nBetter options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and

... gave to the FBI or that could corroborate their stories were not interviewed you say you\nYou said the affair was clearly told to narrow the report the White House and Republicans in the Senate have said the FBI was given no restrictions\nI Know from the FBI is that they are when they're told to be allowed to be very thorough following leads wherever they are to take them to conclusions and

not followed up nor were a number of tips that came into the FBI\nThe report corroborating the allegation I get a ... allegations against Kavanaugh sounds as though you're saying true but only because

Kavanaugh one of the most watched senators and that group is Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nHe's a red state Democrats who has touted his working relationship with the president and he's fighting to keep his seat in a state that Trump won overwhelmingly NPR's Sarah McCammon has been talking with voters in Charleston West Virginia\nAcross the street from Senator Joe Manchin Charleston campaign

be firing up each party's people grassroots activists but in downtown Charleston as workers stepped out for lunches and smoke breaks other issues with all of mine\nAt a diner Eddie clean says he's

Charleston [noise]\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter] this is NPR News\nThis is Steve Inskeep with NPR's MORNING EDITION our goal is to bring your news\nMatters to keep you in touch with information\nBolt can what can seem like a senseless time\nCannons to simulate those massive impact here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis [noise]\nHer work earned her a spot in this year's class of MacArthur fellows many of us call it the genius grant\nFormed after a large collusion knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet like earth is mostly rock vapor what does rock vapor\nAnd and what does it have to do with our moon\nRock vapors taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because labor as much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today\nAnd we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact so the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry as the her\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that\nGiant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that owns the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves [noise] was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] so of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the publisher paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates are amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research\nAnd I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to tests where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the moon was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today\nUnderstanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event in its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely how did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation\nIn the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've kind of kid who was always lying in the backyard starting at the stars [noise]\nI had my nose in books imagining space travel I very much enjoyed science fiction\nSo for you is studying planets a fallback to actually traveling through space to laugh\nI might be too terrified to actually go up in space [laughter] exploration and our imagination and through the laws of physics has been exciting enough for me [noise]\nSure Stewart is a planetary scientist at the University of California Davis and two days she was named to the new class of MacArthur fellows congratulations and thanks for talking with us thank you\n\n\nAnd Vicki Merrick the local food reports up now with us but hey and this time else but to get some tips on how to revive an old garden\nMy husband's grandmother kept a big garden for years roughly Fifteen by thirty feet and always filled with beans tomatoes cucumbers in peace she passed away a few years ago and the land is still in the family\nBut over the past few seasons it's been neglected and its overgrown I Want to revive it so the other day I stopped by to talk with my friend Luke ... of healthy and farm in Brewster he pointed me to a large area he didn't find this year covered and weeds that he just mowed down\nThis is the twenty by eighty I'll just cover it sick would leave mulch and leave it there and then everything underneath will died so if you know when plants don't get sunlight do basically\nSo everything underneath will basically break down the worms you know especially with that nice thick layer of mulch all the worms calm bacteria flourishing all that's double which isn't that much doubled breakdown Lucas\nUses a no till approach on his one acre farm it's a technique that's exactly what it sounds like I'm like many farmers and even home gardeners he doesn't tell his soil instead he uses mulch is to reduce erosion increase organic matter and water retention and improve nutrient cycling\nBelief mulch he uses it basically just shredded leaves dropped off by landscapers he'd rather bring it to him than to the dump where do you think is thick enough\nUm four inches you know depending a lot of stuff blows off in the winter but usually be tried tried to do before a big rain and then it kind of come packs and kind of sticks together\nUm but I've I've covered like new areas of Saud would leave mold with mulch and never told it and planted right through it so like I had to wait about a year but then I just basically brought for to kind of would raise the soil where I was gonna plant and [noise]\nUm you really don't need to tell if you're going that direction do you ever do like salt hay or see we yeah we like I'll go down this time of year and pick up some seaweed I'm just South Dakota some you'll grass and then just all just spread it like if I'm going to cover a sticker an area would stick with multiple just spread like\nYou know a couple of wheelbarrows see underneath that\nThere isn't much literature on the benefits of seaweed but old timers say it brings nutrients and trace minerals from the sea and any organic matter breaks down to add structure that's good for soil Lucas also uses silence tarps basically large black plastic tarps that block the sun and breakdown weeds\nAnd he says whether you've got an established growing area or a starting a new one this is the time of year to be getting ready\nSo they'll do so test and\nBasically just you know make sure ph is in order and then you know other stuff like that calcium stuff like that so it's easier to do in the off season so like they're really deficient something you know you have a good three or four months for it to to get it in an habits are activating and kind of correcting\nWhat the levels are in your soil can help you solve simple problems like if you don't have enough calcium your tomatoes can get blossom and dropped or if you're missing bore on your turn obsolete black and hollow in the center\nIf you test before you spread any kind of cover you can add amendment's first like if your ph was low and your soil is too acidic you could spread lime\nYou might spread compost accomplice tea or consider a winter cover crop something cold hardy like a legume or winter rye\nYou know rise good like rise not going to be putting nutrients into your soil per se so that's why a lot of people mix like a like a leg room and was winter rye peas\nClover so these are great 'cause they can climb kind of on the rise to let it gets all um but do you usually over she'd with with a leg room to fix nitrogen\nUm boats is a similar cover crop to winter rye but it it it's ... you know it's supposed to winter kill so it's not supposed to be hard enough to to make it through the winter so it's a little bit easier to deal with in the spring\nThat's what this whole approach is about putting in some work now so that when spring comes the garden is ready to be planted this past spring I clear just enough space in our family's last garden to plant a few rows of beans for drying black\nTurtle math facts and ... they were surrounded by weeds but they did well enough we've got about three quarters of dried beans from six short rows and they added some nitrogen for next season\nI was thinking we need a rotor Tiller to break ground next spring but after talking Lucas I'm going to start with a soil test and after that maybe some amendments seaweed and a thick layer of leaf mulch\nFor another UCA ice local food apart and also that hey\nIf you want to learn more about no till and low input farming who doesn't outfits recommends a book by main farmer and author will bundle on what he calls radical self reliant
