Michelle Martin Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the United States Supreme court this afternoon the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh on a vote of fifty\nEver minutes later the White House announced that he would be sworn in during a private ceremony later today NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow was in the Senate for the final vote and he's with us now from Capitol Hill it's got welcome thanks for joining a famous show so first of all set the scene for us for people who are not able to watch it\nYou know these votes are one of the most formal moments that ever happened in the Senate Senator sit at their desk and vote one by one while the vice president presides so as that was happening person after person in the gallery interrupted with visceral personal protests strip mansion\n[noise]\nCircles who spent [noise]\nSergeant at arm's will restore order and the gallery so\nThat's that's a woman yelling at Joe mansion that she was an assault or survivor that he's putting his personal politics ahead of her experience that happened over and over again another man yelled at Jeff Flake that he was a coward and all Thirteen people were removed from the gallery during the vote\nAnd I think that sums up this whole story in one scene in the Senate struggling with its formal responsibilities mean hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis\nThis has all been so partisan and divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics gets you have a sense that this anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so uh senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and just listen to some of today's concluding speeches Mazie Hirono Democrat from Hawaii says this is another case of a woman being ignored\nThat is what I I'm left with Mr President anger Harry discuss\nAnd a process that could not see the truth of what Dr for I tried to tell

and his family and disappointed than their lack of any empathy over more for what they have put them through\nWhat let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and his got because because many senators have said all along that they found Christine Blasey Ford sincere incredible and yet they effectively discounted their testimony that they talk about\nThat they did Republican after Republican was making that same argument often in in strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing bet Ford was sincere that's a word that kept coming up they said

circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh now we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford\nThe woman who told the Senate Judiciary committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago when I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether for it a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they have been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country is tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet the the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but but certainly what she has done\nA as unleash something that is going to move this country in a better direction\nAnd women across the country across the world for that matter\nI have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... ... what does professor Ford want to happen now or at least it makes you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and ... and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decisions so that those making this decision could make an informed decision with all the facts\nThat's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed because what we did not get\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support doubled UCI at Cape and islands dot org\nYou're as and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting their vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect\nOn both parties I mean there is some evidence that Republicans are now much more interested in the midterms than they had been previously Democrats or showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you what is Dr Ford think about that\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given\nA voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and\nThis is going to be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has\nRaised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and it's a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting on November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as the new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefits\nWe just have to check in with some Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nName is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old I work at Jefferson ville Indiana at Amazon so on a day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and virtually\nSo I've been at this summit center since it opened a about six years ago\nAnd I am making fourteen forty but after the pay raise goes into effect I'll be making her morale roughly sixteen and I have a son who does travel but\nMeans more sports equipment more opportunities to go to tournaments that kinda thing so for myself and my family I Would rather have the money on my paycheck now and the way the two years for my stocks to that [noise]\nI don't want to get my name but I'm a Packer at is a film that center on the west coast and I've been doing it for about a year iron Thirteen Seventy five an hour and I will be earning Fifteen or five\nAn hour oh let's concerning us mainly is were given a monthly bonus and when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles and we're worried about not getting our pay out and making less\nMy name's folks Martinez had been working on this on for the last three weeks I worked in the ... from Miami I started working in a store is the process and the company that you received a merchandise [noise]\nMain to bring the inventory a star making seven dollars for hours and now with the increase we're going to be making precinct dollars an hour after November first\nHow you feel very excited about it through because of their provider I now I can do to my farm and better quality and also I think it's more time with my family because I don't have to be looking for like a full time job is going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work out which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho are doing a raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with them you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses and particularly during the holiday season now you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nSo there have been a few reports in a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially\nDid into the company and they would get this big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company says\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money would this Fifteen dollar minimum wage than you were before\nSo I took part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase and the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees didn't know that it was coming\nAny idea why why why did they announce it so suddenly and why no\nOne is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company um Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that the conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a spate of stories are highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income number the median income was released as twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for a family of four\nNow that is a worldwide numbers what the company will point out that said this is the second most valuable company it is run by the world's wealthiest man so the contrast has been put in quite a bit of pressure for Amazon to to do something\nHome radio players will be there with our new music

McDonald fatally CBD shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's a sense\nThat this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and other people who continue to support officer Van Dyke we\nHeard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\n[noise] what would you say some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually pieces of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with Van Dyke\nOr the officers said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the fact that we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy but he's not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it's sad when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you mentioned in the park has this report it on the fact that this opened up some you know strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure\nWe're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive policing practices or after the video was released of this shooting\nThe department of justice came in and and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy in practice\nCommunities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police reform again they say this is one case\nThat we think some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what is reform look like you know what is it going to look like moving forward is this consent decree in the city is in the process of enacting a consent decree to reform the police department but is it going to be effective because there have been promises in the past\nThat the police department was going to be reformed there have been different panels for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so\nWhat's gonna happen from here\nAt ...

Washington DC the barber shop is where we gather interesting people to talk about what's in the news and what's on their mind so we're going to go back to the major story of the week the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd we've been hearing a lot from senators and spokespersons inactive is but we wanted to see if we could broaden things out to hear other conversations\nAnd we thought who better to talk to the local radio calling hosted journalists who hear directly from the audience is on a regular basis so we called Liz Redskins she's a reporter with

spectrum but I understand that you were actually telling us that the comments aren't falling neatly along the usual partisan lines tell us a little bit more\nExactly right or in the show that you're playing the comments from my question to the audience was is what's going on with\nBrett Kavanaugh and the confirmation hearings motivating you as a vote or is it influencing the way you're thinking
