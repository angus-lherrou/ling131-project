at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello\nSo the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding not surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nMoments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative\nOr even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country and she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media uh\nAnd she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this was who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical\nElection Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the solar in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is a when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nOf that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign event where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\n[noise] I guess she doesn't have it is what she does and I know\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him a beef without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nVery hard to tell A People's views the Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm votes supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or\nBut

NPR station this\nIs all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs well as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general ... who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Lewis says something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\nJust goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities in these additional\nFive thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role and know law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still still do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas creating more car barrier barriers more razor wire fencing you're crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so these soldiers were\nHousing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only in a support role again and the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used in former Confederate States in that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others uh we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border uh I don't recall the\nPresident for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past it again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who is doing everything again from constructing camps flying border patrol agents Soviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public affairs staff and uh again general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the same number of troops now in Iraq and right and maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said a border security is national security [noise]\nAll right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up to speed on the latest developments Pentagon thank you Tom\nYou're welcome in their quest to win back the house of representatives Democrats are focused on twenty five house seats currently held by Republicans in districts that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand sixteen\nFlorida Republican Carlos Curbelo is in one of those districts and he is betting that his independent reputation will attract Democrats and Republicans alike NPR's Kelsey Snell reports\nCurbelo isn't shy about confrontation hearing this summer bashing everybody\nOur line on immigration and Democrats who wouldn't cut a deal with Trump to protect people who were brought to the country illegally as children\nThey prefer the politics the petty politics of immigration instead of the solutions for immigration\nThat took her belly was spent most of the past two years he publicly opposed Trump and Republican leaders on major issues like immigration climate change in trade but he also largely voted to back the president's agenda when it comes to health care in taxes\nNow he's running for reelection in a district that Hillary Clinton won by sixteen points and he's running a campaign focused heavily on his reputation for bucking his party\nI don't remember ever apologizing for anything I've said whatever upset is what I Believe so why would I watch it by that same approach\nHelped him win in twenty sixteen but Democrats like Maria Alina Lopez who helps run the party chapter in Miami Dade see that independent\nImages and so he also taught that he's a moderate but when you see his voting record that is completely not the case and unfortunately most voters do not do that extra step and they just hear him and they say well you know he sounds good this year his opponent Democrat sending the car so Powell is trying to change that\nYou know they need information we need to provide information and access and make voting in the\nTowel isn't energetic core educator mom and an immigrant from Ecuador she's running on protecting immigrants health care and the environment all things that occur Bello says he also wants to protect their locked in a battle to convince voters who's telling the truth\nI should be ahead by fixing boys if it's a straight democratic district but it's not it's complicated\nConvincing voters who's right is a unique challenge in a diverse district that stretches from the suburbs of Miami fell through farm fields and onto the tourist hub of Key West about Seventy percent of the population is Hispanic roughly half are Cuban descent\nCurb below the son of Cuban exile gets a warm welcome from a lot of voters here he slips seamlessly between Spanish and English when he's talking to constituents and the pairs boundary pushing politics with personal attention\nTake a recent event worker Bello and Senator Marco Rubio or pushing back on Trump's new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada\nAll hardly mentioning Trump by name we walked her how strong trade relationships with our allies bought we believe that this should be fair\nThey focused on a new built out every of fruit and vegetable growers who are large\nBut like Republican tomato grower Karen Carpenter said that personal connection is important\nI mean it's hard not to like a guy like that I mean we have become so let's say five to\nDo something about the problem that affects state whose area\nAnd a festival you can I ask\nRelationships like that or the benefit of incumbency most children have to convince voters that they'll follow through on their promises that in the car so how will also worry that the people that needs to when people like those who work long hours and the service sector or tourists may not show up at fault\nIf we get our people to come out and vote I when it's going to be a close race for me my focus my campaign's focus is making sure they know who I\nI message but also getting them out to to loading type the last few days of the campaign\nWill come down to who's message voters bleep and it might help ... case that Trump himself is coming to Florida this week but not to campaign for her bell that maybe just what he needs Kelsey Snell NPR News Miami [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nI'm Annie tied to the point coming up tomorrow our series of
