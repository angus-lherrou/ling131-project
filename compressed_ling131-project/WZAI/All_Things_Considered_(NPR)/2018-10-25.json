this is all things considered I'm Audie Cornish and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the search is on for the person or persons who sent at least ten suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington the attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nSo we will identify interested person or people responsible for these acts\nOK NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts that seems like today it catches up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages\nThese are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump\nMay include former president Barack Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor and prominent Trump critic Robert Deniro had received one of the packages at an address linked to him in New York\nAnother common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded\nA or had the potential to explode cereals are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made and the FBI is assistant director William Sweeney says\nThe

reviewed some images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people and intimidate them and did that was that happening\nFor political or personal reasons all of that is a big focus this investigation or so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking

border the demonstration and sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond and become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms were going to dig into this with Wisconsin\nRepublican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border which as you know President Trump is calling a national\nEmergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that we have created incentives in our immigration system an interest partly because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is a legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding\nIn Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\nA A R I'm nobody's called a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a couple of children and I was failing units set of eyes by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nFact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I toured the golden frog countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when was the network that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen I'd never heard the term\nSpecial interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truthfully it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds as opposed we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I got I I Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with the new President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this current event might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of it is a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can end these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counter productive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from the ask you the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a prison Hernandez down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years well\nGuys aren't under my major's diction we've got it or to my master's diction because that was a move forward and and working with like college they're agree with that I could start handling and so I Try to go through this as a business person would be a problem solver\nGather the information five years or agreement in our committee where you know we all want to or we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained we want to force their laws and then we don't separate families so try to go through the problem solving process\nVery transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect to this and that may be successful breed success\nSenator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin

like a drive through the wildfires whereas like a road of distrust on either side of the road was like just\nFire them it looks like hell and realize like\nLori wheat and a professor at UMass Lowell says this is not how climate change is typically taught in high schools it's certainly not how it appears in the state standards in Massachusetts\nIt falls under the category of earth and space science which many schools either don't have the resources or the faculty or at the time to teach\nOne of the main reasons schools are left\nTrey biology or physics is that earth science is not tested on the cat the state standardized test and Chris brothers who chairs the science department at found that high school says that most schools have to prioritize what's on the test because kids have to pass it to graduate\nI remember sitting in a meeting with a bunch of biology teachers who are all advocating with ah people from the state department of education we need another science I'm cats do or schools aren't going to teach it and that's exactly what happened\n... doesn't offer earth science and high school anymore but it does offer environmental science and a class on the natural history of Cape Cod and in those classes brother says climate change comes up a fair amount\nBut could you go through a high school career without getting much I think you could depending on what science courses you took\nA twenty sixteen study from the national Center for science education found that about Seventy five percent of science teachers do teach about climate change in their classes but

and our hospital that reflects\nFlooding is something Taylor has already noticed getting worse here on the vineyard\nAnd I'm like well if this is only happening in like sixteen years\nWhat's that going to look like in Twenty years what is going to happen to all these businesses that I Know and I visit like chicken alley and the same ships and the black dog right there\nWorking directly on issues like that made off says because with the action project is all about\nLori we didn't have UMass Lowell says more schools need to be taking this kind of approach integrating climate change into every class not just one science class here and there\nUntil climate change becomes at the forefront where it becomes what we teach about\nAnd we put it in the context of biology we put climate change

Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish Megan Kelly and her NBC morning talk show may soon be off the air Kelly was hired away from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy putting comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nShow I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment by NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David Hey already so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our ... she was having a chat a couple of days ago with a several panels about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\n[laughter] you get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on the wane or black or white like that that was okay as long as you were dressed up like a character\nAnd that of course the tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by ...\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this pretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story a both by a on the NBC nightly news uh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among us\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org said she needed to do more\nShe owes a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin uh depressed the newest co host of today's show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run among um that's really nice and juniors and if it is just as ignorant and racist as the statement itself\nAh NBC News German Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well this isn't the first time making Kelly as his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw [noise]\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host much sharper edge Fox News host as she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ wore white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show has been ailing a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times the me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who retain says that ties to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet\nYou know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a cool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC\nAs she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall and a ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in a dish and she was paid an extraordinary amount of money or for a uh for the thing and she\nReally took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet Megan Kelly is ...\nReason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween after Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear round here would um we do every year uncouth which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface Avon and not allowing advent Halloween is is Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the races costume and comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us had so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well\nWalk us through some of the history of this when did we first started seeing blacks in America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds on may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like by people by talking in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course he's missile shows depicted black people with lazy as animal is to play on caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad human decision that allows slavery to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ... Olsen\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and Blackfish [noise]\n\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow face but trails of Asian American pie and think of Mickey Rooney character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy ... against them\nAnd to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nOne of the people who are caffeine caricatured often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missiles who are not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... [noise] to track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history what do you make of that [noise] [noise]\nI mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense none of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly which was talking about this and this panel is all white paint over to the port and she seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time of these conversations about race\nBecome conversations about intent and not about sort of brought a contact we always start in a store vacuuming\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nSo I'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who delivering something and who's receiving it so when he's controversy tend to happen if you read when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party dressed in blackface usually there's not a black person in attendance and no one at that party made bad an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook ... and men that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery as well maybe these conversations\nWill be better served if we spent less time parsing out what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people were not when they put on black face and more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team than kitchen thank\nYou so much Mary Louise the next like silver [laughter]\nI Hope not [noise] this\nIs NPR News\nI'm Steve Juncker I Hope you can join me for the point tomorrow morning when we discuss the local news stories of the week with some of our Reagan's leading journalists\nOr President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the U. S. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and shouldn't do Neal you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course is precisely the thing he says he wants to stop what what what's your argument\nSo actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations this goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs\nHelping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cups foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to one\nPrograms and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radios right now she wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day that we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to a home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars ... billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is the the us has some responsibility for the problems in these countries and bringing of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to central\nAmerica United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just this aid the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now\nTrans national in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them to do\nNow I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to reduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these guys\nMake those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American governments to protect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations actually much my pleasure [noise]\n\n\n\nIt's all things considered um WC AI\nI'm ... the local food reports up now with the alley furlough and this week Ellie gets to know her farmer who's running his community sharing program his own way from the ground to the market\nIn a typical C essay or community supported agriculture program a member gets a lump sum of money upfront to a farmer and then in return gets a pre packed a bag or a box of selected food usually once a week\nIt's a decent system that supports local farms and it's changed a lot of people by their food so sometimes you come across the sea as a farmer like rusty Gordon who's been growing on Martha's Vineyard for almost Thirty years rusty has seen it all including what works and doesn't work and he's come up with some different strategies that are very much his own\nYou know I worked for what will farm for over Twenty years\nAnd I ran the the operation in the u._s._a. and stuff but it was a kind of a Richard system wasn't room for error and you couldn't take extra she'd be take somebody else's stuff\nYou had to come your one day a week and you know in some time you couldn't show up or you'd forget or something so it was a there is a tough system for sure you know it was good because people really wanted to support agriculture and be part of a system like a sea of say [noise]\nBut even when I was doing it back then I knew that it just wasn't the best system I didn't think it was the best system just because so much waste as too much ... ... people not happy with what they were getting\nRusty point about waste struck a chord with me it's the main reason why I dropped out of the essays in the past there was either too much food for my household or it wasn't what I really wanted and I didn't plan well enough\nWhen rusty started ghost island farm in West his berries six years ago with his partner Sarah Crittenden they reconsidered that typical see as a model\nI think our format the way we do things it's great it's a little bit unique and the way that I'm a member countries exactly what they want so they're not bound to take anything and I think the key to this whole thing is that the zero waste that we have we don't have any way\nA member want something you know it's because they want it's not because they have to take it or they feel obligated or you know they might try they might not I think people take what they want and so you know they'll come back soon because we're not flooding them with a bag of stuff\nIn full disclosure I've been a member of ghost islands TSA for a few years now and one of the things that I like is that rusty doesn't use any chemicals and he sprays only with water\nYeah I Would never used GMO uh treated seats for sure\nEvery season rusty has his favorite vegetables that no one else that he knows that it's growing on the island\nI'm speaking relative broccoli least that we grow that few talent broccoli we've has always been really popular and um we grow a lot of that in the fall and that's coming along and that's one of the one of the hot items for sure\nHow do you cook at um you cook it like you cook any leafy green or any broccoli or when you you know it's um basically it's a unlike broccoli Robert she's in the family this is the true broccoli broccoli refund so it's a little heartier very thick very green senior stir fry it can happen anyway like like any of the greens\nThere are other reasons besides food waste that may be reluctant to join another sea essay especially goes dialing farm I think it was his hers yeah rusty drives a hearse in fact he's got two of them\nYeah I Know it was definitely a big problem I got that I got my first tourists [laughter] or maybe I think over ten years ago\nAnd at first she I wasn't using it you know on the farm and caring for people to see because I knew that that would have a lot of people have a problem with that but the truth is my pickup trucks kept breaking down and this this gold hers are lasted maybe I don't know ten or doesn't pick up trucks over a few years so I always find myself back using it 'cause I had to from a\nPractical point of view I use tourist makes sense they're well maintained and not driven hard they generally have little mileage if you get them directly from a funeral home because those guys got to keep their profile new and shiny and rest they told me about other perks to traffic stops him please let them by and he gets waved right onto the ferry\nAnd it's such a big ... big clean car you know and has all the room in the world you know the air conditioning I mean it's everything but um yeah for for sure people have definitely had a hard time with it and like I said an older couple and they would come over me and I would see like the wife ... don't buy from the sky don't we don't want to you know it was tough at first and\nYou know then as the years past people started really accepting it and they all kinds of falling then I end up getting a new person there like a really beautiful light blue classic you know new Cadillac and everyone loves it you know it's I Can't get everyone that walks by have something to say about to ask me questions more so than the food now even\nSays he forgets even driving around in ...\nDon't even have a pickup truck it's just the two horses and me you know the the older one carries all the dirt gets them you know gets all of a new or goes to the dumbbells and stuff and then the Cadillac I'm kind of does the deliveries and the farmers market and goes off island than to uh to her farm who needs horses when you versus rent\nFor WBAI local food report I'm Ellie Burleigh\nWe know you want to see pictures of

Mary Louise Kelly the search is on for the person or persons who sent at least ten suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington the attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nI can say with certainty that we will identify interested Persian or people responsible for these acts\nOK NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts it seems like today it catches up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump\nAnd they include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor and prominent Trump critic Robert De Niro had received one of the packages at an address link to him in New York\nAnother common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded a or had the potential to explode here hills are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way\nThey're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made and the FBI's assistant director William Sweeney says the powder and at least some of these on bulbs does not\nAppear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives was reviewed some images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people and intimidate them\nAnd did that with that happening for political\nFocus of this investigation or so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know investigators are focusing some resources on New York and some others in Florida\nNight at six thirty on WBAI [noise]\n[noise]\nIt is very

Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish eight hundred US troops are headed to the U.S Mexico border the ... sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants try to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond and become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican\nRon Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you ... are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border which as you know President Trump is calling a national\nEmergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that we have created incentives in our immigration system an insurance partly because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and whether a bear consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as the so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from\nThe national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I I I Know they'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is unaccompanied children and that was found units incentivized by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I toured the northern ... countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I hurt a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when was the network that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen I'd never heard the term\nSpecial interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican other than\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truth boy it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I\nI'm definitely a very fact based individual apps\nWho of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I got I\nI Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check I have a second claim with you have President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this current event might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of and it's a lot of people I Wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people come to this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy
