Indonesia\nThe state department said last week that it will no longer issue visas to the same sex partners of foreign diplomats and employees of us based international organizations\nUnless the partners are legally married before the end of the year a spokesperson from the state department said that the policy quote insurance consistent treatment between opposite sex partners and same sex partners unquote but critics point out that many of the families affected by the policy come from countries where same sex marriage is not an option\nAnd these critics argue that if those couples choose to get married in the United states they could face persecution back home but if they do not married some partners could face deportation James Wally Bruce ... is a former U.S ambassador to the Dominican Republic under President Obama and he has been speaking out about this so we called him\nAnd ... thank you so much for talking with us about your ... and one of the reasons we called you is that you had had\nFirst hand experience with navigating accreditation policy you are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican Republic where same sex marriage is not recognize how did you navigate that\nSo as we were going my husband had to go as a family member not as a spouse we were able to change his status eventually to be a member of household\nKnown as a spouse or as a spouse as other married diplomats have on on their schedule is\nOur main objective was to make sure that he had the fool immunities though that a spouse has and we were able to get that but he was never recognized completely as other spouses were and there was much discrimination based on that\nGet can you just give me an example of that\nSure I mean the first thing that happened to us when we first arrived was that the papal noon CEO who is the diplomatic representative of\nThe Vatican informed me that my husband\nBecause he was not recognized officially as a spouse or would not be invited to the reception of the diplomatic corps which he was leading for the reading of the president and the first flight of the Dominican Republic because of that non recognition as a spouse or and so that was just one of many examples where we had to fight\nTo make sure that to my husband was given the same privileges when it came to social aspects as well as legal aspects\nThis new position by the state department is a reversal of policy that had been in place since two thousand nine under secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nThe state department allowed same sex domestic partners to qualify for dependent these is now the Trump Administration says as I said earlier that this is to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that comprise two different genders how do you respond to that\nWell I say it's one of two things one it's either darn apt and really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have\nOr to the district discrimination which is what I think it is from this administration and the reason that it's different is after August filled\nThat was essential that landmark ruling the Supreme Court that recognized marriage and all fifty states so that same sex couples who now legally can be married in the U. S. throughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different\nThis is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation you know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage but you're you're not allowing that person who is a great representative for the United nations or another international organization\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of these families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president's say there's many countries were denying these is from the other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa so it creates a hearts\nBut they're not guaranteed that they're going to get these are the only way they would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow in figure out how to get married in another country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat is James Wiley Bruce ... he was in ... to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand seventeenth he's currently a principal

against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers Terence ... died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nIn a violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted movie I haven't felt she is a professor police science\nAt John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me yeah what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been this slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch\nStatistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent significant the ... percent but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about four to something off who says investors sent this something of that so from my perspective it's really what drives oh fender why this\nThey'll do is you know we don't know exactly what that I often there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know whether it's some trends that we as saying\nThat is dangerous and disturbing I Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case if you look at the most recent years we're looking more of them will she is a police officer in meditation\nAnd we're looking at an investigative activity um whereas I handling and they'll persons with mental illness so it's not perfect violations ... and ... no longer than\nThe most frequent reasons I'm for this\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it if it were\nNot people who hosts the police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to press the police are biased racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn general the climate on in the last few years is that on the police and the United states so when when you put the two together the propensity to violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus it to be going event\nThen you have the the cut us off it got to come\nSo if somebody's low can get let's take yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of a Supreme Court\nYou think police officers is pushing back\nTo demonstrate to us so somebody looking at police officers identify them is part of this ... this thought that the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because it kind of take you out and get out of the on the given police station instead you you're doing it against the\nSoviet preventative of the government was a police us\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of police officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise\nOr their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us\nHank both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are part of the ... the active it if it does definitely\nEntertaining each shoe office a frequently a sit in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that that\nIt's always a reasonable thing to do given the as particular environment and given the fed and political development that might be putting their life and then ... so this technically is how you approach and the ... and how you go to the house a well you know that if the ... who is armed and dangerous\nThe problem is that we have Eighteen thousand police agencies and when you have eight in South ... police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment stand up for training which would help us mitigate the negative perception of of policing as a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable\nThat nine officers in one year are killed in that line of duty of them out to ... to ... that was directed against them explicitly
