that says there is quote\nStrong evidence she has Native American ancestry dating back six to ten generations this is an attempt to quite a controversy it'd be a controversy that has dogged at war and for years\nAnd it comes as the Massachusetts Democrat moles a run for president in twenty twenty NPR's Asma Khalid is on the story and she is in the studio now either pay [noise]\nStart with exactly what did Elizabeth Warren released today\nShow she released the results of a DNA Analysis conducted by the Stanford University researcher his name is Carlos was to mind day and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry\nBut he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestor\n... you know in addition to this DNA Analysis one also released a campaign style video clips of President Trump mocking her mocking her claims of Native American ancestry and since then yet from her family history she had this one scene in particular where she calls ... their DNA researcher and puts him on the line\n... Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less than one of them\nNow the president wants to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts I flew out of the Native American ancestry your bedroom\nSo you you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations\nCan also here at least who one of the members of the intended audience of that video is the president himself a lady responded to although\nHe has and no one really made it but kind of a point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of daycare at a rally this summer\nTo debate her and twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said this I Want\nMeasure dollars for your favorite charity for trouble if you take the test of the shows you're too\nYou know [laughter]\nSo merely this morning we're in the ass that he pay up a million dollars he or she wants this money to go she says to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at charity ever choice\nYou know Trump was asked by reporters about this challenge he denied making that promise even though as you all heard we just heard that rate and the war in went after him again on Twitter saying you know asking him if he had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with a B aspirations we mentioned the choose eyeing a run for president herself in twenty\nTwenty I think that's a really realistic God's at this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this is really about what's next right and she has talked about\nPotentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms and she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they have been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve at that time her Republican\nOpponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had\nHis taken to calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty twenty race is going to kick off pretty much as soon as the midterms\nVery briefly has quieted all of those ...\n... no not at all I mean I can tell you real quick

infractions those violations going to have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement he was do\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states in all but two women get this one of the higher rates than men what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rules at rates we estimated often two to three times higher for what prisons classify\nAs smaller fraction petty stuff\nYou can get written up for a not closing your doors and get written up for jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just speak to your room up nice in just takes until late in value appeal the case you get written up for that that big tortilla Williams and it made up the central California women's facility inchoate show a California\nYou get written up for going out of bounds in somebody else's room\nAre out of bounds in the hallway [noise] it's just basically everything you get written up for\nShow that in California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying an order and more than twice as many for what's called disrespect\nIn Vermont we found women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments in Rhode Island they get more than three times the tickets for disobedience\nThose tickets have consequences women ...\nPrison or lose phoning visitation privileges or go to solitary confinement in Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to end up in solitary confinement for disobedience\n[noise] prisons were built for men and the rules for discipline were set up to control those math DMV ... says those rules don't work very well with women\nYou walk through a women's prison and it's a profoundly different experience we\nMet some of the day she was visiting Logan Correctional Center a women's prison in Illinois several years ago this was a top official in the Illinois department of corrections now she works with presidents as a consultant she helps them address that problem of why women in prison get just one more\nWomen are more communicative when you walk to a prison they are more emotional they want to talk to you they want to talk about their children their wanna talk about their experiences\nTwo years ago they notice helped conduct an audit of that women's prison in Illinois and found that women prisoners were disciplined almost twice as often as men for all offenses big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor insolence\nAnd they also really if they seen injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix the problem\n... told us she likes it that women prisoners are this way but she said many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say\nThey hate it the first thing that they'll tell you is these women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nCorrections officers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women push back that's where those disciplinary tickets for influence come in to women we met in Illinois told us they'd been written up some years ago for an infraction called reckless I bowling\nWhile women get more tickets than men certain women get the most tickets of all women with mental illness those who are lesbian bisexual or transgender African American women especially for those lesser non violent offenses\n... crashed into a guard out because they say it's not that to me that I like or yeah stuff like that\nWilliams was Nineteen when she went to prison in Illinois after repeated we'd missing her court ordered nine pm curfew at our foster care facility\nWilliam salt the officer was too slow to help Williams says the hardest thing was when she lost her phone privileges and she couldn't call her son he was a baby when she went to prison and he was growing up without her\nIt was sad because I miss the year I I miss her through or\nHe's nine now but Titanic Williams says that time separated often not even able to talk to him on the phone makes it hard to be a parent now\nEven today they after that or with the consequences are and they said our ... years ago on this it's it's hard right now\n'cause I didn't know other than on the air my fellow hating all backed off and my family our family like current bickering you guys are\nMore than half of women in prison or the mothers of children under the age of Eighteen one common punishment up at Illinois prison was that women last good conduct credits in one year alone twenty Fifteen women most Ninety three years of those credits that's twenty extra days or prison time for each woman\nThat's an average many women had no days at it but some ended up with months even a year or more of extra time [noise]\nA small number of states including Illinois or trying to change this they're praying what's called gender response of corrections practices\nIt's built around the idea that women are in prison for different reasons than men that they respond differently in prison and that prison rules need to recognize those differences in the last ...\nGot in trouble and found out that she can\nHave that prison in Illinois a trainer at the front of a classroom tells corrections officers to think through the different pressures in a woman's life\nAnd she needs to see what's going on with their Spanish she just asked\nMe how to deal with this moment\nWith phone privileges revoked all she can do is to write a letter home or to her son's school\nIt's reminder to the corrections officers that tickets even once for a lesser offenses can have significant consequences reporter Jessica papa back meant officers that that training they didn't want to give their names they set the agenda response of approach makes sense for them\nBut that many of their co workers are much more skeptical\nI was ... I heard a lot of things but [noise]\nWhich has been a worthless wasn't going to work as hard as I respect hug\nLetting the inmates from prison we wrote letters to some of the women that that Illinois prison\nOne woman who wrote back said that since the training started she's not seen much difference\nShe said corrections officers both men and the women are disrespectful and cruel and this is a quote there on a power trip they cause bitches hose they try to provoke you if you say anything back they send you the segregation for threats and intimidation\nThe number of women in prison is rising but still they're only about seven percent of the prison population nationwide so it's hard to get prison officials to make their problems are priority like the heavy punishment of women for those

the Cape playhouse in Nineteen twenty six then decided to build a movie theater nearby\nRaymond more it was a kind of a grandiose guy had like a lot of like big ideas and it was actually able to to execute those these ideas I mean who gets to do that\nThat's Eric heart the current owner of the Cape cinema business he says Moore was able to indulge his passion for theater and movies because he was married to a wealthy New York Eris he didn't have\nAny money is wife had the money and she went along with him on doing these projects more wanted to make a bold statement and decided to commission a large mural for the interior of the building\nYou hire New York based artist Rockwell can't who had just published a beautiful illustrated version of Moby Dick and was sort of a\nKind of like a rock star in the Nineteen thirties in terms of a lot of scenic paintings that he did around the world he spent a lot of time in Greenland and in fact he lived in Greenland with an indigenous native for a few years obviously there's not a lot to do in a place like Greenland but there is one\nBeautiful thing and that's the sky night sky and cat painted a number of our works that were related to the night sky and this is an example of that\nCan't employed a well known Broadway set designer Joe ... to work with him on executing his design it was painted in New York in I Believe one

three sections\nThe first section shows you\nKind of pressure of tourists the ball over here and then the dog is another constellation in the sky and then you look at the second section where there is a\nA nude man and a woman and they they first meet each other they come together in that part and then as you look to the third section you see one of the figures is actually handy off light\nTo the other figure it's sort of like the heavens are giving man the ability to shed light maybe shed light on the screen itself is so you get the impression that a lot of this mural is also influenced by the fact that it's going to be about a\nMovie theater Rockwell ... was at first reluctant to come to a dentist to supervise the installation of his work he was a left\nLeaning person who was very supportive of the unions and and when ... were executed in Massachusetts he swore never to come to Massachusetts\nPsycho invented the were American anarchists executed for the murder of two people

upset with aspects of the mural so that's why he spent like two or three days like making some changes and another thing that was interesting was that Joe ... actually painted his own mural in the lobby and a\nCat was so upset with that mirror that he just painted over it and why did magazine or do that I don't know I think he wanted to be sort of part of the whole project I think you know as it was like sort of two clashing egos\nKennan magazine or both signed the enormous mural although the signatures are on opposite sides of the theater perhaps reflecting that clash of egos\nAlthough the mural was restored in the Nineteen eighties years of moisture build up since then has caused the plaster behind the colorful artwork to bubble in spots record is looking to raise funds for another

G\nI Trump suggested that it could have been the work of what he called rope killers and it doesn't make it easier for the king in crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nTo stick to their denials um this despite the fact that ... was last seen going into the Saudi consulate\nAnd if you say the president of the dispatch secretary ... talked with Saudi leaders and the search the consulate today and it may be too soon to conclude is that these may be the kinds of movies you see when countries are trying to find a way out of this increasingly explosive situation\nWhen I ask you about swimming CNN is reporting today they are reporting Saudi Arabia is preparing to report that ... was killed during an ... that went wrong in other words that the Saudis might be willing to admit that he was killed a CNN citing to unnamed sources do we know anymore\nI I've heard the report certainly but I cannot confirm them at this time okay\nSo that's something to keep an eye on it to the question of of the U.S in Saudi Arabia and the relationship and whether President Trump has opened the door for Saturday to try to ... when we go out in some way I mean this is very awkward with two countries that are very strong allies\nRight you're right they um they have this very strong relationship between the two countries that cooperate on things like counter terrorism and those of us political element to this as well certainly Trump has been leaning on Saudi Arabia to keep gas prices low particularly ahead of the mid term elections\nAnd there's a multibillion dollar arms sale on the table as well which goes back to you know creating jobs here in America\nSo they may look at things like whatever happened was not ordered by Saudi leaders or perhaps it was an attempt to detain interrogate because she'll gee that went terribly wrong um but that would contradict the Saudis claims that the journalists had left the consulate safely\nI'm trying to resolve the rock of Gibraltar breaks it next time a

test dot com and from the listeners who support this NPR station\nIt's all things considered from NPR News I'm Audie Cornish and I'm Mary Louise Kelly Senator Elizabeth Warren has released the results of a DNA test that says there is quote\nStrong evidence she has Native American ancestry dating back six to ten generations this is an attempt to quiet a controversy that has dogged Warren for years\nAnd it comes as the Massachusetts Democrat ... a run for president in twenty twenty NPR's Asma Khalid is on the story and she is in the studio now either hey [noise]\nStart with exactly what did Elizabeth Warren released today\nShow she released the results of a DNA Analysis conducted by the Stanford University researcher his name is Carlos was to mind day and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry\nBut he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestry ... you know in addition to this DNA Analysis warning also released a campaign style video clips of President Trump mocking her mocking her claims of Native American ancestry and some vignettes from her family history\nShe had this one scene in particular where she called ... their DNA researcher and puts them on the line\nDid five five segments with Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less than one of them\nNow the president wants to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts [laughter] we have a Native American ancestry you're better\nSo ... you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations and can also here\nOr at least who one of members of the intended audience of that video is the president himself a lady responded to although he\nHas and no one really made it but\nYou did at him about a promise that he made a sort of daycare at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were to bait to debate her in twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said this\nIs your favorite charity for trouble if you take the test of the shows your\nYou know [laughter]\nSo merely this morning we're in the ass that he'd pay up to ... million dollars he or she wants this money to go she says to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at charity ever choice you know Trump was asked by reporters about this challenge he denied\nMaking that promise even though as you all heard we just heard or the ... and the war and went after him again on Twitter saying you know asking him if he had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with ah the aspirations we mentioned the shoes are in a run for\nPresident herself and twenty twenty I think that's a really realistic odds at this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to\nEasily win a second term as a senator this November this is really about what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms and she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they have been\nTrailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve at that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had\nHas taken a calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty twenty race is going to kick off pretty much it's in his mid term very briefly\nHas quieted all of this ...\n... no not at all I mean I just can tell you real quick the Republican National committee said that the test revealed only a miniscule percentage of Native American ancestry that still leaves a lot of unanswered questions All right so that is NPR's political correspondent Asma Khalid\nThanks very much You're welcome voting rights are on the ballot this
