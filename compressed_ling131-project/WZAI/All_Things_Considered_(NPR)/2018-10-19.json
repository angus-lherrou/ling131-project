correspondent Tamara Keith hate him high so why is President Trump talking about another caravan at a political rally think\nWell this is not the first time he has talked about caravans he talked about a different caravan back in April a this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news\nAnd so he is talking about it again he suggested at that rally without offering any evidence um made a claim that Democrats were somehow behind the caravan\nBut they wanted the ... and there are those the caravan didn't just shop and it didn't just happen [noise] a lot of reasons Jarvis four thousand people but I just want to the Mexican government is because they're so good hopefully before it ever do [noise]\nWe should underscore that there's really no evidence to back up this conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that it's something that gets his supporters animated\nYou know they are still at these rallies chanting build the wall almost every ... every time he was out there so basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and

in full cooperation with the Saudis NPR's Peter Kenyon has more on what the sensational electric murder means for turkey the Saudis and the U.S\nThe latest leak say Saudi vehicles were attractive they left the consulate after ... entered on October second one traveled to a coastal district on\nThe sea of Marmara while another headed into a forest in the northeastern part of the city Turkish media say parts of the forest have been searched as head of the consulate the consul general's residence and diplomatic vehicles studying audio and video recordings the leaks suggest because she'll do was tortured killed and cut to pieces\nPossibly by Fifteen men Saudi team that arrived at the consulate just ahead of the show ...\nPresident Donald Trump says he requested a copy of Turkey's audio

recordings\nHe's heard through an interpreter are given this guy that\nWe did read the news about Trump asking for the audio recording from turkey but we didn't give any audio recordings to pump pale or any other American officials were waiting for the outcome of the investigation that was launched by our stumbled prosecutor's office\nSay from the beginning Turkey's attempt to present this as a straightforward criminal investigation was undermined by its invitation to the Saudis to join in\nSaudi investigators have been in on every major search so far sometimes you're writing well ahead of the Turkish team us based turkey analyst Soner chapter I told the al Jazeera networks English Channel that Turkish president ... needs to see this late at the doorstep of someone\nI think at this stage a Turkish president aired on can take nothing less than not just a complete apology but or someone pretty significant and important uh thrown under the bus\nPotential candidates for blame have emerged in the media suggesting an effort is underway to shield crown prince Mohammed bin ... from responsibility\nPersian Gulf analyst Simon Henderson at the Washington Institute for Near East policy says turkey can ignore that could show was engaged to a Turkish woman and that whatever happened took place in Turkey despite the diplomatic status afforded the Saudi consulate\nIt doesn't have

Washington the US's counted on the house is out as a key Gulf ally especially with Trump about to reimpose sanctions on Iran aimed at removing Iranian oil and gas exports from the market\nAnderson says that move could now becoming an awkward\nMoment there'd been before foods when sanctions on Iran a increased again and the the premise is that Saudi Arabia makes up the difference continuing stability in the world oil market but at the moment that question might be being reopened\nThe Saudi ability to drive up world oil prices is just one factor that makes ... fate something more than an ordinary criminal case Peter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWe're going to speak next to someone that skeptical of those Saudi and Turkish efforts to investigate ... death skeptical that the Saudis are likely to carry out a thorough and transparent investigation of themselves [noise]\nHe is David Cay he's the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression\nWhich means he's tasked with protecting those right around the world David Cay once the UN to launch an independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome\nThank you it's good to be her walk me through how this would work court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate could showcased disappearance and perhaps murder\nKnow it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before\nWe've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts maybe led by a former prosecutor and they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the conflict\nHe has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it\nPretty quickly I think and we are talking a team of what size roughly theoretically theoretically maximum five people [noise]\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work could show she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago he said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's at the Saudi consulate\nAre you confident you would get access to the places you need to go with the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation it's I mean it's a great question\nOf course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general's\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed\nIt might not even be as relevant but getting access to the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leaking to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen\nAnd then what happens at the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find\nOf course they couldn't ignore it I think that would be something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think is a credible independent investigation something that\nThe Saudis can't do because they can investigate themselves the U.S evidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible it'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with a simply reports in the press and ideas of\nThe Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not a that's not a credible investigation\n[noise] so you say you can do this you say you want to do those why isn't it happening\nShould happen there's a lot of politics around that the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution that was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for holding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by a number of states those included\nStates like France um those are the states that I Would look to first uh to to move this kind of thing forward\nDavid Cay he is un special ... on freedom of opinion and expression and thanks very much thank you [noise]\nThis is NPR News\n\nNew as Saudi ties we take a closer look there's the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of your mouth crucial ... Buss credited Trump pitch the campaign trail and us mercenaries\nFor hikes the M ward definitely worse because they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party he mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district at the knock on doors [noise] I'm\nOnly going to take some time I was on the river on the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nYeah that is how I feel that people focus too much on the people calling from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in short of parents are from Mexico\nUm this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of an opportunity I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize as the people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not\nFootball ten years from now this sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration switching\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection aj Doug ... on the ballot and its Doug do she's agenda\nDo see hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt wasn't the ads to approach do the for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting that border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic if Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way cheetah\nThey see what's going on to see how they treated us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to vote you got to was a vote and they said that we were ready to go over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate\nGovernor juicy well be appearing on

of the Roger Williams University School of law in Bristol Rhode Island\nAbout some of the legal issues in this case Michael ... thanks for taking the time to speak with me my pleasure and Michael a big\nIssue in this case is whether the fall river city charter contains language that would allow the city council to remove mayor career from office or earlier this week the council took no action on that I Wonder if you could explain a little bit about what the language specifies and why maybe there's a bit of confusion about what it might allow the city council to do or not do\nThe charter has a section in titles a temporary absence of the mayor and the specific language is that\nWhenever by reason of sickness or other cause the mayor is unable to perform duties of the office that the city council could vote [laughter] take a leave\nMayor Korea's lawyers and the lawyer for the city or have taken the position that that provision when it refers to the inability to perform the duties of the office refers to inability caused by\nSickness or some kind of physical or mental disability and not\nThat he might be unable to performance duties because he's distracted by the fact that he has to defend himself\nUh against these federal charges um so that's the ambiguity um that the city council and the lawyers for the city or are wrestling with\nIs there any sort of precedent in Fall River for this sort of thing is that I knew there was a recall effort a with a former mayor of Flint again but is there any kind of president for this specific type of thing\nIt doesn't appear that there is um there are certainly none that I Know of a that this provision as sort of being read it may be litigated for the first time\nMichael what do you think this case is ultimately going to hinge on\nIt seems like the dispute is going to be around whether this was a typical start up venture\nGone bad an attempt to start something create something gone bad\nThat's not necessarily fraud fact that's not fraud what's a what's fraud is in the course of trying to create this thing he started to steal money from investors than we've got a fraud\nMichael you'll know ski is dean of the Roger Williams

America for refuge in the United states have been mast and where today they broke through an immigration barrier and tried to enter Mexico from Guatemala\nMexican security forces appealed for order and then fired tear gas to drive the migrants back\nPresident Trump has already weight in he's saying to Mexico for its efforts to stop these so called caravan he has also said he will close the\nSo let's bring in a reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala Hi James\nI'm Mary Louise so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calm scene at the border a lot of security but migrants who were amassed a few minutes away from the border what what happened today\nOr this group of migrants that has now grown to ... and we don't know exactly how many uh but thousands of migrants now decided they were going to march to this bridge that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today\nIt was a very chaotic scene but uh you know if I can just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence blocking them from leaving Guatemala they got through that fence thousands of people started a walking across this bridge into Mexico Mexico hits close up big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for this caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using against migrants and then the gate shut again\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from this father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\n'cause I don't feel comfortable with him on the [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out she had to pour water in his children's eyes they got pure desk it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was a it was a really rough seen speaking\nOf the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you [noise]\nSo I'm back on the bottom all inside of the border but still writes here uh near the bridge and and several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far have drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right next to a couple of cops are from Guatemalan Red Cross they're treating people mostly people who are really just\nHydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cutting hours probably four years old has a\nHas a cold rag on his head so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who said suffered a lot of\nHeat stroke a and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the classroom Mexican\nAs you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross\nA lot of people I talked to said we are going to leave this bridge what they are requesting is from Mexico to let them and\nAs asylum seekers and so many of them said we are not going to lead the Brits were going to block the bridge into Mexico lactose and given the clashes that Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to get close to everyone\nUh so it's it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we're not going home\nIn the seconds we have left tombs I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and advance getting to the U.S is if the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position [noise] they\nThey are aware of the uh Trump does not want to let them into their country for what they say over and over again as we know that's his stance but we're asking we are pleading for help because you know whatever Trump puts in front of us what in fact at home is worse than whatever Trump and put in front\nThank you that

flawed in its procedure here's West Virginia house speaker Roger ...\nWe believe it it will do irreparable damage to the cost like they were affected like gravity separation\n... who helped oversee

a broke the law and has been found guilty of it and they weren't good with that they weren't just good with that they went further and they wanted to take out the entire court\nWith impeachment trials on hold the Senate says they plan to ask the ad hoc court to reconsider its position the other option would be to start the process all over in the house about ... the constitutional law professor says he won't speculate on the outcome\nI'm not very good at projecting what will happen in an instant in situation which is highly politically charged and of course we're on the cusp of an election

wall almost every ... every time he's out there so basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and vote yeah and the evidence is that it's a winning issue there are two

Washington and I melted Chang in Phoenix, Arizona President Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now both US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they're all Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latinos will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state\nAnd to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called ... it's about eighty percent Latino [noise]\n\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out got as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who had to give the Republican some\nWays is hands are home especially in Hispanic community is the way Trump wants to run the U.S\nRamon bearing owns a small business repairing floors he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump's stand\nFor security for her you know you need certain order and in your home\nYou know the issues that came with the wall\nYou know building a wall doesn't get any of it is a good idea\nBecause I just installed not even two weeks\nI already have a door but I Would have better doors when you're a ... year old son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow that door makes me feel safer\nIt made me think you know that you know it doesn't make sense more more medals they're keeps\nThe worst people out you know [noise]\nBut step outside and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently disagree with parents like evil Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news or coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a ... status you seem to kissed been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party you ask me I mean who soaring all that you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is no reason Hernandez has view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\n... heads the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty eight team could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen\nI'm not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern Phoenix and the district of state representative Tony Rivera have any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say well they'll say um how could you be a\nRepublican and when the Republicans don't support 'em Hispanics it all support immigration reform\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party he mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocked on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some time\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised a jury of parents are from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of an opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize as a people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who were coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is that I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans were trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor ... who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection Doug ... on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt wouldn't be as you approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for he is\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am vouch for Doug juice\nBut under that logic it Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThey see what's going on to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to vote you got to ... vote and they said that we were we're ready to go where they were over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come\nAnd as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party governor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR
