registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years\nTo um put voters on pending lists until they could be ... come fully registered and then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this

secretary of state's office says other states have this kind of law including Florida and in Florida any way of federal court upheld the law\nAnd activists are saying that this life it's proportionally affecting minority voters how have they made that case deal\nWell it is true um if you look at the list of he's fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular which he knows and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nRange and running for governor he's also the

election\nWhat's the mood in Georgia right now so close to the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and this particular case is\nDemocrats who feel that Republicans are cracking down on voting

Hudson New York Julie a craven of the Hubble posters on the line from Washington D. C. and last but not least Rodney Carmichael from NPR Music is joining us via Skype from Atlanta\nHave her body was a he has it gone right now I'm gonna start with you sir because I Know at some point you were a big ... fan maybe you still are um and we know he's always been provocative he's always been unpredictable but this\nWas on another level and it was in the oval office\nWhat was your reaction to what went down on Thursday\nIt was so surreal dislike I'm taking up the phone from get out or something I don't know I was once upon a time you noticed down was borrowed currently has been happening for a couple of years so what happened this week especially after the per year was not that much of a surprise\nAs easy as it is to kind of laugh about it and imagine it as some kind of entertaining thing I think we've got to take this seriously I think it's really dangerous the kind of rhetoric that he is now and\nI feel like in a lot of ways he is a reflection of Trump as a candidate in twenty foods thing and it was really easy to laugh about 'em into election not you know\n... Julia what do you think I mean is now the time to be taking ... seriously\nIf you haven't been taking ... seriously you should start taking him seriously now um I agree with everything right and he just said this is not performance art he's not doing this to be provocative he's not doing this to sell albums it's very clear\nHe even said that racism wasn't a deal breaker for him and\nAs a former ... myself that's really sad coming from the guy who said that George Bush doesn't care about black people after the fallout from Hurricane Katrina so I completely agree with Rodney we need to take this seriously this is a man who has reached yes fans his fans follow him they're influenced by him\nAnd he is supporting a president that is arguably just blatantly races\nBecause I'm going to throw

on Sunday night she posted a photograph of herself to Instagram and and the caption she talked about the fact\nThat she was coming out for the first time and vocalizing her political beliefs she endorsed two candidates in Tennessee Phil Bredesen who is a candidate for the Senate he's the former governor of Tennessee\nAnd Jim Cooper who's a sitting congressman up for re election in November but the main thrust of her Instagram post was about why she's not voting for Marsha Blackburn who's a female candidate in the race she said she likes to support women who are running for office\nBut she couldn't support Marsha Blackburn because a lot of the policies that black but has supported in Congress\nUm she said they're not hurt Tennessee values\nAnd high profile Republicans were not happy with her right Mike Huckabee tweeted something about her fans being too young to vote so oh well so what but I mean there was a lot of like negative reaction from high profile Republicans\nDirty

program thank you for having me and us [laughter] we're out of here [laughter] I Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify\nMost with all of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a pimp there are a couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who object to find women with a former cop who admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he said\nWell I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different\nConversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worth and value are determined by my parents and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in queuing day or with social media\nAnd I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have begun smelled on this side and\nYou know what does healthy sexuality look like as\nA woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve earn more\nBut who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it looked like to trade on my appearance and being a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex us as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nThere was definitely the space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that human body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself and that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trans gods of the theater and of accident and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters\nA woman and the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I have a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with\nAn accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignities of having accented English actually does means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love kind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so individual and us how to do is when do United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places on for so long but then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material\nOn during the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and he said but he called cracking good job\nShe's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that chief it didn't quite a bit so you know I really try to set my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says\nI feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nWell I think like so many of us in today's culture I come from a mixed upbringing experience my family was black and white him on my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American\nAnd we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives that people's who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of a pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is and you talk white you this that and I heard a lot of that and gradually I learned to stop fearing\nShards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am [noise]\nThat's Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much thank you ... oh my pleasure our pleasure\nAnd finally today we are going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called codes which is all about race and identity in America\nAnd in our most recent episode we talked about adoption specifically trans racial adoption most adoptive parents in the U.S are white and a lot of them are adopting children who aren't\nAs according to the Institute on family studies so we put out a call to those of you who are adopted we wanted to know how did adoption form your sense of racial identity and your sense of self and here's what you told us\nI spent the first twelve years of my life thinking that I was a little white girl and when I found out
