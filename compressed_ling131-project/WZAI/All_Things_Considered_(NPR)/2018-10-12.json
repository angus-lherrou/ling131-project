an outfit Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida or Easter industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today\nFor hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove into day my producer Becky Sullivan I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood\nA here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble I'm somewhat already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region\nIn this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affecting it runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckled under wash them and a half an hour yeah yeah I watched it out\nThere is also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now just single lane\nBut that said there is now a pathway through apple logical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but ... no power no ... very limited cell service and no outside help yeah\nWell and and I mentioned these two towns are the hardest waster industry they've got fishing going on there a lot of fishing and ... they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nRight I mean ... along the mainstay there but they've had hard

NPR\nNews this is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nToday in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made pastor Brunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible you could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there I'm Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell he's passed around a small church in is mayor in western turkey for years and years a\nBut after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric ... who turkey blamed for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless\nBut he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now and then today in court we had three witnesses who would testify against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge has basically suspended the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this clerk for to the ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with air to one and reportedly Trump Saudi\nInstead he was simply moved to house arrest then the U.S got tougher they live a sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's districts that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey\nWill lay re raised this issue of extradite him declared for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing the stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he has Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does and I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new price of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why ships getting more expensive at a time when corn\nIs getting cheaper clue number one Fritos it's owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ...\nHe's all Pepsi products and all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a well luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted to offset increases we received in product costs from manufacturers so present with wholesale cost of the free does have gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how\nNaive to think that's all that ... is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do as well\nFood prices killed is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation\nBecause trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more we just did the shipping costs were not acting alone\nSo on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi\nAnd he gave us another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies I Know one of them um because of the parent has gone up as well\nSo because of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers\nSo the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices above the company's Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs that maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but\nThey can't really do that right now sales of so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking category alive many of the other hand categories\n... that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks at your best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying\nIt's not as satisfying as a bag of Doritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise] that's good for [noise] that\nWas NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie cast the\nIndicator from Planet Money [noise] support for planet\nMoney comes from transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses used transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries more at transfer wise dot com or from their ...

to be hitting the court not a player\nAs she is right the athletic ran who may is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic Clyde\nAnd it was a shooting was made famous by New York Knicks great wall Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go into ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going good\nSo why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a in Ninety eight and it was very short lived they find just one clear and a quarter and yoga broker after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball\nBasketball's always had these elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hasn't so I'll come with a big part of the appeal what's happening in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also\nI think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how to pull do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer yeah um you know I did a lot of research last year like you had about ... percent of the week wearing the issue was loud oh okay I'll step in combat that is pretty tough but okay [laughter] yeah they\nDo have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed six of the talk Fifteen draft picks this year along with all darned ... cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of it\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like ... like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases the guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's gotten a chance to check out the hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever [laughter] and it's very on corporate life but I think people have said that and MIT's meta kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue brand name what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more and what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights audience ... like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys up 'til the sun\nHave six and a half million wind followers on Instagram so that's a huge base as the brand of starting out you know I think the brand itself is only had a couple of hundred thousand followers so\nThey're really leaning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their shoes that they don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for sure\n[laughter] ... covers the athletic she industry for ESPN takes them I'd sneak die

leverage is all relevant data to deliver answers to complex business issues\nTara data dot com and from the sustaining members of this NPR station\nIt's all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse while at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report\nPennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro birds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step\nA given what the rangers uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church I think what's missing here though is and the knowledge meant by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania\nAnd then bishop worlds role in it\nNow I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their parishioners but I I Do not think that the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal ...\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal release today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggests\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nJess that then bishop we're all did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop we're all played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nThat what they're supposed to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two\nFifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone\nTo come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes reviving this statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institution where\nYou hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve\nI think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on but the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is\nIs you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique in critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania\nJosh Shapiro is Pennsylvania's state attorney general thank you very much for joining us\nThank you [noise] some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers

President Bill Clinton base was looking for a precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referrals to Congress\nThe national archives let me see a lot of uh from the Watergate special that was very interesting but what I asked you to load it up to the house I or if they said no\nBates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry shortstop it's relevant is\nForensic ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material\nBut there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public record urgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public\nJohn sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nFrom twenty

billion dollars in New arms sales to Saudi Arabia although many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for American\nAnother facet of the fallout over the drawl cause shaggy [noise] situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunge Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed has gone crazy I think the fed is out of control of what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also\nSo how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this it's\nVery unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry should an often voice displeasure with\nTerry policy and maybe didn't call the crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials happened defending the sad from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fat Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself uh with the elected representatives and the public\nI think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president and house way the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nAre no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis information\nUsing the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending all are\nI think is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks and others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it does a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests like you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power\nIt's on Capitol Hill trying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's\nGroup why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's as well as explaining to the American people I think that's the basic insulation for the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nThat's Donald tone the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today your walk 'em out so thank you for having me on

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made a pastor Brunson case a priority and Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely to moral as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there Hi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first\nPlace and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell he's passed around a small church and is mayor in western turkey for years and years a\nBut after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for two Gulen turkey blames for that coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless\nBut he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now and then today in court we had three witnesses who would testified against him suddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge has basically suspended the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with everyone and reportedly drunk thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement ... the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's districts that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted\nBut will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extradite him the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing

with tunnels reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nIt was my attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he asked Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into what they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money and a trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working\nOn a story about the following price of corn\nThe middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to by myself\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nJurors had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper\nClue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi own tree to lay which makes ... in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products and all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they\nWould not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a well luckily there was a second clue a note lasted the scene of the\nCrime to our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted to offset increases we've received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost of the free does have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things that are free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that's in a bag or Fritos Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a processed food like Fritos has almost nothing to do with well\nFood prices counts as a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all
