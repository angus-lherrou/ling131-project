put\nFor a while later Superman\nUber man it's a favorite superhero it went on like that for quite a while All right NPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe joins us now from the White House to make a complete total sense out of all of this hey how ya hello let's start with the why why with Kanye even there today he\nWas a here because he is a big supporter of President Trump he and Trump\nThey've been exchanging compliments for a while it it really picked up after west war the make America great again hat on Saturday Night live which was controversial and west had a lot of praise for Trump in the oval office here's some more of what he had to say\nWhat I mean Saturday Night live to prove auto it on the liberals improve on or if you don't look good\nWe don't look good this is\nWent was joined at that meeting by legendary football player Jim Brown and and try really he talks about west in brown on a regular basis or because they are two of his highest profile African American supporters are\nAnd Trump claims that west coming out in support of them has boosted his standing in the African with the African American community and now Trump has an offered any real evidence of that but that's what he says\nAnd what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter is he will mention Kanye West or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and these other economic indicators that are better for black people\nAnd he basically said that people like west and brown quote get it and they see the benefits of backing him\nOkay so how about the conversation to even know what they talked about today\nWe're supposed to talk about a lot of things in some of them very serious like investing in urban communities addressing crime and violence to Chicago and about clemency and on the issue of clemency in criminal justice reform of those have been priorities for none other than Jared Kushner and the White House uh and because of that focus there's some overlap with some of West\nUh his wife has already been working with the Trump Administration on these issues she's been to the White House on two occasions and she successfully advocated for clemency for a woman who had been given a life sentence for first time drug than what was the main message that kind of us wanted to bring on criminal justice reform\nWhat he seemed to talk about politically was that a\nAbout the free of Larry Hoover who was a leader and a founder of the Chicago gain gangster disciples who is now in supermax prison starving multiple life then it said\nUh this is the case that it's different from usually the case of that prison at Purdue form advocate usually like to highlight they like to look at people who are more ... uh who have committed non violent offenses and ah maybe got really extreme sentences\nUh but uh we really don't know what's going to come out of this and whether this might just be more of a photo op for west and drop All right That's NPR's Ayesha Rascoe thank you I used to thank you [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nOne voter in a poor Kentucky counties that she is doing well under President Trump and she

company my heritage wandered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful the technique to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than six percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people that database or white\nEach person in the debate as it because that illuminate hundreds of these things with these\nCousins or your second cousins once removed in the debate as to actually identify you the same way that a GPS than you did multiples because I like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and how old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological record you need to do the war but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify and supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on the national institutes of health research database raising questions about how ... these supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese techniques doesn't only can get you ... you can catch criminals with these technique but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be using to commit\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police to cover the using these techniques to find the media like you know ... and\n... people but uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know the political demonstration\nThat lifting DNA behind a wheel K really if foreign governments are going to exploited the technique to identify us I think that for their own purposes so that there are many scenarios that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defending the use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... which helps police solve crimes is way\nWe're working on these cases that haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're her effect in murders of children things like that it just [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd grey tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is in New York University law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your tips and cut in for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump and rapper Kanye West met for lunch today\nOne topic on their agenda was gun violence in Chicago and what to do about it the president's ideas on this are very different from what reformers and local leaders are trying to do it different that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports Chicago's had a rough\nFew years in twenty sixteen murders jump to the highest rate in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there has fallen some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nI Am director the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave when to straighten it out on to straighten it out fast is no reason for what's going on there [noise]\nBut what that means it turns out the opposition\nThe administration is filing a brief with a federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intensive policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems like\nChicago [noise] it was meant for\nStop and frisk [noise] from says\nWidespread stopping and frisky potential criminals reduce crime\nThat conclusion is contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forums justifying their stopped which has led to fewer stops the administration believes the sort of court ordered limit\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support double UCI at Cape and islands dot org\nMadigan as the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nOr if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they are getting out and therefore ... nothing\nShe regards the consent decree as unnecessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word is just to move those stop and frisk\nHe's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing\nIt galls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nIf we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias and racial bias has to be attacked but certain neighborhoods need more policing\nMany policing experts these days lament what they see as a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing in Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric\nAsked about it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed out at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously\nYou guys even in the stories acknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like ab loving little mice chasing every time Donald Trump said something it doesn't have any value\nTrump's opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the administration's brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but on Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real highlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers\nMartin ... NPR News\nThank God the crew in a live those were the words from it in for Russian President Vladimir ... after a Russian Soyuz rocket carrying two astronaut to the international space station failed during and today\nAt liftoff had proceeded smoothly for about two minutes then came in real life drama\n\nHere it's like five to seven am I found out of the [noise]\nThe crew American the tank and Russian Alexei ... are safe after an emergency landing in context on three other astronauts are currently on board the space station and now they're returned home might be delayed\nFor more on all of that we are joined by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield Easter ... commander of the international space station in twenty Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian ... capsule welcome\nThank you nice to be talking with you also\nSo this was going to the American Nikkei for time into the second for like ... ... what kind of training would they had had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as cosmonauts for quite a while as you say with space flight experience nip prior to being an astronaut\nA test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launch anyone working together for a couple of years we wring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong\nAnd the way the crew behave there were so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to how Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely actor\nWhen would be the next you know you could go on a mission like this again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused in professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kind of mad because they didn't get to go to the base today you know kind of like\nGosh all that preparation you into that but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again very fun I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be\nAll of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem of manufacturing problem who knows\nThat and once you know that you can fix it then you can set a timeline if that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years then\nBuilding a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... to the space station it's sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want ah okay but if they ... to come home than they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough ship\nThat after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them\nSo it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on and\nSo people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander of the international space station thank you very much for joining us today\nNice to talk of the aisle so thank you [noise]\nThat is NPR News\n\nThe junk or I Hope you can join the point tomorrow morning when we discuss the top of local news stories of the week with some of our region leading journalists among the stories will talk

mean the reports are being stores to Turkish officials Turkish investigator saying that this team of Fifteen people flew in on private planes with the express purpose of targeting ... that just seems like a massive operation to take out one editor\nIt sounds so crazy that it's hard to get your head around it that Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics can you imagine that this actually happened in the way that Turkish officials say it did\nYes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people have been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifferent says almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense\nAnd if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this direction it seems that this is the most plausible scenario [noise]\nMy pleasure Shadi Hamid is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution we have been talking about\nSaudi

NPR News the state department\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News I'm\n\nThe local ... on the local food report we're always thinking and talking about why we make the show every week turns out a big part of that is love a love of food and the labor and traditions involved\nThis time else potatoes and Eli ... talk about putting up the harvest and how this passion nurtures relationships and different ways to honor the bounty first you'll hear from ... done alley\nMy grandmother was a Cantor and my mother and my great grandmother before them when my grandmother decided she was done cooking a few years before her death at Ninety seven she gave me her recipe book and walked me through each one to make sure I Would remember the traditions here's my grandmother by\nAlthough wasn't my recipe came down from my father's family the plumber family green tomato pickle the only way I can describe the green tomatoes pickles was that if you had a beautiful slideshow roast beef\nOr a good piece of steak all you needed the side it was some of that green tomato pickle\nMy grandmother taught me to make green tomato pickles in the fall this time of year just as the seasons are starting to change and in early summer making strawberry jam with my parents brings me home to Maine every year\nA few months ago a good friend moved two hours away but we've already seen each other four or five times because our relationship was built on food and every month or so we're getting together to put up peaches or can't salsa or go blueberry picking or ... a big batch of kimchi\nI think a lot of putting up the harvest is about those relationships family and friends for instance I'd love to learn how to can I've read about it but it's not something I'm doing because I really feel like I Need to learn it from someone else on the other hand it's also nice to know the farmers I have a couple of ...\nBirds and the other week I ended up with fifty pounds of fresh carcasses bones for short money because they weren't going to use them so I got to make stock all day lots and lots of stock for my freezer\nI Love taking it day to do something like make stock or Kim chi are jammed my mom strawberry jam takes an entire day we have to find a day at the right time during strawberries season and we all have to dedicate ourselves to stopping and making jam on that day\nSo many people's lives ours included are fragmented and for me it's both challenging and incredibly important for both my pantry and my relationships to find this uninterrupted time for food processing\nIt's almost an instinct to put up food when I feel especially compelling this time of year when the seasons change for me I Love the process like making all that stock it's good work it satisfying and a comfort to me to have a freezer full and ready to cook with [noise]\nI also like to put up the harvest in unexpected ways in places like syrups and oils vinegar and liquors binds using those things with berries tomatoes chilies are herbs lemon grass or ... cooking with a bright blueberry vinegar in the dead of winter always brings back memories of my summer kitchen\nMy babysitter this summer from ... in Mexico or different and all sorts of ways and we sometimes have trouble communicating but we connect in the kitchen\nIt turns out she's studying food conservation and she's helped me with all kinds of freezing and canning projects a few weeks ago I came home and she turned to a bag of drag car and I didn't know how to use into ... and then ... and finally tortillas and and but not us\nTo her was no big deal to me it was revolutionary\nI Love that and I know I get stuck in the expectations of what putting up the harvest means or how much in terms of quantity you have to make I discovered it can be just a little bit like a quarter of this a pound of that and there's so many ingredients to choose from like that Dr corn for example and there's always new kitchen wisdom to pick up\nI remember going to a dinner party awhile ago some people we just met invited us over and there was that getting to know when another social awkwardness but after delicious meal when I saw the host collecting bones of people's plates and putting them in the freezer to make stock for later I knew we'd become best friends\nFor WC as local food report I'm alley
