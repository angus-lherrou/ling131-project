double you ca I\nIs all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin we're going to start this program and turkey because a day after Saudi Arabia confirmed the death of journalist ... ...\nContinuing its investigation into the killing yesterday the Saudi Government abandoned its earlier claim that it had no idea what happened to ... he was last seen after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month\nTurkish investigators said he was killed inside the consulate and that his body was mutilated the new Saudi version of events as a journalist was killed after a fight broke out between him and unnamed people inside the consulate\nNPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul\nThe Saudi acknowledgement ... died inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin ... they know that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings for ten days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to assemble the same day 'cause showed you arrived at the consulate there are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body President Trump said he found the Saturday account of what happened credible\nHe also said the fight and accidental death is just a theory that's being thrown out and he doesn't want to use arms sales to the Saudis as retribution\nFor a hundred and fifty million dollars a hundred and ten million of which is military order for this district court Vincent various things order from Saudi Arabia\nFor a hundred and fifty million dollars I think it's over a million jobs that's not helpful for us to cancel and order like that that are far more Sam\nOn Capitol Hill however lawmakers from both parties were sharply skeptical of the Saudis story and German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanded further clarity saying still nothing has been cleared up\nTurkish investigators have interviewed constantly are employees and Turkish media report the staff provided information that further calls into question the Saudi explanation staff members said they were told to take two days off\nIncluding October second the data showed you enter the consulate to collect paperwork so he could marry his Turkish fiance the Saudis have sacked five officials including a key advisor to the crown prince and the top intelligence officer Eighteen people were arrested in connection with ... death\nNone of those people are reported to be members of the Saudi royal family\nPeter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nDespite last night's revelations there are still many many questions about this whole episode including what possible goal the Saudis could have had and Turkey's role and all of this turkey has been a key source of both leaked in public information but as our

considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin\nIn recent years the public has gotten more and more concerned about deaths the citizens particularly unarmed citizens during police encounters in a few minutes we're going to hear from attacks us lawmaker who's trying to address this by requiring that high school students take instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop\nBut first you want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy\nOn October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office she needed a Kobe was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times this er Kobe later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Kobe is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss can be so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it has been shown that police officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet\nW UCI sustaining members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org [noise]\n... you know to do that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds of those those those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were to rabbits someone wouldn't you describe those things you might\nNot so for example Gino how tall Dylann Roof is do you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as deeply as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nMm [noise] it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police\nTo to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well absolutely and I think\nHere you see the impact of intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and Kevin between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person has a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where ... privilege in power into effect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issues of poverty that aren't as connected to issues of mental health in certain areas and connected to it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with the port and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who um shouted on rooftops has a story they needed to be told\nThe sister of genetic do uh Kobe who died earlier this month after being taste by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us in our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct towards civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course apple assigned is is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black but\nAccording to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that's just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nRead you know I don't like\n\nWhy are you\nKnow we all have earnings\nRice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us\nMy pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we're having over ... edition of African Americans and Latinos that it up and volatile confrontations with law enforcement or traffic stops and I guess ... it was kind of tipping iceberg for me\nIt's still end up ... steel he's an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nAnd I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to\nAt least to fire the baby right traditions of citizens and police officers ship what's lost here is that people are getting the legislation just focus on citizens will it doesn't it doesn't just focus on video\nA video camera set stage for additional course content for both citizen and also pollution police academies what\nWill be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the\nLength of course is a minimum of two hours the video was just a part of it's sort of uh\nAt least the video aimed at the students the ticks to appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nAh let me just say this the purpose\nOf the video is as a primer you know if we need to go back and makes it makes it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we define behavior expectations of police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in the ...\nOr what I mean why is that irrelevant when this very issue that used to spark your concern here is an African American man and I can encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of tension why would you know the little little\nThey were ... let me ask this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that uh do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but\nThe objective was to find a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put the behavior expectations are citizens and make certain citizens know what their rights are I've thought put it in schools and making the mandatory\nWas a great place to put it also also driver's license courses and also the police department of police academies and by doing that you have a great deal of

E. L. dot com\nAnd from the listeners to support this NPR station\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin\nWe want to turn now to the conservative effort to remake the federal courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federalist society Israel and doing that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC this week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges in exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secret and sign something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us is going to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\n[noise] so the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative\nDirection but you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this raised ethical concerns what were the concerns\nSeminar there may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar but there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and don't get a quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that a bit like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts are kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties ought to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat is a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThat yeah that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo there are all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities and sororities they all kind of create\nPipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at that they've been particularly intentional at this\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who condemned be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal so they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step\nInto the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably fine but also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is\nNot for it and what does heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on on line Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey have been very close melts about it I tried them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who was paying for it you know their materials say the generous donors were make news significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who the donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February the just issued a brief bland statement saying they were reevaluating\n... which suggests that perhaps they may try to reconstituted in a different form it's entirely possible years that's tacky covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be her\nFinally today we're going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds today we want to talk about how Hollywood is putting the opioid crisis front and center in one of the networks plus the shows and let me just say that we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day I cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne ... this week that you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular nineties show\nAfter star Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the Connors which married this week and ... we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just I'd be pro [noise] it's got to be wrong\nWe when I could talk about so we called Sam ... he's the author of dreamland the true tale of America's opioid opiate epidemic and he's joining us from Los Angeles via Skype Sam thanks so much for joining us pleasure to be here myself I get also joining us from NPR West in Culver City California is Jeff Yang he's a CNN cuts\nJeff welcome back to you as well always welcome to be back and we're going to start with you because critics had very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoided some of the kind of tough social commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you say\nYou know it's really interesting because anytime a sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black can and dark and\nA looming in a lot of ways in our society there's a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances\nOr that provide the inside right and in this case one of the things that was really strange to me is that one of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of\nRacist tweet that got her fired was that she was on Ambien at the time that\nThat you know medication and essentially led to this behavioral change so there is a weird tension in some ways",
