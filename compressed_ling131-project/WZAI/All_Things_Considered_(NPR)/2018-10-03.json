Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint\nThat changed completely last night when President Trump mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years\nToday the White House briefing room secretary Sarah Sanders\nNPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello so as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nI vote or just the motors version though as a woman\nNow he seemed to be sort of ... to the line that congressional Republicans seem to be hearing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but\nA lot of them use that key word credible then last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really divergent from that line and he was playing it to last and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today\nSome how the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her votes now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote\nYou know one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nAnd one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise lasted shared\nGo to Cape and islands dot

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro many people in the U.S auto industry are breathing a sigh of relief this week the new trade deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada and months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd will soon as senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies that make auto parts you're in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well entered after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend\nWe're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries can have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum\nA so all of that will impact our members and in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have cell or there's some new tariffs\nWho minimum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before the final ISIS agreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be tariffs for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of construct your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have the mind as they have been up to clear burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent so this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA\nAnd be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement just is it worse well\nI think for the United states perspective one of the things the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more Fillmore aluminum that's from North America and our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have the the administrators cost and we're gonna have to work really hard with all three parties to minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move forward that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of the motor on equipment Manufacturers Association thanks for speaking with us today\nThank you

from the landfill into neighbors' water wells\nCoakley shut down and became a Superfund site in the mid eighties it was covered with a cap to keep Iran from washing out more Thompson's\nFor years this put the public fears to rest then amid news of the cancer cluster and twenty sixteen workers made an alarming discovery high levels of pee fast chemicals and surface waters around the landfill\nSince then traces of these industrial toxins have also turned up in nearby wells\nOfficials are still working to pinpoint where the chemicals come from and they may never be sure what caused the cancer cluster but ... chemicals have been linked to a wide range of health effects including cancer so neighbors like Jillian lane are still terrified\nBy it and so were drinking the water and wear bathing and brush our teeth in it and we have no idea that we're living with this potential\nLanes family spent thousands of dollars on high tech water filters and she devoted countless hours to public meetings and petitions for more clean up and aid\nThe environmental protection agency says the peace us in nearby wells is not a threat based on state and federal standards but that doesn't quite line

S. said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general fine that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nAnd then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nVHS does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H.

considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro survivors of sexual assault are sharing their stories money for the first time Washington Post columnist Monica ... has been getting a steady stream of them in her inbox\nAnd her latest column has the headline deer dads your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you\nMany people have been sharing this column on line that I spoke with Monica has to be about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of survivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I have never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him this would make him cry the someone in did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learns that she had been a victim to\nOr I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world as a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of taboos in this area exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain ...\nI just think about tropes in sitcoms where the dad is sent to buy a pack of co tax for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that he can never make we do that with ... we do that with breast feeding\nOf these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on his spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on the spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women [noise]\nCan you tell us about some of the responses that you have to call them since it was published this week [noise]\nYeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yep please [noise]\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife for forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her and she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled\nI asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready I didn't answer but I'll do it soon\nNot today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi\nWell\nSo I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say I always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you own murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send\nBecause what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also but it's important for daughters to tell their fathers about the sort of have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time because of ...\nHearings because their fathers have said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you so if you were a father and you have a ... of how a victim should behave\nOr whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is\nWhy Monica ...

you just had the lawyers show up at his father's house I believe it was and put the piece of paper in front of him his father or somebody in the room realized right away this is not where we want to

couldn't come in and pillage Fred Trump's empire and the Donald we wouldn't have any more control or input over the state than any of his other siblings would\nThe White House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that [noise] well\nWe think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about another transaction Trump Palace and then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the trumps didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser\nGrossly undervalued some of the properties ... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining\nNew York times story you just heard about says the trumps were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do so\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax funding as usual is one thing to have a self serving valuations that are on the global side but it seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades has simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been now with only one in a hundred tax returns is now audited\nAnd Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue also to the extent the IRS has resources they are not going to be allocating ... tax enforcement\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat cares to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades [laughter] when it comes to a transactions allowing the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump's sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore the question is what regulators can do about it\nAnd why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue it\nAnd she would have limitations but severe as as the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on or turn means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS find evidence of wrongdoing severe as it can retroactively force Fred Trump's heirs to pay back taxes and they may have to pay civil fines as well Jim Zarroli NPR News New York

Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint that changed completely last night and the president\nAt a rally in Mississippi how did you get home I don't remember how did you go or don't remember where is the place I don't remember\nWhat I don't want to but I don't know and they in the White House briefing room press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nI vote or just the motor users are usually the first woman\nNow he seemed to be sort of hewing to the line that congressional Republicans seemed to be healing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really the verging from that line and he was playing it to laugh and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today\nSome of the response in in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her votes now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote\nYou know one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nAnd one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quotes\nI mean he's got that conversation with Jamie

breathing a sigh of relief this week the new trade deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada and months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd will soon as senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies that make auto parts you were in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well entered after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts in all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend\nWe're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required for parts to travel through the three countries going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement that traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more north\nUh so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have so are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before the final ISIS agreement and the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry and knock on away\nNo they haven't I think one of the things we have the mind as ... particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent so this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA\nAnd be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA is an improvement is worse well\nI think for the United states perspective one of the things the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral looming them that's from North America and our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have to see a ministry of cost and we're gonna have to work really hard with all three parties to minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge as we move forward that Graham it\nAnd we'll send a senior vice president of the mode on equipment Manufacturers Association thanks for speaking with us today\nAnd he was a pleasure\n[noise]\nCommunities across the country are
