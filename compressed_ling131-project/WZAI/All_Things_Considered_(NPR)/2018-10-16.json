thank you for joining us thank you and Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of New Hampshire state Senate\nThanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae to people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that as we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run a meal you'd you know what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu and I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices aren't are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae to be the woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has ...\nOr call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play mind games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time\nMontanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our\nPrimary ballots that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities um and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou get the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia ... twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades and the way it relates to algae to Q. people do think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that it got you know some wonderful fellow than in turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan\nPave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my age um [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana and just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting those the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nWell back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community step stuff and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people\nAnd we have all the overall national landscape for future LTV tiki candidates as well do you not\nYet I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think\nA lesbian that could do how could do what we've done\nA but it goes back to exactly what it merely a discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email us ...\nOne fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having a young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well\nTo those young people that are falling behind us [noise] I Want to thank all three\nOf you for joining us

Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's prisons here's this sound\nWe associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy steel doors shot [noise]\nThese are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women but once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it there are no more heavy steel doors for the women and that's not a somebody here [noise]\nBecause this prison is new and it's different inside the razor wire this place looks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from Don and tell them to ask depending on what level there and that's the warden showed dom showing us around and do what we do that in the community of right now [noise] part or outside and our yard and within ... and I guess it's still\nA prison the war is the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places\nIn some ways women's prisons are specially harsh because across the country women get disciplined at higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules they're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR and middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infractions ... big consequences women\nThe solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges that matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger this prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but\nIt's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today they could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had to ... I have one\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to men of other Iowa prisons where three times more likely to get punished for the ... being disruptive now\nDon toes were corrections officers to give out fewer tickets like for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform it was written for men's prison were assured inside out her sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just\nWant to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nDominance putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison every corrections officers being trained that women take different past the person they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing the rules especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance last\nOn the mental health ward Stacey runner is in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a slate gray coat\nWonders an inmate she came to this prison twenty two years ago\nIt was really hard not to get in trouble back then you had to be careful of everything you did it felt like everything was [noise]\nIt's just meant to be punished once\nShe was sick and statement or sell through breakfast another prisoner brought a banana from the dining hall and put a fire pillow so's asleep when this crime happened [laughter]\n... got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item [noise] yeah that was pretty rough\nBe a violation today but back then ... says she lost good combat credits\nGood behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary Collender a serving time per second degree murder now she says the changing the way women are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nAnd trying to contribute as much they institution so I mean I saw a shame [noise] you know and it helped me with my own my own shame in my own regret\nThe psychiatric unit in the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a garden and lots of natural light\nThere are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now Dr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so they're forced to live here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa was presidents several years ago he quit a psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years and my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that has been chain for months at a time in the basement\nSold his property\nVictims is to panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison that long histories of being victims of violence too\nBut research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence so one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now\nWomen can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show donned the warden\nMainly the correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe Warren has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought for which some concerns and what she said is you know ordinary people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there's one at it and Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we\nCash problems dom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down [noise]\nAnd it's the one other place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago there are four parts of cells a guard would watch separated from a station above when women with mental illness lived here they would often yellow into the night\nThis is what prison cells to do across the country you really look like for women or men\nYou dehumanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room that\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nBack it's back to white giving up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions often lead the ending up in the cell block like this one Joseph Shapiro NPR News\nLaura how women running he presents are making a difference in the way they are rough you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nI'm tied to the point coming up tomorrow the psychology of micro aggressions micro aggression refers to a subtle slight or snub directed towards historically stigmatized individuals' especially minorities\nAn example an Asian American born and raised in the United states has complimented for speaking good English although these communications typically appear harmless to observers they're considered a form of covert racism everyday discrimination we talk about questions to ask ourselves and why we shouldn't even within\nWill have to wait and see whether the crown princes repressive tendencies are even worse than what people were fearing\nThank you Jacki thanks very NPR's Jackie Northam\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has developed a close relationship with Jared Kushner President Trump's close adviser and son in law during ... time at the White House that relationship now faces more scrutiny after ... disappearance\nNPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe is here to tell us more about Cushing has role in shaping U.S foreign policy including port Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with my ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person uh since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties\nAnd there I was obviously and both both in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to Canada or Mexico first\nAh and cushion he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nTo Saudi Arabia and beyond many\nLeaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to be the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that\nContinued as president and so a big part of criminals portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east it coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about Christmas rolling working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared Nevada there is such a genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... about Trump\nOr but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and for secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with ...\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion or was one of the White House official who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin so I'm On a after could show gee went missing Mitt went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent\nUh but right now the crown prince has denied any knowledge of this disappearance or one of the criticisms of cushion there has been from an experienced him diplomats\nIs that because he lacks experience that it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of\nGlobal engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that cushion or could act as a back channel ah to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go\nThen there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family trauma and the Saudis\nAnd a lot of that is not clear because we don't have\nA President Trump's tax returns and some of that's not clear at some of these dealings are are not transparent but we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports\nAre that Kushner a cushion or a backed or associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a lot thank you you're listening to all things considered\n\nGood afternoon it's five forty four time now for a new book Robert finch has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and he's taking some time off this week we hear from them talking writer and historian Mary Bergman who talks about a fall visit to beach point intro\nI Can't help it I always bring the car to a crawl and I drive down shore wrote in North true\nSomething about all those cottage colonies all those motels scene of hundreds of thousands of summer vacations\nCompels me to drive a little slower I Want to look in every window a couple of weeks ago I spent a week and beach point that narrow stretch of land between province town intro this time I was without a car exploring the neighborhood on foot\nIt was early October and most everyone else around me seemed to be there for the fishing\nI stayed at one of the identical days cottages now no longer rented by the day's family but by individual owners from the outside the cottages appear unchanged each clad in white vinyl siding and see from green shatters\nTheir flower names the only way to distinguish one from the other the fishermen are up early in the morning before the sun rises which isn't hard to do these days\nThere are many morning hours spent in the deep blue black of pre dawn the fisherman lean on the bumpers of their trucks drink huge mugs of coffee and fill their coolers with ice at night they returned to their cottages and clean fish and the cement steps\nThe sound of the radio and the waves overlapping headlights trained on the fish I spend most of my time out there walking out on the old fire wrote into the dunes or long spindly causeway into province town\nUntangle or problem or get lost in the rhythm of my footsteps of the ways the cars on the road I don't know if you've turned on the news lately\nThat I walked nearly sixty miles that week feels good to move so much this time of year there's hardly anyone in the dunes on a weekday morning my foot prints are the only ones in the tire tracks left by the June tours\nAnd even the June shack dwellers are spending this foggy morning inside probably sleeping sand in the distance I see a colorful group gathered in the dunes at first\nThere are so far away I Can't quite tell their people or if they are the ... to mark the path from the ... or up to the ... they're getting closer larger it's a group of about twenty or more children out on a field trip that you didn't expect to see us out here today one of the teacher says\nGirl proudly holds up a plastic container of cranberries and her classmates take turns popping the tarp varies into their mouth\nThey walk in each other's footsteps trying not to disturb the landscape there were seven kids in my class when I went to school out here now I say I wasn't expecting to see so many of you\nBut it couldn't be happier all the kids are out here on a brilliant fall day it reminds me of all the October days my mother picked me up from school\nFor cranberry picking adventure of our own I'm back at each point and the sun is slipping away a little orange outdoor lights are just coming on at the cottages\nEverything is a Washington orange glow sort of folk sunset a car passes occasionally and the buses lurch along they all slow down when they passed daisy flocks pie any rose lilac\nBluebell cosmos Dalia and on and on and and who knew there were so many flowers a couple of would come back plates parks their car in front of the cottages and start taking pictures of the clothes line my bathing suit and towels snapping and the increasing when\nI look

of them\nA million Marquez is a Democrat in Montana she is running for the state legislature and the buildings area\nAnd she would be the first openly transgender person ever elected in Montana welcome Amelia Hi Gina Ortiz Jones is a Democrat in Texas running for Congress in the twenty third district which has the largest stretch of U.S Mexico border she could be the first openly gay woman\nEver elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you\nAnd Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of the New Hampshire state Senate thanks for being with us pleasure to be here [laughter] well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of ... to people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that as we get broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run a million ... what do you\nThink yeah this is Gina I think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu and I\nWhat happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's it's hard for me to separate being an algae woman being a first generation American being a veteran and I think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name of ... it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um\nWe actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities um and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou get the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae to accuse people do think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that it got you know some wonderful fellows and and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan\nPave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my age and so um [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana and just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when HIV was really hitting the Reagan Administration there was a lot ...\nAnd it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and demeaned but when you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nTerm process the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um\nThey don't necessarily feel good when someone of the LDP T. Q. community steps up and wants to run for office kind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people\nAnd we have all the overall national landscape for future algae BP keeps candidates as well do you know\nI mean I can tell you a you won't believe that I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think\nA lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it mealy discuss which is um you know what can you do for the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got\nAnd none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they will with so it at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYeah one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure Gina and Amelia do as well\nTo those young people that are falling behind us [noise] I Want to thank\nAll three of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and the million Marquez is running for state legislature in Montana it was great talking with all of you pleasure pleasure to speak with all of us [noise]\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News support comes from you and from the villages through what place and self Yarmuth independent living in a neighborhood setting country store and coffee shop fitness center with personal trainers and privileges said blue raw golf club the village at third place", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Brewster", "day": "16"}
