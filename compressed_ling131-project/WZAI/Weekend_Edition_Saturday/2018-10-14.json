Navarro\nThe midterms are less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate the house and many will also choose governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the G O P is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break 'em down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors\nThey haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats\nAnd this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be a sense is that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and\nThey want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it it's a good sign for Democrats this math is really for them\nWhat states are you watching heading into this last month the campaign I mean where they're really tight races\nSo there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida's always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African\nAmerican mayor from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santas it's going to be I think are really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state that is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising\nThe sun belt um Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but the Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma\nWhy is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding and you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat\nOn the state level but not on a federal level and Republican or some polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally he only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and\nTariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising and notable for Republicans as how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont still Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much\nThank you abolish\nIce has been a rallying cry for some on the left the coal gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who

Navarro\nUtility crews are working to restore power to customers from the Florida Panhandle to Virginia in the aftermath of hurricane Michael officials are warning it could take weeks in some areas\nAs we see more and more powerful storms hitting us it has many thinking about how to make the nation's power grid more resilient NPR's Jeff Brady reports\nIn Panama City Florida right now this is a common sense\n[noise] people who were lucky to have them or using gas powered generator utility crews to fix all of a down holes and wires and restored their electricity bay county emergency services chief\nMark Bowe and says that will be a long slog\nThis electrical system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the ears on the ground there\nAcross the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is extensive says got Aaron Senate the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to do respiration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody solution and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bowl\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills about one in ten\nBut fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing\nThat damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce alliance underground it can actually be much more cost me take like right now to ... to ... and an overhead wire\nMcNamara says in flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure she says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grids more resilient one thing McNamara\nWould like to see more of is independent micro grids with solar power and batteries at places like water treatment plants hospitals and facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nAnd we all need to be ... restraint chain of ensuring that critical infrastructure vulnerable population it keep the light I even brought her staff\nMcNamara was lead author of twenty Fifteen report that called for more renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases from power plants and address climate change that's a longer term view of how to make the grid more resilient but that report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost also fuel industries\nJeff Brady NPR News\nMichael hit the panhandle just as the voter registration deadline for next month's elections closed in Florida\nWe know Florida has a big presidential prize it's also hosted a bunch of closely watched political races this mid term season market pseudo covers Florida politics for political and he joins us now on the line thanks for being with us driving me\nAll right so first off you grow up in Key West you're a native Floridian and a Key West injured or might just over a year ago\nYou've seen a lot of storms comes through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction that's caused\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of Cleveland, Mississippi looked a lot like Mexico beach looks now if there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs\nAnd and all of the associated\nDestructive miss that kind of turns a once conflicts\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation and construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat and ... ... is running for governor against Monsanto is a former congressman who also has a lot of support in pockets of Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it couldn't name and what is the likeliest scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty seven team here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally\nRisk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over well both physically in these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee the mayor\nBut it was hit pretty hard\nIt was hit yeah a ...\nTallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as a Mexico beach right\nIn the uh the the county ... county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last and coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent run the census for his leadership during a storm hurricane her mean\nThis time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seeing a visibly\nIn in one case actually chainsaw in trees away [laughter] and\nMoving debris really so he's changed on your trees\nPerceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone to capitalize on the on the media moment and and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess it remains to be seen a what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nShort we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire panhandle meals possible right now because you can't get a hold of you know in a sense of the
