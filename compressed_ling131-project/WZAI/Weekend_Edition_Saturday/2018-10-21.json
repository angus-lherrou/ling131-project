milestone in Afghanistan they were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty feet I'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years and the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul\nI have to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is a reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us going to be here live so were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence\nKeep them away you know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote certainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that\nRight now we really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul\nThe suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by a policeman he detonated his explosive vests outside\nOr in the north there was shelling and couldn't do we know that they burned down one polling center outside a bit of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of cobble abroad his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent\nOther people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections the Afghan governance announced its arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around as the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province uh but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that\nHas held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things and just\nIt is forty seven degrees outside it was whole studio\nIs mornings rain can be short lived it will be overcast in the afternoon

Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire since\nA Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy pressure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many of them issuing statements supporting a boat or Saudi Arabia and ah and king so and\nOf course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of a lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents [noise]\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion on may in fact to be threatened now a there is a real great too I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they looked like the hero and the story a ironically they have you\nKnow forty thousand people in prison and many of them are\nAre journalists as well and activists than others so there clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically defending or you know uh this one ... and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nUh from the Saudis which has yet to be determined ugly\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an pending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that\nUh they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange the native investment they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't\nBe provided by other allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the IMF are a lot of very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with ... with liquidity\nI and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult [noise] uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more better thing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much thank you\nOn September twenty six twenty fourteen students from the teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of ...\nAlthough there remains have never been found the deaths were very sleep blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath and Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't done this has published and exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version\nThey Mexican Government said that the army and then at least they didn't know anything about what the what is happening and they just get not these two or three hours after everything\nI have seen all these years four years of investigation is that all the official\nThey're showing you sound like it's not it's a lie so tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise] what I discovered\nWas that the army and the ... not just where not these about why the west happening that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just these\nEven more I had reports all the shorter reports that proves that the army and if it up well he's way chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the I was before that\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how would the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move that two bosses where they were dressed birth dating inside to the CD\n[noise] to be able to take the more buses mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to that brought this to Mexico City so they went to both the station\nThey do do that you both us and when the students were trying to escape ... be ... by buses ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staple east is that to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they the opposite Dave of that back way to process\nIt from these two buses disappeared all day for a three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students on this bus has disappeared why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling in spy bus is quite that\nI'm not so nice to versus what exactly that to process that the army and they said that belief is stuck to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses would that do versus what the students were traveling from the school to why why so what I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nOr a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to me as a harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know\nThe students do they know for the army and if the police they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know it does west that are really tragic accident they didn't know\nHow you know that heroin was hitting on that bus [noise]\nI was able to connect with one drug lord in both on drug lord

G.\nFrom listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nThis weekend edition from NPR News under the Garcia Navarro\nThe deadline for an orderly withdrawal of the United kingdom from the European Union is looming and literally marching into the scene this weekend hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of London demanding a new Brexit referendum and another say on the matter Charlotte Gallagher is in London and she joins us now she's a reporter for the BBC the morning\nMoaning uh so tell me about this demonstration and put it into some context was this a surprising turn out for a ...\nAnd say the organizers said I was about seven hundred thousand people that and the ... confirmed the numbers but sets and they had hundreds of thousands of people that and that was well above what the ... on the police and I think the media than south expected\nAnd so a huge turnout from people right across ... she's coming down from Scotland people flying in from Northern Ireland coming in from Wales and even people from your effort to from Germany France and eight today that traveled to London for a much that you know some of the city's nice famous street\nPeople marching past that we found as like in ... that\nBrexit stole my future people wrapped up in eve flags kind of children in ... with ease flags face paint on and it's kind of very precious thing for people like ...\nUm I Love dogs with that kind of dressed up in your outfits we heard it on the radio and I I'm not the dog didn't look happy about that a lot of ... and it's a real of a lot of young people\nOn the small city they're specially people that couldn't vote in the last referendum if they were too young and they were the ones saying that ...\nAnd that basically which is severely affecting ... so a lot of them are really pushing for this people buy on any kind of ... I'm a great\nWell ... is another referendum even possible I mean we have these very chaotic negotiations um the prime minister they're really struggling to hammer out a deal um is a vote possible\n[noise] so ... if possible we could have\n... the prime minister ... and I have said that is not going to be another ...\nBut that could be one technically however\nIt would take months and months to find a second to get all that I just ... in place and I have had a beginning what ever sneak you to leave in March they probably if that was going to be some kind of people that it would have to do that and\nThat the day in March would have to be put back for the British Government would have to agree to that and all the other countries in the ... say twenty seven other countries\nWould have to agree to during that so it's a it's a big asking this amount of time reading\nThat's the b._b._c. Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and purely local concerns and that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule\nI'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats\nAnd that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket it's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates\nDon't have the millions of dollars to run\nThat say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nMight have so they're just gonna maybe both just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats in any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states that are really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nPurely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation will reverse what Republicans the hammering the same issue\nYeah I I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip and one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house but if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats\nEven in the state that soon as much trouble is Connecticut\nBecause again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about uh how a democratic tax increases have traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty senses that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of the states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships\nThere'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks are going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nWe'd Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you forty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard Nixon's Saturday Night massacre President Nixon had up ended the Justice Department having let go of his attorney

Democrats saying they have no idea who would want to file\nWe learn soon after that the burglars had ties to the Nixon reelection campaign and an even larger story began to trickle out thanks to to Washington Post reporters who pursued it when few others were paying much attention Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein Nixon was re elected in a landslide that November but\nIn the early months of his

what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival over his long used\n\n\nSelf hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nWhat your name is Raphael you know you go by cared that's an angle sized version of it he was the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA tests\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized is that we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identifying for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we can over your identity we can bring identities and when they don't do much good\nWere inclined to suppose that they do more work than they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other so that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best\nStill matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em too seriously and in many political context I'm\nThe most important thing in that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions\nAnd it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the kind of the best feeling on the grounds so you have to balance it out\nIs the role of identity politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collecting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly carefully [laughter] I I think you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way\nAnd that leads down the terrible road because once you've created as a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the ... century they're drawing people together a through making them feel ashamed of hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind\nIt makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm hearing a a real concern that identity and and the politics around it it has been weaponized and it certainly\nI think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is is that we're more divided around identities than we are around policies so that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come to reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things\nWe're from sensible middle ground but it's not available to us because the people who are most in ... I think that every concert from smoke coming together but losing losing to the other side\nBut in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nYeah by the question is whether you could do that with our board you go Rodney recognizing identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies\nDemocracy needs crafting for compromise and turning everything into an identity is who makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lies that bind rethinking identity thank you very much for your room of America's\nTest Kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they test tools techniques and recipes before making recommendations on a TV show in magazines and cookbooks now for the first time America's Test kitchen is taking that know how to to use\nIn the complete cookbook for young chef NPR's Lynn Neary recently visited a young chef as she tried out a recipe with some help from an expert\nEight year old Lucy Gray is wide eyed and vibrating with anticipation when her dad Paul opens the door to greet me and Mali burned bone editor in chief\nOf the night she so good to me to Lewis I\nLose he likes to cook and has helped make some meals for her family but this is the first time she will cook something by herself\nThe cookbook has more than one hundred recipes and Lucy has chosen to make one pop pasta with quick tomato sauce we begin assembling everything we need olive oil crushed tomatoes in a and she takes up basal Lucy decides to taste it\nGoes literally the day so [laughter] at one point\nWhile reading the recipe Lucy stumbles over an abbreviation she doesn't quite understand\nCalls this is why he\nToo that's at that says T SP which was the abbreviation for peace and this is one capital T. that's at the house and let me ask you something in line at the beginning of the book\nKitchen yes recall it decoding kitchen big there's so many words in these recipes that you just don't know until you've cooked a lot so it is a lot about understanding the foreign language that comes with cooking\nThe cookbook lays out the basics with everything from photographs of tools and equipment to instructions on how to measure men's and chop this recipe calls for a chopped onion the first and has to repeal\n[noise] system [noise] like let's say\nThe cookbook emphasizes safety in the kitchen was burned down demonstrates went shopping Dionne yeah it can be hard to make\nThis first touch so yeah you see how my fingers are like this all ... and that means that my fingers are never going to get accidentally on the night so this is the safe way to hold and I had a anything\nPrep were finished it's time to cook beginning with those chopped onions", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "city": "Brewster", "day": "21"}
