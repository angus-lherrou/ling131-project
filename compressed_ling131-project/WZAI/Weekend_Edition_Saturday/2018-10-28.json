are feeling frankly scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and takes though\nAre we getting it getting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric thing also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nOr we'll Schachter teaches sociology

we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from the precipice turning the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at that precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peas position on health care [noise]\nDefinitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the

according to a new poll by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health now one county in western Washington is taking a unique approach to tackle the problem\nAnd a boy co why rocket why rock of finding fixes podcast reports how that works\nBack when ... was the police chief stand would Washington population seven thousand people he thought rural communities like his were immune from the opioid crisis until one day a mother walked through his door\nAnd basically said gee if you have a heroin problem in your community and I I remember thinking well it's not possible to stand with than heroin is in big cities you know was homeless population it's not in rural\nAmerica for decades heroin was a big city problem but no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened in the last five years now ... agrees a few years ago he was elected sheriff of ...\nAnd saw this very very sick very very sick people because you talk to and from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can be bought burned out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time around half the inmates were withdrawing from heroin it was a dangerous and expensive situation\nIt took becoming the sheriffs to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts in the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had we had to change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand with is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the opioid epidemic as if it were a natural disaster\nThe same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic snow how much county is the first county in the country to treat it this way [noise] the idea grew out of their experience with another tremendous disaster in the county [noise]\nIn twenty fourteen the town of Oso, Washington experienced one of the deadliest landslides in American history\nForty three people died Sherri ... is the

wing or over the top of that and all in coordination with each other all the same objective which is like sixty\nCoordination life safety what if they used that system of everyone working together across government agencies to tackle the opioid epidemic\nCounty leaders took the idea and ran with it now the response to the opioid epidemic is run out of a special emergency operations center\nA lot like during the Oso landslide every two weeks representative from across local government meet people in charge of everything from fire trucks to the dump\nThe technical name for this group is the multi agency coordination group or Mac group it come straight out of FEMA's emergency response flavor six times is completed may talk through PowerPoint slides I found my fire is kind of the numbers refer to items on there to do list there\nOpioid misuse and reduce damage to the community\nEach school is broken down into smaller pieces like distributing needle cleanup cats and a project to train schoolteachers to recognize trauma in addiction\nIs to do list is over one hundred items long some of these goals are really long term I mean they're going to take years decades ... is also the spokesperson for this group she says the key is to be realistic\nSo she sent an objective for yourself to just end the opioid epidemic you're probably never going to be successful in either in any of our lifetime [noise] um by breaking it down like eating an elephant you just can eat one piece at a time or can it down into a piece that you can actually digest\nThey make transportation easier for people in drug treatment they train family members and others in the community an steps to reduce overdoses with medicine and they actually send teams of police officers and social workers\nTo help addicted homeless people [noise]\nIn Marysville, Washington range rips through cedar forests next to a strip mall officer Mike you will cracks jokes with some legal campers [laughter]\nI agree with

next I'm Lois Lerner good morning it's just about nine AM\n\nThis weekend edition with special coverage from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro we're watching a press conference is about to start in Pittsburgh this morning eleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people are injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference alive when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning\nHi Lulu oh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well what we know is that eleven\nPeople were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as a day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime well it\nIs being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody out the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing\nAnd and what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities\nSay the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a it as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\n[noise] this into context for us so there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRight I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil like an eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying\nOne of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an active hate against one community is an act of hate against us all this mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in decades\nYeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning\nRight um I went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um\nAs far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a ... a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner\nAnd and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and\nUh people or you know grappling as they as they do and and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this compound\nJust before we go to that um how's the community responding\n[noise] yeah well as I mentioned there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened at a house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so that's just one small thing the communities doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and the people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n[laughter]\n\nYeah ... incredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nUm something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon addressed a shooting remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the Senate God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage\nWith the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there'd been mass shootings in recent years the gift tax is that the actively carry out that's at sentences but unless the president is is calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke lasts\nAnti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRight and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was a you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that when you walk\nAround Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it or what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well\nI think in these situations and and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for a crime so they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere's also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nI'm In this case there are as we said indications that suggest that\nUm the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant uh motives that tells us something about why this might have happened again that's still under investigation but um it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching spring's here waiting for a ... in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happens and also we like to know more about about the victims soon\nAnd we're going to bring in ... or Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara a good morning It's MORNING\nSo set the scene for us the president's response and and basically how oh we're actually starting this press conference and now I'm with\nA western Pennsylvania is blessed to have so many a law enforcement agencies that work together that train together\nUh and yesterday just showed how that works city county state federal agencies working together no egos working together for what's right and uh I Can't thank them enough for that uh and just uh\nAnd now we're going to continue on and show with Pittsburgh's made us so thank you [noise]\n\nMorning I'm a doctor car Williams of the medical examiner chief medical examiner of the Allegheny county and again I Want to reiterate what everybody said so far which is we\nIn my office extend our deepest symphonies and condolences to the families I met with them last night during the process of identification and there's no words to express a uh the the um the sympathy that they need it yesterday evening at the uh I'm a synagogue we um\nAre under the synagogue and ...

authorities are asking for your pleased to be respectful of uh the uh the needs of for the time and space as they deal with this tragedy uh today in the coming weeks they will need to know the Pittsburgh supports them as a lifting them up like you\n[noise]\n[noise] Hi I'm Jeff Finkelstein I'm the president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh um so I have to begin by saying that I've seen this room a lot of times on TV and I never thought I'd be at the podium um\nThis is an awful awful period for a Jewish community and uh and especially for the families who've been affected and it's real once once you hear the names were going to do everything we can to help the families were in the process of doing that now\nAnd will be there for them and be there to help our Jewish community and the Pittsburgh region or heal from this\nI Want to echo a lot of the things in gratitude that people have already expressed to local law enforcement up to the FBI\nUm to to ... an army the red cross of all been there with us yesterday at the Jaycee see I Want to thank my colleagues at the Jewish community center and Jewish family and children's services especially for really stepping in to work with a with the families um\nAnd um and you know we will we will definitely get a will get past this and be a strong Jewish community like we've always been\nThank you and then I asked the mayor to come up now\nExtra [noise]\nA strong town we are a resilient city we had been knocked down when we found ways to stand back off and we've always done it in one way or working

day of Pittsburgh history by working together squirrel hill is the most diverse neighborhood in all of western\nTo live there because of the diversity of the community the Jewish community is the backbone is part of the fabric of Pittsburgh and we will be there in all communities to support our friends in the Jewish community\nWe um [noise] as I said it had been knocked down before but we've always been able to stand back up because we work together and I have to take a moment to think those that spoke earlier\nThe effort that was put in across multi jurisdictions from the federal should the state to the county to the local\nWas something that we should all be proud of the fact that we were able to work together as one community suburban medics coming in voluntarily to take on different areas of our city because all of our medics were after seeing\nOur medics deciding on their day off to voluntarily come in to fill seven additional ambulances to back up our officers and the officers who came from surrounding counties the federal agents in this state troopers and the county officers all working together\nIn order to be able to make sure an episode\nThat will forever go down in the history of this city is one of the worst moments that we have experienced\nWas able to be less than because of that coordination into those that are standing behind me who spoke early earlier the professionalism that was exemplified through their leadership\nWas something that we needed it our darkest time [noise] to our officers who are in the hospital into one officer who's been discharged the thanks of an entire city go to them\nThey're sacrificing their knowing of the danger that they put themselves in in order to be able to protect others there's something when they put on that uniformed that we should understand\nThe sacrifice that they make them to their family members the city will be behind in there to support you in anything that you may need\nAnd finally to those that are not familiar with Pittsburgh\nTo those who have given a their words of not only confidence but support soup Pittsburgh from around the world around this nation and around the state thank you we know\nPretty are better than this we know that hatred will never win out that those that tried to divide us because of the way that we pray or where our families are from around the world will lose in in Pittsburgh we're pragmatic\nAnd we find solutions to problems we will not try to rationalize irrational behavior we will not try to figure out ways in order to lessen the degree of crimes such as this we will work to eradicate it we will work to eradicate it from our city\nFrom our nation in our world\nHatred will not have a place anywhere\nAnd we will work locally to make those changes happen and we'll work with partners around this country and around the world to make sure that it adds\nTo think again all of those in this room the elected officials who were gathered those that have worked on the front line of public safety those that worked within public works in other parts of the government\nIn order to be able to assure the safety of our people and will open it up to questions at this time\nI was ... built into us You're listening to special coverage from NPR News and it was a press conference taking place in Pittsburgh relates to the deaths of eleven people

where there were a pair of brothers Cecil and David Rosenthal also a husband and wife in her eighties I Believe\nAnd the synagogue shooter and he has actually complained about that he said that\nHe

saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case he's or say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn now to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning mourning the [noise]\nAll right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's a perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources\nMake all these explosives and put the nation on edge um CNN has reported citing a source\nThat uh he apparently was making them in his man and there's no sign yet or any other help\nAre we getting a picture of how\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nWas about things like a soccer and body building in nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of of Fort Lauderdale in Parkland community that had been horrific school shooting this year\nIt's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I began making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nThe financier who's been in the news so much lately and in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you spoken with coworkers including one who was in that fat\nYet Deborah gradient was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWould start talking about the last Hitler\nWe should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre thank you so much\nThank you losing [noise]\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity and politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers race to the New York times magazine welcome to the program\nThank you for having me so\nWe often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nI mean typically when we talk about black voter though that Tina voters are any\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about\nEducated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engaged in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so\nI have treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about my people [noise] well\nI think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see why people as voting a in a racialized away because\nBy ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue and in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that they're they're white and it was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say white but are voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was ...\nOf sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journals are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color where you had legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not\nActually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is that most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend
