with us this morning as NPR's Deborah Amos has covered Saudi Arabia for years ... thanks so much for being with us the money you have seen the shouting statement\nWhat does it tell you about how the

that's gone terribly wrong the Saudis now admit that there is a standing order to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary\nBut the account lays the blame on the senior security officials who went beyond the order they killed this dissident journalist they covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership fail to confirm his death earlier\nBad news travels slowly to the top is that one Saturday defender put it on Twitter these latest accounts distance the top leadership and especially the powerful crown prince but there are so many questions left to be answered\nOne of the biggest right in front of us whereas Mr ...\nIndeed so the Saudi account says that his body was handed over to a local Turk for disposal\nTurkish authorities I have been just continuing this

response so far the death of dramatic who showed gee we turn now to ... he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council on global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is\nThe empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership that Rebecca thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience to Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham you died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi or explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh on how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nWashington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council\nSecondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that week\nOf leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid unborn society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries on to a point of a value and that is not the most effective way to do it\nBut there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet\nThis administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed and in Turkey that Mr Putin's denial of it now\nElection interference in our own elections uh and uh then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident of the leader of the three world will be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a if not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy\nAnd that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen coffee weeks is unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nSo during the for profit is a new you probably remember Hector mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War but American mercenaries working for foreign powers that something that ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news joined U.S interests\nThank you wire us\nRetired special forces which is what you're talking about in your investigation and such a demand\nFor the last Seventeen years seals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have excelled\nAt this modern style of warfare at uh the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that to the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges\nBarracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people\nAnd we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is mhm\nThey sure investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries I see no there's not many other names for them or the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden and twenty fifty\nThese special forces a unsealed veterans Navy SEAL veterans' day deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the eight and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen soon as long as the party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political leader the\nLA and Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should gift in this story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was reservists and he was a seal reservists he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had a ... a top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know [noise]\nI guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal the Jewish citizens couldn't do that there are laws that do govern whether the U.S when the U.S\nAnd I listened foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions are you seeing how Americans have served in the French or ... I mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces and these are numbers on lots of\nA lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... sure\nRight yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign knows where he just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is ... ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\nRight is this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or oh they're the only ones

just about any face an obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week\nIt included a photo of a smiling face of metal to Lynch in there with her toddler son Hayden was grinning from its perch on her back\nThat photo showed a good day for money but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old when production ... high school party\nA drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal and limbs and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age\nHer sister Kato needles wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and starring Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs and it was this real sees our we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe had a long time to run it through our minds\nOr she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we're all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share ... addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ...\nTo people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry out for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or buprenorphine there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based painkiller\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver there aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also ...\nBarrier to recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service for Maddie on Sunday there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWhile through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a\nA video of Matty singing a bonding rate songs he's just sitting at the kitchen table is will they share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now\nAnd I think we'll have more is that kind of sharing on Sunday\nWhat Bonnie rich on there [noise] I Can't make you left me\nIndeed I don't know\nKato Neal wrote about her sister Maddy Lynch in there and the Vermont we be seven days thank

executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's

turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step but it's a big said it's a lot of people a lot of people involved that I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people crunch referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight to the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nHe he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called the shows used at the unacceptable but also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWhereas a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution a cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand just\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact checks as the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting uh give given how quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like eh not so with the Saudis now\nAll of this comes up its president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talked about how does he present his argument at his rallies\nHe is really trying to get the a C is hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh you now calls Democrats who protested Kammen Kavanaugh in unhinged\nAngry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nUh and and he talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of a ... to ...\nAnd here's John ... thanks very much for being with us thank yous got\nWell President Trump says he wants more information before deciding how to respond to the Saudi explanation of ... death\nSome members of the U.S Congress has called for sanctions on Saudi Arabia the Trump Administration has appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nTook the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft\nAnd throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space\nThis week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on its face at least a friendly visit to Riyadh for talks with both the king and crown prince Pompeo told reporters on his return to the U. S. the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nWe have long rigid relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n... is right about that for decades us presidents from both parties have felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly enlisted men dressed as the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nTrump has no artifice about him so he's quite up front about this sort of transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed or have to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military [noise] those are the biggest orders in the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states the kingdom is pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like ... and loose should motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard in Georgetown and foreign policy think tanks here in Washington\nEven before the Saudis acknowledged ... death some recipients were trying to distance themselves from the kingdom's money but it's not easy says Rachel Bronson author of the book sicker than oil America's uneasy partnership with Saudi Arabia\nThey invest in long term goals they invest in real estate they've been lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions and art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both us and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on that front is mixed former President Obama took a step back from the Saudis as part of his diplomatic overture to Iran but Brunson says Trump has embraced the kingdom more tightly than ever\nTournament station has put us\nAnd they've been very very public about that\nTrump has sided with Saudi Arabia and its regional fight with cutter and encourage the very public romance between his son in law Jared Kushner and the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Selma as the president said yesterday before the Saudis acknowledged ... death that makes it tough for Trump to crack down now\nSay maybe as many as ... as well this is so\nSad but ... says Saudi Arabia was all ready backsliding on its pledges of modernization which is part of what made ... so critical\nWhich I'm On the show he represented for many of us was this belief in managed change in Saudi Arabia which is very slow he could be patient he he expected to the patient but when he didn't expect with their reversal that he was seeing like hunted in from on\nTrump says he will listen to congressional calls for sanctions against the Saudis and that he wants to work with lawmakers even as the president's stresses he wants to preserve those multi billion dollar arm sales Scott Horsley

I mean there last year because of your\nYour cubs took them out in a fantastic battle but I can tell you that this is what you're supposed to do when you come close and then you have a chance this year you've got a game seven you haven't been to the world series since Nineteen eighty two and of course the Dodgers have a chance to go to the world series back to back so this is what is better than\nWinner take all game seven National League championship series\nUm we wanted up this week course of the world series is set to open on Tuesday the NBA begins their season in Boston in Boston

course has already ...\nIs the NBA getting closer to hiring a head coach who happens to be a woman\nYeah I think it's coming in and I think it's overdue when they make I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another unnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the\nAnd the NBA has been the progressive league the NBA's been the one that has been better on on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having\nFemale referees the NBA's been better with my colleague doors work on the broadcast and so the next step is to have\nA female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in that we do here I Want to note yes [laughter] I Know and in in that sport it's a\nBig deal and in professional sports in the the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and Hannah Storm and Andrea Kramer\nBoth doing a broadcast as well and so it's it's important in these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA seems to be the one when it does

tie break the way that the way that they do after the U.S open after after the fifth that tie breaking I don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree\nI understand the reason why people do it why they can get to a big deal and I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is fix eleven or whatever we know they can sort of a hundred and forty five\nMiles an hour and that they it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys\nAnd so we never had this conversation with with when players were were six feet under\nSo my advice to those guys just break\nA ... hour thank here in San Francisco

understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors should mere\n[noise] yeah so\nWe knew that there was a really high possibility that three ... we would give this child HIV but the other thing we had to wait is that the child to being\nOn a waiting list for and live a diner for three times the average\nAnd this child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV what if the parents don't do\n[noise] so the parents were saying to us why ... nights where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day why\nWouldn't you consider us so they were sick need that to wish from the parents and the mom particularly who was the diner\nThat she could be a diner and we had to consider that very casually 'cause we have to make sure that we promote Senate Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible so it was

shine through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in normal life\nThen that shouldn't ... from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you for having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this\nThat that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "20"}
