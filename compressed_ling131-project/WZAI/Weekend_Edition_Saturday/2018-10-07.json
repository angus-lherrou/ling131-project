ahead Hi Nina Hi Lulu\nThis has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work\nLet me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this not per se\nOr and Alina Kagan we're at Princeton on friday and asked\nAbout the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important than for the court to guard isn't this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment\nThan we live at um this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court well\nI guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether\nThe employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers\nGay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin other places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been

by a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence how it\nYou know as if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because the story was all I knew and it was so\nImportant to all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions in a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told at the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that the my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate\nTreat you as was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were\nYou were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts

Peter Kenyon joins us from Istanbul now to sort through the story I'm good morning Hi Lulu it's a very confusing tale um talk us through what do we know\nWell we know democracy Yogi walked into the Saudi conflict Tuesday around one in the afternoon he needed some paperwork relating to a pending marriage to his Turkish fiance she waited for him outside holding his phone until well after the consulate closed as says he never came out\nA Turkish police opened an investigation and then came the surprising reports first by unnamed Turkish officials now on the record by an advisor to president rigid type air to one that investigators believe the show he was killed in the consulate are aired on says he's saddened that the journalist disappearance but not much more than that so\nFar and we haven't seen any evidence to back up this claim that show is dead just the persistent question if he's still alive where Izzie\n... what is the Saudis and saying\nWell the Saudis are basically denying everything except the fact that the show he did come into the constantly Tuesday Afternoon or the Saudi press agency quotes officials saying he left the consulate Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg News\nThey're very keen to know what happened to him a there is no evidence on the outside of whoever to show that show he actually did leave the consulate uh the consul general invited Reuters reporters in showed them around there was no sign of the show he said the consulate has multiple exits\nBut why would show the lead by another exit if he knew his fiance was waiting up front\nSo lots of questions this advisor to president air to one says he's convinced to plane loads of Saudis who arrived in this stumble on Tuesday the same day could show you went into the consulate were somehow involved he also says he doesn't believe the Saudi claims that there is no camera footage of the show ... either inside or leaving the constant\nAlright two questions in the
