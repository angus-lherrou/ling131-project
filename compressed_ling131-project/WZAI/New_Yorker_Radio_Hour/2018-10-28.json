[noise] afternoon at five one of the [noise]\nWe'll come back to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick the midterm elections are often said to be a referendum on the presidency and that's never been more true than this year in the era of Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there are also other issues on your mind as a voter local stuff\nThat is maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter Eliza Griswold has been spending a lot of time following races in the state of Pennsylvania\nAnd what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state the thing that's foremost on people's minds is a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes through a lot of people's backyards and they're really unhappy about it\nOne of the communities allies have visited was exton Pennsylvania in the suburbs of Philadelphia\nActually there's a place where two tectonic plates in American politics meat we thought Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about it's kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans and al ... who is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance to go Rob\nWere on a leafy suburb and straight their colonial houses which are made of brac inside and was final it's a middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is going door to door she's a suburban mom of two kids under the age of five\nRunning for office Danielle excuse orange ... you do okay well I actually live right on top and drive\nAnd I decided to run because for the last five years our neighbors here have been dealing with us\nWe she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fence thing that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Danielle to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on her Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party um there are\nOne two three four five six rows of pipes\nIt's within five fifty feet of my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and um we're standing right now ten feet from playground that my neighbors kids my kids play on\nYour greatest fears Danielle with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impacts heavier fears about it impact your life um [noise]\nIt's horrible to think about a couple of weeks ago I'm a pipeline exploded in ... county in Pennsylvania and it was a snow cone pipeline that was only a week old [noise] and so I actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare\nOf like my ... he's like burning in her bed [noise] and um [noise] I call them and I said we have to move like you have to move we can't [noise] um\nAnd like thankfully in beaver county there are only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless destroyed um those things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality\nSo [laughter] you know we're here trying to connect some of the dots between what's going on politically nationally as well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics\nIt's just an example of the egregious ness of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs\nAnd how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone let's put it this way I never in my life never in my life\nW sea ice is standing members helped make

district one fifty five is Becky carbon a Republican has been in office is two thousand twelve I reached representative carbon for an interview and she sent the following statement I have a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community\nThen she listed her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\nBut here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics in both the Republican legislature and the Democratic governor Tom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking is made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state\nIn America and and that's brought in a lot of different players including ... and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nThey are kept for high review of engineers environmental scientists wildlife biology and geology design or find find follow the safest wrong with the smallest environmental footprint\nATP is a private corporation that they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline the pipeline moves natural gas liquids from the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the eastern markets hook outside Philly where it shipped overseas\nWe were following the root of the pipeline through Pennsylvania our second stop was a hundred miles west of accident in the small town of ... blooms\nGun shop we met Ralph and Doris blue\nTheir shop as a small building in a modified garage on their property or shot guns are mixed up with things stun guns in the interests and its infested was quick\nSo they know Radcliffe showed up at my office shortly after town on a Monday morning along with Michael showman who writes about food or for the New York [noise]\n\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter] and he didn't

facts and we leave him alone\nBut to us the bigger the biggest thing that we work on is what I refer to as fact based opinion in other words like you have to know the underlying facts in order to correct they constructed argument I'm\nNot really a science more kind of an art it's kind of back into editing you make there are kind of having such judgments that you make and of course that's a
