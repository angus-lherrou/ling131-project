{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WZAI", "content": "Our thanks to you and all our members for the generous supportive your local NPR station\n[laughter] Mm [noise]\nYou're listening to Ninety point one double you ca I and double you ca I H. D. one Woods Hole Martha's Vineyard Ninety One point one W. N. A. N. Nantucket Ninety four point three WBAI Brewster and W. GBH H. D. three eighty nine point seven\nBoston on line at Cape and islands dot org serving the came the coast and the island and then\nSomeone in Manhattan or certainly covert action is a New Yorker and WNYC studio\nTo the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nWhen we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen\nHe was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn to more specific more accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on\nBut they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say this lightly an existential threat to American democracy\nBut what we've learned since twenty sixteen is if somebody really did want to hack the election it wouldn't be impossible not at all to help and has been writing for the New Yorker about election security and what she's found should scare us all\nSearch or in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time\nIn August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election he started poking around the Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems which ran all the elections in Georgia\nIn the course of doing that\nI did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... elections stuck in a salt dot edu Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website\nAnd generally that turns up reports or public presentations and this this particular search didn't turn that up\nInstead I found a very curious links and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or names in some sort of a dinner fire next to their name and I immediately thought wow that's that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and we found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor passwords to be used on election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I thought to myself while this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself would be a huge story but on top of that limb also found security hole to which you could download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birth date last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number\nAnd there were also gyms databases and the gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count\nIf Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bonanza that is the scariest scenario\nI could think of would be an attacker\nGraham's that are placed on the electronic books were altering the voter registration databases disenfranchised voters an attacker could of compromise the Web server and used it as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks\n[noise] this is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect us from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched\nThen more information started to trickle out the intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked\nAbout Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nLook we have no idea if the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know\nBut this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms a few months ago the director of national intelligence that the warning lights are blinking red\nSome states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that's their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts Susan green hall is the policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right um so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and\nPerhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a across the country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia\nAre computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely had machine that don't have a paper ballot and then there's also other machines which count paper about those are all the computers and those machines can be\nWithin them and that's why having the paper ballot is so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted correctly\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet and I wonder if you just explain\nWhy it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWell many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location\nWhether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet it has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer\nThat program here are the candidates here at the races here's how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the voting machine that's in the polling location\nBy some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing the programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that deep bunks that assertion which is that many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless modems to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and those cellular networks are part of the Internet\n[noise] [noise] we spend a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies but there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to do\nWith the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia that purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base [noise]\nThis has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um\nThe roles are they they endured Kennedy use electronic pull books\nAnd people were showing up and they were being told you are at the wrong polling location or you've already voted during early voting or you already voted absentee or your name is in here or your address has been changed the vendor\nGoing to miss the snow I'm going to miss the the um the things the grill [noise]\n[noise] I'm On the tree is\nGoing to miss the fun\nI'm miss the animals and I miss you ever want another well\nIn other words\nI Need to know the play\nIs\nWill there peas and he knows where this one nearly ... ... I'm going on in the ...\n\nThing and all this ... um ...\nBeen kissing me so long [noise] another word yeah\nAnother well\nAnother well\nYeah\nThat's the beauty of beauty isn't it ... do you ever say we're texting with a known about the songs that do you how much do you tease out what the song is about\nOh I didn't try I didn't need to I mean for me it for me it's mostly about climate change no\nBut you've you've been through a certain number of political moments sixties and and many moments in between ... and just how does this seem similar different [noise]\nUm it's just I couldn't have dreamed us up all the stuff I've been through and all the countries no dictatorships and you know um and do all that if somebody is hit said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could end\nIt's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil and it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero empathy so um it leaves you believe me thinking how am I gonna conduct my life\nIt's ... you know it's the year the bully and um to bully people now seems to be okay to lying ... no problem no perjury is not a problem um and so that that is a new normal\nAnd how has it changed the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning as yeah procedure today well I think\nI mean I've heard other people say this to law oftentimes as hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize that it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety [laughter]\nI'm anxious about the state of the world which is terrible and so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial [laughter] that's a good grade advised yeah\nAnd um don't expect much and keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary get forget which one it was\nBecause of this scene appears in so many documentaries of you singing at the march on Washington and I I I just wonder how you\nVisualize and you remind moments like that in your life which are now distant and their iconic in the minds of other people but you were you're there you're holding the guitar you are in a microphone and kind of lousy sound system and seen it was a half million people or whatever it was [noise]\nDo you think about these moments in your past and you know I think as I get\nOlder sometimes I Do or someone who show me a photograph\nI think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said um and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know it um in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah yeah\nYou you mean there's some there's some times a year in the middle of an event that turns out to be iconic and you have no idea\nI think festival a political moment yeah\nI'm I was just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last helicopter in and looking down and seeing these people are like and you know at least ... people and so I had a hint then of that this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my\nForever and in yours and mine yeah ... you know this next song that you're going to do I went to um Charleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these\nThese ... relatives of people who lost people in the church there in this in this slaughter and it it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed um that President Obama a when too it seems like a million years ago it does the idea of a\nOf a president I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that\nNot only is the crowd with him and he feels they feel like allies but he's able to sing the song and begin the song yeah that lift people up as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses hello [laughter] um yeah how do you remember that\nThat terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the so well\nCovering this song it was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them or in the future\nThat song just dropped out of the sky shouldn't by the way Milford I did not know and most people didn't know and [noise] I Need to tune that\nDidn't get to have you done [noise] I mean if I was a Quaker attuned only knocking that guitar you're killing I knock any are hearing it loudly\nAnd they just go ahead yeah okay Mm\nMm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm Mm\nYoung men came to our house of man they did not have brought him he was\nNot friend he was not keen but\nAnd they let him Maine\nAnd foreign our the strangers sees that he's that with them many seemed to me\nBut then a young man to God and ...\nYeah [noise]\n\n[noise]\nW UCI sustaining members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nAnd the cameras roll and the nation and\nOne could say what must be said for all the living and\nSo on that day and\nSees the president's tang\nMany thing\nThe mood ... and\nThen\nWe argue whether native name\nA one man hanging around\nNation shame some sickness but the minute or so\nAnd how we\nMight be made whoa\nNo no one could\nSay what must these balls are living and\nSo on that then that means the president sang\nAmazing grace my president\nSang a man thing very\n\nWow yeah the last line is my president which is just switch yeah for that President and by president he says is the only president you felt of this and that way but\nUm yeah and I had to decide whether I was going to use that are not cause so we wrote it um my president\nI thought ... [laughter]\nOkay check\nEach night after a long track you recall Eli give them his medical condition and his coordinates if he was ever in trouble he could call for when he referred to as the most expensive taxi ride in the world which will be a rescue plane to pull him out\nBut\nHe also called a friend in London so he could record an audio diary of his day which could then be posted on his website and it's updated listeners about what he was going through what he was eating what he was feeling\nGood evening everybody show also\n\nOh\nHe was incredibly good looking\nHenry met his wife Joanne at a party in London in Nineteen eighty nine [noise]\nMost of my friends friends they are wild and we also that someone in the special forces was very very glamorous or [noise]\nCould ...\nI think it's great talking to people who are adventure as\nHe had recently completed his selection course for the special ear service or SAS a legendary elite commando unit\nIn many ways he enjoying a we're opposites uh she hates the cold or she could think of any more dreadful place in the world in Antarctica\nYet for all their differences they shared a similar sensibility\nReally was a tree romantic love to penetrate\nHe loved ah he he did tapestry\nHe's ditched the most wonderful\nTastes legit skating across the snow\nHe loves the history of all these old explore as them he glamorize that lives said his head\nAnd face a fit [noise]\nHenry worshipped Ernest Shackleton who in many ways a was a failure as and explore on his first expedition that he commanded some self\nHe set out to reach the south pole with three other men they got within Ninety seven miles nautical miles to the poll but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would that make it back\nAnd forth for my money\n\nAnd so I made a decision that always astonished to Henry worst flee\nHe decided to turn\nThat off\nOn his other uh most famous expedition a Shackleton had wanted to walk across Antarctica he thought it was the last great tries to be achieved but before even reached Antarctica ship or the difference that frozen in the eyes\nAnd Shackleton found him in all his men were ruined on an ice flow more than a hundred miles\nContact with civilization what made it so amazing was she was able to guide all the men in his immediate party and get them back all home alive\nI Know that they have the very for three or four\nYears I was very interested in the Charles de Gaulle Soviet your story ... guys guys expeditions\nHe began to burn with this very peculiar ambition would very few share which was the kind of suffer these misery and become a polar explorer or on the model that he lived by was a Shackleton family motto which was by endurance we conquer\nI should have had warning bells when he came back from a trip to says ... just stuff Dr ... and was incredibly excited because he had managed to sleep beside Shackleton grave it wasn't until\nWhen he was about four to ... that he does it really took about ... photo and Shackleton footsteps\nSo by the time or Henry was talking about doing his first expedition he had two children max and Alicia initially when he decided he wanted to do something that you know how many people say suddenly wait a second I Want to go walk to the south pole I'm a you know his kids were a little bit will dirt\nBut a joy and it was very supportive\nOf us were huge believe as in trying to fulfill dreams and most of the time my rich still she's from fulfilling your own individual dreams\nBecause you feel you have to get permission from the other person and I felt that through my twenties I had fulfilled a load of my dreams that had a lot of fun and he went into the army when he was Eighteen and I felt that it was his town rarely\nSo for his third trip he wanted to walk across Antarctica to fulfill the goal that his hero shocked him was not able to achieve what he wanted to do with a low\n[noise] especially if I was you know the way [noise]\nThe trial or not I am\nEach day was similar I mean Henry would get up early in the morning pack up his lead this usually took about an hour the hardest will be connected to the slide and he would begin to haul it down on like a mule\nSkiing for Ninety minutes of it and taking a five minute break\nAnd he would walk with his skis burning as much as eight thousand calories than it day\nBy being craving food cart bond brash terrible crazy statement here smaller chip slicks baked potato X Y studying\nHe would do this particularly in a task and challenge day after day there was something almost primal about a\nCold War\nHis singular purpose became to just make his mileage he had to achieve so many miles a day if he was the ultimately accomplished his goal\nNine ... ... miles today was saving everybody does in some tough guy the nine ... hard won by Carl does that long ago today just drive ... miles of this thing every\nDay Twenty one and point ... was a disappointment but she knows from all there's all I can do the night when you go a day\nHe would track for fourteen Fifteen sometimes sixteen hours across an alien landscape is covered with a sheet of ice it's possible for losses\nFor its high jacking up his ability to see the story it was a very tough to say but many causes or a breath waiting in line skates\nTicks stroke again ... where am I urge outlets during the day and it was\nA little subtle but yeah my ... again was twelve festival nine long enough [noise]\n\nTo to him I Know\nWell he was at that on the satellite than\nHe found it\nMuch harder than other expeditions and at least if you're with other people and you can take time to be at the from whereas if you delete scare\nPress has miles [noise]\nHave time to ... [noise]\nHe felt the constants\nSo that he could reach the end point of the expedition before the end of the month of January because in February begins the winter season and start to cope with the temperature drops even further it couldn't reach a minus a hundred degrees Fahrenheit\nEven Eli a shuts down then and at that point there would be no exit\nJewel and those are those so I was ... it says to them\nThey were very\nFeudal Asian guy says July ... years old\nI listen to his ... every day and they were pretty good they were pretty out bait busts or I was just very concerned that was a ... miles on his and he was old ah he was fifty five when he says that instead of [noise]\nShe could hear him growing more tired [noise]", "show_name": "New Yorker Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "14"}
