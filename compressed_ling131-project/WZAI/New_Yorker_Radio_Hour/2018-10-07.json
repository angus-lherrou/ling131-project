pretty good I actually lost to the\nFrom one World Trade center in Manhattan this is\nThe New Yorker radio our co production of WNYC Studios and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick if you watch the video of two protesters with Senator Jeff flake in an elevator during the Kavanaugh hearings if you saw them confronting with so much anger at the way women had been treated for so long\nThe way they said to a U.S senator don't look away from me look at me and tell me it doesn't matter if you look at the way flake changed his position afterwards it's all becoming clear that something absolutely remarkable is taking place in America right now\nSubjective Rebecca Traister his new book good and mad revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe book combines a kind of history of women's uprisings within analysis of the me too movement Traister is written for New York magazine el the New York times and the Washington Post and her last book was called all the single ladies unmarried women and the rise of an independent nation\nRebecca Traister and I spoke on the very day that Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh both testified about her sexual assault allegations\nRebecca there's no way to avoid this we are talking now just hours after the Senate Judiciary committee has\nDone its questioning ... there was a very specific story being told by professor Ford as well as as we near us and others ... very particular ... what did the specifics tally\nThe specifics of their stories yeah well we are getting a very full and detailed view of cultures around wealth\nWhite fundamentally patriarchal power centers that begin in you know when people are teenagers the prep school the you know Deborah Ramirez is story which was about how she was an outsider to this very elite\nUm friday hard drinking badly behaved relatively repercussion free\nUm social circle of extremely wealthy privileged white men who were all on paths toward immense power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young in a responsible I was young in a responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement it's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent\nTo the less powerful it's sort of invisible right oh oh he was drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg like wouldn't have an behave that way it's like an discernible is\nIn your book good mad you write very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf but more often about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this country how it was built and who would still excludes\nAnd systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter]\nUm this book is in large measure about\nAnger the legitimacy of anger or the ... of anger historically toward toward good um what's that you often\n[noise] um it was an attempt to\nGet my thoughts clear after the election I was a that take some doing oh gosh yes [noise]\nI didn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean I was very muddy about what the story was that I needed to tell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before and um\nThere's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women\nI was acutely aware of my identity um as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been lingered by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think\nMore clearly about race and class um that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer and there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a pod cast with a bunch of women and one of them had said\nAbout the white young white men who was like the classic Bernie supporter like she had said something like\nWhere are you guys out there trying to to persuade people to vote for Hillary because it's your guys as white men who are not voting for her where the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware\nOf this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument\nWhich is like leave him be it is not worth the investment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women do not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be philosophically right I understand and have sympathy\nWith that like just let 'em right right you know they want to they want to support a system that fundamentalists\nPeople great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys without going in my own head and I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also thinking about white women and what impulses and messages are at work\nOn white women and um I felt like it was my responsibility to examine race from the perspective of of waiting is in conjunction with looking at gender and then the anger so I I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how to do it right\nI I and that was the question about my work how do I do that what do I do what is my job what's ... what's the story here\nBut everything was so clouded [noise]\nAnd I was on a walk with my husband um between Christmas and New Years of that year says twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was feeling about like not knowing what my role was supposed to be what it was what was my work going to be professional professionally yeah\nAnd um I said I just can't think straight dries I'm I'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is\nAnd I said what do you mean and he goes well maybe that's what you need to write about is anger and as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what\nBut suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point and two months\nIt is interesting that the law to the exemplars of constructive anger in the book historically\nA black woman huh I'm Shirley Chisholm Florence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours I'm In her great hats or Rosa Parks and of course the the mother of Emmett Till\nThat's not by any coincidence that's not have the smoke by accident\nNo not at all women of color have often been\nNot only the leading activists organizers and the the people who who first gay voice in for him to a lot of the transformative social and political movements that have that have reshaped America\nUm they also often have done the thinking I mean a poly Murray who somebody I write about in this book Polly Murray was credited\nBy both Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the intellectual work she did laying out the framework for racial and gender inequity in this country and and laying the groundwork for the laws that would ultimately wind up\nI'm protecting and uh trying to ameliorate the kind of gender and racial inequality that she was she was trying to address\nAs this leader um\nAnd Florence Kennedy I haven't heard the name for the Kennedy in years I mean she's very much of the generation of Gloria Steinem or little even if she ... she and she and Gloria Steinem we're speaking partners caught on the road right to tell us a little bit about four it's kind of so Florence\nKennedy was a ... a black feminist lawyer um she was outrageous\n[noise]\n\nThat Joan Baez singing at the march on Washington Nineteen sixty three [noise]\nNext week on the New Yorker radio hour we'll look back at her part in one of the most tumultuous decades in our history [noise] you know I think\nAs I get older sometimes I Do or something to show me a photograph I think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said\nUm and sometimes going into a
