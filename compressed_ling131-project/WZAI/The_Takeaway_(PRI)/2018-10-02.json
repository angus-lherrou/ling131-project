majority of the children that garnered national attention this summer has been reunited with their parents there's another crisis in the making a record number of migrant kids in federal custody\nMost of whom cross the border alone\nThe federal government is increasingly relying on makeshift tent cities\nTexas and one is in Miami Dade County\nAnd this is not the first time the federal government has used tempting captain for migrant children this time around critics say it's a crisis of the government's own making joining me now to discuss this is Bob more an independent journalist based in El Paso who writes about the border for publications like Texas Monthly and the Washington Post high up\nI thanks for having me thanks for being with us and mark Greenberg the former head of the U.S department of health and Human Services administration for children and families under President Obama mark thanks for being with the show\nAnd thanks very much so let's start with you the federal government now has more than twelve thousand eight hundred kids in its custody that's five times as many as last year how did we get here\nOne topic a staff says is now well over Thirteen thousand according to numbers I got yesterday um children have been crossing the border unaccompanied from Central America in large numbers sense around two thousand four key mark and talk about how the Obama administration dealt with it but the Trump Administration has changed some\nPolicies you have overall sort of this climate out there that\nMakes immigrant families very unlikely to step forward and try to take sponsorship\nOf these children who arrive at the border on a company\nAnd then you had the implementation of very specific\nPolicies particularly a new requirement that any family that wants to sponsor one of these children who arrives at the border without a parent or guardian which is usually another family member must now submit their fingerprints to ice as well as the fingerprints of any adult in the household\nMost of these families of course have at least one undocumented member in the household and this is just had a massive chilling effect on the willingness of these families to\nTake these children and so they're sitting in federal custody which increasingly means thousands of them are sitting in these temporary facilities in tents are either in the desert here in Texas or or out in homestead Florida\nMark I'm going to ask we're being told that this is the highest number of migrant children being held in detention ever a but in twenty fourteen as Bob mentioned in at that point you were with the Obama administration there were far more unaccompanied children crossing the border what's the difference between twenty fourteen and today\nHappened it's

justice was once I get your most are getting on your your\nUnderstand more about the massacre in what we learned about fifty years later is Kate Doyle she's a senior analyst at the national Security Archive who's researched us and Mexican Government documents regarding the event Kate thanks for joining us\n... so\nWe are talking about a turning point in Mexican history tell us what happened fifty years ago\nToday fifty years ago there was a real by student movement that began in the spring of Nineteen sixty eight\nWith students from universities all over the city and eventually all over the country pouring out into the streets and asking really for the first time for change for freedoms for an end to police and military brutality\nFor the president of Mexico to step down for authoritarianism to end it was exciting and powerful kind of civic movement that really had no precedent in Mexico\nAnd that a movement attracted a lot of anger from the Mexican government and slowly over the course of the summer and into the fall of the movement ruin strengths and the demands became sharper and more articulate it\nThe government began to crack down and the crackdown culminated after months of back and forth between the government and the students with the terrible shootout and massacre that took place during the protests meeting\nIn the public square at ... in Mexico city on October ...\nWere killed and injured\n[noise] there were reports at the time that armed snipers were up in surrounding buildings and shot towards the plaza which then forced a military response what do we know about what exactly happened there\nSo there was a very aggressive stance on the part of the president ... that the students themselves had been firing from\nThe building overlooking the square to simply wasn't true it was a lie and what actually happened which we discovered slowly over the years that in fact the president had placed snipers in those buildings that overlooks the square where we're at ten thousand students and other people were gathered to protest\nAnd that they had fired down into the crowd in order to create a kind of chaos which would then permit the military to move in and a raft hundreds of people which is in fact what happened\nEarly in September of this year we saw major student demonstrations in Mexico city and\nI'm Wondering when you see you know students and young people getting very much political these days do you think back to what happened fifty years ago are you seeing similarities there and between what happens in Mexico today versus fifty years ago [noise] sure\nBut I don't think students are pouring into the streets because of what happened five decades ago I think they are pouring into the streets because of violence and impunity uh from the government today I think they're pouring into the streets because\nFour years ago almost to the day forty three students were grabbed by police and drug traffickers in a tiny town and get it out of the state of NATO\nAnd disappeared and I've never shown up and the government has done nothing or so the the students today yes there is a movement today there is a pushback against the government and in fact the Mexicans just voted in a person to be president um Lopez Obrador\nWho does not represent neither the ruling party nor even the sort of dominant opposition parties but a new party that he has found that so there is a kind of a ... a resurgence let's say\nOf hope for change and if demand for an end to the kind of a huge less violence that has been going on in Mexico for much too long\nAnd last week a commission from the Mexican government recognized the massacre as a state crime in your opinion you've done a ton of research on this is this\nJustice no it really is and the government commission that recognize that is is a new and important commission that is was set up by the current government opinion yet though to provide support and attention to victims of violence\nThat is not a government recognition of state responsibility for the crimes of local Mexico is a long way away from fully embracing the state's role in killing young people on October second Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd right now the government is even trying to censor and withdraw records that have been available in the archives for some years now about ... loco so Mexico has a long way to go before it is able to really face what happened on October second Lincoln sixty\nKate Doyle is a senior analyst with the national Security Archive and director of the Mexico project their Kay thank

listening or those who might be upset by conversations around sexual assault this material is explicit and be triggering\nWhen I was about Eighteen and you know the guy who's a friend of mine who I

conversations required before a sexual interaction in this current moment of me too and the emergence of decades old sexual assault allegations in the public arena\nYoung says we need to also be thinking about how to better deal with the trauma of the past and what does that reckoning look like in some cases she says it looks like dialogue I think that's a win\nIs I I think that people are starting to talk about it I mean especially given what's happened over the last year it's been almost a year since um the Harvey Weinstein allegations came out\nAnd there was a real trickle effect when that happens in Hollywood and in other parts of our society and we stopped talking about what consent looks like for ourselves in our daily lives and our insect flies in and day thing\nWhat is consent how is it being defined today and has that definition evolved\nA word you can also that question I still find it is essentially an agreement between nobody to people as to whether we move forward with sex or not\nBut it is incredibly difficult to define which is one of the things we found out in the fees and how you get to the point of consent is constantly up for debate one of the things that we throw it in this piece was ... you know needing to have a solid yes before me forward with any kind of sexual interaction\nAnd that on the face of it it's great because I Would just spell any kind of confusion around this topic but when we actually think about it you know needing to you have a yes when you strip someone's hand when you kiss someone not always seen as very sexy but maybe that's a problem with our society and a\nNorms of sexy and very month is maybe we need to start redefining then\nAnd then the question becomes well part of the question in this film is what can be gained by talking to the people who have hurt you and I think that's a really delicate\nPlace to go I'm particularly given what we're learning recently about how long it takes how these memories can be stored I mean does it help to confront the person or talk to them\nI think that it depends on your situation how trauma has manifested itself and how you feel about that particular
