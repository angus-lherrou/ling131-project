you on the take away today I'm tansy their data in a video released this week Massachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren backed\nUp her long contested claimed that she has Native American ancestry with results from a DNA test and the telling of her family story\nMy mother was born in the eastern Oklahoma\nIndian Territory until just a few years earlier when did it become\nMy daddy always said he fell head over heels in love with my first time you are\nAt my daddy's parents the hearings were bitterly to marry my mother's family read was part Native American\nPresident Trump has long taunted warns claims of native ancestry and even nicknamed her Pocahontas the accusations surrounding warns ancestry date back to two thousand and twelve what her Republican challenger for the Senate Scott Brown accused warn of using her Native American heritage to advance her career\n... brewer is a contributing editor for tribal affairs at high country news and a member of the Cherokee Nation Hi Graham Hi what was your reaction to Elizabeth Warren's decision to take this test and put out this video\nIt was very interesting I Want to be very clear I'm not here to discredit her story or the common knowledge of her family that that she's been passed down I was more concerned about the way it was talked about and and I think the method this ...\nAnd also President Trump has been very problematic from the beginning and I think using a DNA test to validate that history was probably the wrong approach\n[noise] it's interesting there because you don't want to criticize gets her intentions for doing this but then it was actually what she did write the methods the way that it was done was the issue a DNA test itself was it that it was covered up by the media inappropriately\nI think it's all of the above when we're covering Indian country weren't covering tribal communities we have to take not just look at the language we use but the way we talk about them\nThe problem I had with senator warns approach was that it kind of fosters a narrative that is damaging to native people to give you a little bit of context I I have a very similar story to Senator Warren I Am\nNot much darker than she is a outwardly the place with a video shot is probably just a couple of miles from my home I live in Norman, Oklahoma and that's where I'm Talking to you from now\nAnd so I don't fault her for wanting to know more about her history or in fact I Would encourage her to do so but I I think when you invite people to talk about the degree of of your blood quantum which is the degree of your Indian blood which is something that is documented by the government\nAnd in my case certainly you're opening up two conversations that\nFeed into stereotypes and myths about native people blood quantum is a very a thorny subject it's an institution of colonialism it was something that was put in place to essentially weed out our levels of of of native blood so by putting a stop on me\nA degree to which you're allowed to join your tribe which is a choice that tribes are able to make as they are sovereign nations\nThen it makes it less likely that your children will be able to be tribal members if they don't have the same amount of Indian blood as you do my tribe for instance the Cherokee Nation we don't have a blood quantum so as long as you can prove lineage you are a member\nUm to say that someone who is one eighth as more of a say or is more native than someone who is one thirty second for instance\nI I think is wrong I'm we're not just talking about a racial distinction here we're talking about a political distinction this is a citizenship question I Am a citizen of a sovereign nation as well as being a descendent of an indigenous person\nCan you help us understand a little bit more when you talk about\nI mean in the Native American community so when the government put many of us on the trail of tears my great great great grandfather for instance they wrote his name down where he was from and where he was headed to\nThat record still stands and it makes it easy easier to trace my lineage back to my Cherokee roots\nThat way I can show the nation that I Am a descendent of this person I Am a member of this nation and I can be enrolled us such now some tribes have blood quantum in place uh my my son for instance is also part of Iowa\nAnd the the ... nation of Oklahoma you have to be one fourth pilot to join the Navajo Nation is similar\nBut when it comes to DNA tests I think we need to keep in mind that a DNA test doesn't prove that you're a Native American there is no DNA test to shed say definitively you are an indigenous person\nWhen it comes to tribal issues DNA tests are used to show who your parents are to show that lineage to show that you are a descendent of this person it's not a test that you can take to say yes I Am Kyle or or I Am Cherokee or I Am Navajo\nI'm Wondering in terms of the media coverage of this did you feel like native perspective we're being included in the reaction to senator warrants decision on to release this video\nFelt like there was a lot of attention given to Senator Warren how she feels about Trump's rhetoric towards her which I Will agree is is not okay it's not acceptable the way President Trump speaks to her about race\nBut I felt there was more emphasis on how Senator Warren was affected by it rather than how her response affects indigenous people\nI think her response helps foster this narrative that like I said her blood quantum is important or the DNA tests can prove that your indigenous neither one of those things are true it reactions I have seen from indigenous scholars writers and just regular tribal members off the street\nIs is mostly one of anger they're not happy with the way that this has shaped the public discussion\nThey don't feel like Senator Warren has made efforts to understand them or their perspective and they feel again like\nTheir own narrative is being perverted and the public eye I think we need to keep in mind that when we're talking about indigenous communities we're talking about some of the most isolated communities in the country and I don't just mean physically yes some of those communities are isolated physically\nBut there is an invisibility problem with Indian country non native people by and large don't understand\nPoverty they don't understand a tribal membership and they don't understand like I was saying that this is a citizenship question as well as a racial distinctions I think all of those things together just compound the problem of misperceptions and stereotypes that permeates popular culture when it comes to Native American people\n... brewer is a reporter with the high country news

[noise]\n\nI'm Tenzing Vega welcome back to the takeaway\nWe've been talking about the Proud Boys and the rise of far right hate groups with tiny Hernandez professor of law at Fordham University and the author of the forthcoming book multi racial and civil rights also with us is David ... author of all to America the rise of the radical right in the age of Trump and a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center\nAnd Tanya I Want to pick up what you what is the driving force behind men in particular some men of color to have joined this group is that racism is it ...\nIt is both I mean talk about a parody medic intersection all example that is the conflation together of both of jet anti gender bias and race bias the ways in which this\nToxic white masculinity and men of color are no exception to set of\nBeing seduced by the superficial power that that ah offers up\nIs it become an easier to sell in this current climate it is most definitely easier to sell because it combines both\nA quotes of Martin Luther king about not being racist at the same time that he talks about whiteness as being a culture that is worth uplifting as if you could take away from this ah racism\nI'm just curious how it is that people of color who are not by definition white Kennan gauge with that type of thinking\nUp because what they do is they disassociate this idea of waiting is that culture from racism and any anti blackness has also reduce the IDF oh something about blackness it's about\nFat black culture David what's your sense of that I mean are you seeing is this a new form of hate group ideology that we're seeing across the United states [noise]\nWell in some ways it's actually very old I mean I started doing this when I was covering the area missions and Idaho in late seventies early eighties\nAnd date to claim that they were only for white [laughter] and it's one of the realities of for its premises groups is that you know the claim to just be pro white and defending white\nInterests but inevitably there pro white advocacy becomes a tax on other races but that's not how they sell themselves and of course what really is the underlying dynamic here is less white supremacist them\nThan authoritarianism and that's what they're selling and authoritarianism crosses all kinds of racial and ethnic and religious boundaries I'm you know we've got\nOne of our main sort of a ... boy groups out here on the west coast is called patriot prayer and they're headed by a guy who's Japanese American and his right hand man is big ... guy\nSo uh yeah ... and I see all kinds of non white guys joining their rights but of what I talk to them\nEvery one of them has what we call it right wing authoritarian personality sunnier\nYou wanted to weigh in here will tell you that I just wanted to throw in the idea that um it's not new but yes it is in some respects and and as much as that now these white supremacist groups are claiming to be welcoming to people of color\nI'm not just that they're pro white and this is just about culture and that they're not actually racist but they were OK with having non white members be part of their best\nMuch by authoritarianism agree with you there they're also spouting lots of pro white rhetoric at I don't think we should be dismissing that as I say in his budget has about authoritarianism it doesn't mean that fight about race\nYeah no that's absolutely right um it is this very interesting mix and it's also it's an interesting mix of all the new because uh they're marketing it in ways that\nI mean the always the radical right was very backward looking and the shape of the ... radical right as very savvy very media savvy and very forward looking which is a problematic\nWell I also want to talk about the initial response to this here at least in New York City um the NYPD the New York police department said on Monday that it did have plans to arrest or nine members of the Proud Boys and three more anti fascist opponents but\nFootage from the fight that night shows the police arriving they disperse the crowd but none of the Proud Boys actually were arrested and there were\nSome accusations that the police the NYPD didn't do enough to stop the attackers there was also an assumption that there was support here from the implicit support for the the the Proud Boys from the NYPD\nDavid do you think there's a level of support within law enforcement for right far far right groups like the Proud Boys yes\nI Do um I Believe that actually our law enforcement system throughout the country right now as as\nBeing you know very heavily politicized by organizations like the oath keepers a which specifically you know this is essentially a patriot\nVery far right organization that is recruiting law enforcement uh and they're succeeding so yeah I've been out covering a lot of these and I would say Portland police in particular are very prone\nTo uh acting in defense of the the right wing side and I'm very much uh acting against the they very much see the ah anti fascist says the bigger problem and I think that's a problem\nTanya your your thoughts on what I find fascinating about this David is that I think another aspect of this is that even for the police officers who don't actually view themselves as being invested in this white supremacy authoritarianism\nI think are very much swayed by the idea that what they are observing are it's just about free speech right that these folks are chest spouting their ideas and I think that part of the underlying problem here is the stereotype of the United states as being so absolute is about free speech\nOn the street and it doesn't matter and it doesn't seem to me that it results in violence although history shows us how intimately into intertwined racist speech is with racist\nViolence I Do want to point out that we did reach out to the NYPD the takeaway did for comment about their response specifically to this incident and also\nThe claim that Gavin McGinnis said that he actually was supported by the NYPD so I'm going to read you a brief um a response from the NYPD and they say that they called me and it's an individual who's a provocateur tour who does not speak for the NYPD\nThey say the NYPD is a diverse institution dedicated to keeping safe all eight point five million New Yorkers violence and disorder like what occurred on October twelve is unacceptable and will not be tolerated and the the statement does go on so they did respond to this request\nAt the national level what do you see uh do you see this as a trend that is going to continue to catch on is this something that'll go back underground what's your experience tell you\nYeah my experiences doesn't really help this because this was all ... I'm I'm obviously I think we all hope it goes back on the ground but are not very hopeful in that regard because I think this is very much a creature of the Internet\nDavid night where it is the author of all to America the rise of the radical right in the age of Trump and a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center and tiny Hernandez is a professor of law at Fordham University and author of the forthcoming book multi racial and civil rights [noise]\nComing up we'll look at the economic relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia stay with us\nFor the takeaway comes from novel on language out that teaches real life conversations in a new language like Spanish French horn German\nBattles and a Fifteen minute lessons are available and the app store or online at that will be a B.
