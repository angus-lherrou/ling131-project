hundred thousand dollars a year in today's dollars from his father's wealth and real estate empire by the time he was eight he was a millionaire\nAnd total the president receive four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire that's according to a scathing investigation by the New York times one of the longest peace is ever published by the paper\nThe investigation was based on more than one hundred thousand pages of documents charted the financial history of the Trump family business\nAnd the extent to which Donald Trump profited off of the transfer of wealth from his father Fred Trump the report detailed signs of tax evasion and very likely tax fraud involving sham corporations undervalued real estate holdings in schemes to avoid inheritance taxes\nIn total one billion that's billion with a beat dollars in wealth was transferred from the Trump parents to the Trump children instead of paying fifty five percent of tax on those funds the times investigation found that Trump's pay just five percent tax that's basically the equivalent of about five hundred million dollars in taxes that went unpaid\nJenny Johnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson more in Chicago and she joins me now Jenny thanks for being with the takeaway\nThank you so much for having me so lots to unpack here but let's start with your brought assessment is what the New York times found fraud\nThere certainly parts of this that are fraud\nUm tax avoidance our tax minimization that is perfectly well within the confines of the law and then there are parts of that that you know very significantly cross the line\nAnd we of course should mention that the president's lawyer told the New York times that the allegation of tax fraud innovations were quote\nOne hundred percent false and highly defamatory um despite that the times found two hundred and Ninety five distinct streams of revenue created by Fred Trump to help transfer this money to his son Donald Trump\nWhich is quite frankly I'm a pretty incredible and one of the ways that they did that was by creating a company called all county building supply and maintenance and they use that company to supposedly by things like cleaning supplies\nBut in the times investigation they found that basically it was a shell company was a company on paper and they would mark up the costs of products as a way of transferring the money is unpack skiffs is that tax fraud\nI Believe that it is based on my review of the allegations in the times article if if those facts are true\nThis is tax fraud and one of the key concepts in tax law is that the economic substance needs to match what you put on paper and what you report to the IRS and this company had no economic substance it was nearly a way of funneling gifts from the president's father to the president of his siblings\nOne of the other things we mentioned at the top is that the uh the trumps also undervalued they're real estate properties and according to this investigation and the New York times Fred Trump's\nNineteen Ninety five gift tax return he claimed that twenty five apartment complexes he owned were valued at forty one point four million but the New York times says the bank value was actually near nine hundred million what about that is it clear that that's tax fraud\nIt's not as clear um because you need to understand the way that valuations occur and the kinds of discounting that is is actually appropriate and in normal when looking at a minority interest in a company\nSo you start with a value and if if that value is wrong then everything following it is wrong and in this case it looks like that value is probably wrong\nBut it's not as clear cut because we we don't have the competing evaluations done by another expert as of the same approximate date we're looking at things that happened years after and things do change over the course of time\nHighly likely to be wrong but whether it and and subject to civil penalties whether that amounts to fraud or not is more questionable\nI guess the question that this is sort of all coming from our tax code in the United states which I think you know I Want to warn our listeners don't let your eyes glaze over when I say tax code um who does the tax code favor I mean is it something that wealthier\nFamilies in wealthier Americans are more savvy about and know how to make get their way around these types of loopholes\n[noise] yeah I\nI think wealthy Americans are more savvy but I also think they need to be you know I think an important thing to remember here is that the estate tax only applies to the wealthiest individuals and families you know it only kicks in and now this year if and when you die you have more than ... eleven million dollars\nSo it's not like these people are avoiding attacks they'd is generally applicable to the rest of the population like when they are avoiding income tax and other people are paying their fair share of income tax\nIn a state tax you know it's I it's a creation of Congress that only applies to the wealthy and then there are other creations of Congress that minimize the amount those same people have to pay\nA and if you follow the rules um then you're abiding by the law the problem here is that the rules were not really followed\nIt feels like they weren't followed but it also I think for a lot of Americans I think there's a sense of frustration among those of us who pay our taxes and don't you know find these loopholes and and are paying a significant amount of our income in taxes versus the wealthy who kind of seem to be able to get around this\nI think that's more of a valid complaint with income tax but the state tax none of the rest of us pay estate tax do the wealthy pay a state tax yes significant portions of it and you know sometimes they can minimize the amount that they have to pay\n... and what is that what you know is that normal behavior of the ultra wealthy in this country\nMinimizing the amount of state taxes absolutely normal behavior committing fraud to do it is not normal behavior or how do we distinguish the two you have to look at the amounts and whether the violation of the laws will fall\nAnd you know the IRS has a whole set of penalties that that they used to apply based on how undervalued the properties we're in the estate tax returns\nJohnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson more in Chicago Jenny thanks for being with the takeaway\n\n... supported by timeshare exit gene doping
