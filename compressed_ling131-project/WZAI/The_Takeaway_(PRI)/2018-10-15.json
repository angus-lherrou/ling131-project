because she'll be entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey and hasn't been seen since according to reports Saudi officials allegedly tortured and murdered and may have even dismembered the Washington Post columnist claims which the Saudi state strongly denies\nOn friday reports emerged that Turkish authorities have audio and video recordings\nConfirming that cause show he was killed inside the Saudi consulate\nThose recordings have not yet been made public but now Saudi Arabia says Turkish officials can search their consulate meanwhile US Senators are pushing the Trump Administration to consider sanctions on the Saudi Government and business leaders are pulling out of a future economic conference being hosted by the kingdom\nSarah as these as a journalist covering human rights in the middle east\nHi Sarah thank you so much for having me on so if the Saudis\nHave denied any involvement in the disappearance of ... and I'm so far that's been absent any proof as far as we know a there was just a breaking news alerts that they are now allowing Turkish investigators into the consulate what's your sense on what's that could mean yeah\nThat certainly an interesting development however really\nIs the Saudi officials may be and we have\nHad 'em outside officials allowed on the premise is once before but it was very tightly controlled sort of more of a curated sewer than an investigation keep in mind that the Saudis have had almost two weeks to make whatever preparations they might mean to in order to ensure that this quote investigation\nUm wouldn't go favorably for them so it's perhaps a positive development but you know we should be definitely be skeptical whatever may arise from that visit\nSo of course President Trump of the world is watching to see what the United States a reaction would be President Trump was on sixty minutes this weekend and he said that there would be quote severe punishment if the Saudis were found to be involved with ... disappearance\nWould you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed\nWith depends on what the sanctions will give you an example they ordering military equipment everybody in the world wanted that order Russia want her to China wanted it we want it is we got it and we got all of it every bit of the\nQuestion I have for you is what kind of punishment are we talking about he's sort of talked around sanctions are sanctions still on the table\nThat is definitely a matter of debate at this precise moment we've had some members of Congress saying that they would want to go that far you know for the U.S that has such a strong and longstanding economic relationship with Saudi Arabia sanctions are treated sort of as\nThe ultimate boundary of of the possible it's a red line for some people who tend to want it to focus on a more incremental perhaps more cultural soft reprimand towards the Saudi Government whereas others\nSay that that is the only really effective way the only way to really convey the level of severity that they see in this case so I think God what everyone's really watching as the\nThe threat that Saudi issued in response to some of these hands on which is threatening to raise the oil price is threatening to retaliate um\nAs far as the oil production goes so\nWe'll we'll we'll have to see 'em what risks our government is actually willing to take but oil on weapons sales there certainly are you know the meat and potatoes the foundation of our relationship with Saudi Arabia\nAnd you did speak with ...\nRegarding the Saudi state and the Saudi crown prince\n[noise] yeah absolutely I spoke with ... uh several times for a few pieces I was doing I'm On the escalating crackdowns that the growing on suppression of all\nAll types of free speech and free expression in the kingdom on ... on a really shared with me some of his concerns that I'm a well Saudi Arabia had never been a bastion of human rights are free speech um\nThere had been a little bit of latitude a little bit of space for the press for academics and religious leaders to perhaps\nDiffer with the royal family to a degree within some you know pledge of loyalty to the Saudi royal family however under Mohammed bin Salman we saw an increasing pattern of preemptive strikes the crown prince was locking up people who had\nNot necessarily criticized him at all but ... whom he just feared might object right before he gave women the right to drive for example he locked up a lot of\nThe country's most conservative clerics in order to sort of head off any conservative critique and then at the same time he was censoring 'em or arresting academics and intellectuals on the more liberal side sort of just demonstrating a need to completely control the narrative\nFrom the top down as far as his reforms in his reputation and Jamal as a journalist really felt like he could no longer practice his craft as a journalist with any integrity um many people are being asked to sign loyalty pledges he was receiving increasing\nPressure from the government and um he grew really disheartened with the regime he loved Saudi Arabia\nHe really expressed a lot of regret that he had felt the need to leave his family and his job in many many colleagues behind but he told me you know Saudi Arabia deserves better and this crown prince\nMain market um one thing may market a bright future for Saudi Arabia but without freedom of speech and freedom of the press that the really hollow promise\nSara as these as a freelance

college admissions a nonprofit group called students for fair admissions is suing Harvard University alleging that the schools admissions policies discriminate against Asian American applicants\nSpearheading the lawsuit is a conservative activist named Edward Blum was organized efforts to end affirmative action before here's how he describes the problem\nIt's Richard discrimination and it's a quota for the quarter today's against Asians much like the quarter back in the Nineteen twenties and thirties was against Jews the issues surrounding this case have opened\nCommunity we spoke to a couple of students\nMy name is Ken issue I was junior at Davidson College number writer for the federalist I'm an Asian American but to me you know the critical part of that is not an American and I think that I Want to be lifted on on the basis of my qualifications and all the content of my character\nFrom rather than the way the Harvard which Asian Americans reading them for personalities I'm reading the people that are less desirable college strictly because they're raised\nMy name is Sally ten I'm a current senior at Harvard College studying history and literature and studies of women's gender and sexuality Asian Americans are being used as a\nRacial wedge in a lot of ways either way of propping up against other people of color and utilizing the quote unquote model minority meant to perpetuate these ideas about who\nDeserves to be in these institutions\nI'm personally for equal treatment of all races regardless of your race or ethnicity I think that people should be treated on the basis of merit and opportunity I take that\nSome anytime of college such a different kind of racial balancing positioning thing by necessity usually involves turning away from people who were more merited and taking and people who are less qualified\nI truly believe that my admission file of my application\nCould not have been as compelling as it ended up being for by admissions officer\nHad I not been able to talk about my race in a really meaningful way along with my other identities as a child of immigrants as a first generation college student at someone who comes from a low income family it doesn't adjusted to all students including Asian Americans\nHuge tried to portray us as if we are a monolith\nI grew up around Princeton New Jersey area so um there are a lot of people there were very academic and very obsessed with college and so I think that when when you have that kind of environment it really doesn't help\nWhen school at Harvard basically says you owe drought petition is not worth as much as another guy's application because it looks like they're trying to Carter because it seems like you're not worthy based on characteristics that you know we can't change about ourselves\nDon't think they're the person on the campus to kick deny that they have benefited\nFrom having a diverse student body and a diverse campus I think that in fact the conversation has evolved to actually be\nAbout how\nFor it's good to do better recruiting get diversity within diversity thinking about Asian Americans as being\nThe rise of multiple ethnic groups including Southeast Asians and in more recent immigrants and Pacific Islanders [noise]\nJoining me now to discuss the lawsuit against Harvard is Natasha worry coups and associate professor of education at Harvard University\nAnd author of the diversity bargain thanks for being here Natasha thank you for having me\nAlso with us in Studio in New York as well shoot staff writer for the New Yorker well thanks\nFor being still to be here so Natasha let's start with you or you're currently at Harvard University which is being sued in this case are you involved in this lawsuit in any way no I'm not to tell us a little bit about how harbors policy admissions work where does race\nFactor in if it factors in at\nAll [noise] so how has a holistic admissions policy which means that\nThe admissions office looks at a whole host of factors when deciding whether to admit students um this includes of course academics but in addition to academics it's also looking at articulate or um talents that a student might have outside of the academics like musical talent perhaps someone has done some\nPretty serious science research they are also looking at athletics and you know manning the sports teams I'm of course the legacy that are part of this and race is one of these factors\nParticularly under represented groups African American let let the you know Native American groups I'm a kind of diverse or make sure that those voices are part of the student body on campus to\nProvide a diverse learning environment\nYou mentioned on the under represented groups who did not mention Asian Americans or legacy students that I'm Wondering why that was\nYes children of people who went to Harvard has some kind of affiliation get a kind of closer look they get an extra read and you know they do get a small leg up\nAnd uh in terms of Asian Americans university denies that their penalizing Asian Americans in the admissions process and what the scientists are trying to do in this case is a tie this question of are Asian Americans penalized views of the whites to\nOur whites penalized because of the um underrepresented minorities\nI should say under the law there is a compelling state interest to give a boost to underrepresented minorities for this diverse learning environment the Congress is not true between you know when we're comparing Asian Americans to whites in admissions\nWhy I wanted to come to you because you just wrote a big piece about this in the New Yorker you interviewed several\n... are in support of the lawsuit can you give us a sense of why they feel that way why they stand there yeah I think\nThere's a lot of division within the Asian American community it might not be as great as has also reported but there is a very small very vocal group within the Chinese American immigrant population that is very much invested in notions of opportunity meritocracy\nAnd you know they often spoke about the American dream in a way that I think a lot of people who've been in America wild don't necessarily sort of see is contractually binding\nAnd it just sort of this perfect storm Edward Blum is really interested in changing the cultural conversation around affirmative action around\nRace consciousness and a lot of these\nPredominantly I Would say middle class I'm fairly kind of well to do single issue Chinese American voters particularly in suburban areas they don't really experience the diversity that a college campus might provide for them or you know they just see this as taking something away from them\nOkay guys hang
