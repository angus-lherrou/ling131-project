[noise]\n[noise]\nThe past few days President Trump has been crisscrossing the country stumping for Republican candidates in the lead up to the mid term elections\nAnd one of the biggest talking points\nFear of immigration what's happening\nA large group of people they care of it [noise]\nShe's referring there to the caravan of Central American migrants that's been growing since the first set off almost two weeks ago from Honduras and migrants have now reached southern Mexico where many are requesting asylum others will continue the arduous weeks long journey by foot to the United states\nThe president has made no secret of his feelings about certain groups of immigrants [noise]\nYou wouldn't believe the streets [noise]\nAre animals they're bringing drugs they're bringing crime rape is they are not our friend believe me I don't Jay Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United states\nSo we want to take some time today to do some fact checking on this caravan of migrants coming from Central America\nGoing to the middle of the garbage your cameras and search for five minutes or\nI guess what we're not allowed in our guts\nHere to help us unpack all of this is Ron next and the New York times correspondent covering the department of homeland security Ron thanks for being with us and thanks for having me\nSo lots of stuff to take into consideration here we just heard the president's comments about uh they're being middle Easterners and the caravan he later said he had no proof of that but clearly this was a dog whistle I'm thinking who within the caravan Ron what do we know\nThese are people that are primarily migrating and seeking to uh get asylum primarily coming from Honduras and I understand that there's some people from Guatemala and maybe a couple of other places in the northern trying all countries [noise] but uh it looks largely like it's it's a group of people coming from Honduras\nNow we also heard I'm Mike Pence vice president Mike Pence and Sarah Huckabee Sanders who were saying that there are about ten terrorists or suspected terrorists come into the United states every day that was something that they are set around this caravan let's take a listen to a vice president pets\nWell it's inconceivable that there are not um people of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand people\nAdvancing toward our border\nIt can ... well let me let me just to six on this I mean in in the last fiscal year\nOf oh we apprehended more than more than ten terrorists or suspected terrorists per day at our southern border from countries that are referred to in a lecture punish other than Mexico that means from the middle east region\nRon does other than Mexico mean from the middle east\nOther than Mexico includes everybody from Mexico and they know it's not a direct them into okay no no including people from the northern triangle and and that's primarily who's been referred to as other than in Mexico but it it really does include anyone who is not from Mexico and nuts because\nTraditionally up until a few years ago most of the people seeking to come across the border\nEither get asylum or crossing the border illegally were people from Mexico\nAnd non what about those stats the vice president is fighting about terrorists being apprehended at the border\nThat's that that the vice president mentions come from um customs and border protection the parent agency of border patrol and it basically\nPrevents tend known or suspected terrorists from traveling to are entering the United states every day and fiscal two thousand ah Seventeen\nIt makes no mention of them being apprehended at the border uh and it doesn't say specifically that they're coming\nTo the southwest border that typically has meant that these people are being stopped from coming the airport so\nYeah it it's called fleeting as that that is meant to be one thing with this whole caravan it and it has nothing to do as far as I can tell with this caravan of people\nHe's also made some claims about him is Thirteen and I don't want to minimize the concern about him is Thirteen um but I Do want to check with you to see is there any evidence of MS Thirteen so far being a part of this group or having any influence over this group\nI haven't seen anything that that suggests that MS Thirteen is is a part of a group in the president's comments about ticket camera and go in the middle of a caravan and you'll see him as Thirteen I I don't know what a mess Thirteen would look like I mean there are certainly\nYou know a members that have facial tattoos and things like that but not everybody who's ... him as Thirteen looks like that so [noise]\nYou know as far as as I Know and from my colleagues on the ground there and and my coverage of this we have not seen any any evidence of that today\nThere's another concern um and I I I think this is a really a question of language and dog whistles out when it comes to race and politics and I'm Wondering are the Republicans nervous here on do you think that's why they're doubling down on this rhetoric just two weeks before the midterm election\nI think immigration I'm you know obviously it it helped to president get elected and this has been one of if not these signature issue for this administration\nAnd I think that for a lot of Republicans ... plays well a particularly now you see cameras with this crowd of people coming to the country and you can point to see they're they're they are there are these people who are trying to to get into our country\nUm so I I think for them you know it's it's an issue or that they feel they can gain some traction with as you know political scientists and pollsters are predicting a blue wave particularly uh in in terms of taking the house of representatives\nYeah we've also heard a Mike Pence said that it is a the ... the Venezuelan plot\nThat the caravan as being supported by Democrats and George sources name has been tossed about can we confirm any of those\nClaims there is no evidence that the Democrats are George stories or Venezuela have sponsors of this particular caravan and an women but this is uh something bad happened earlier this year too there was a caravan of people come to us and most of them\nActually didn't make the trip to the U.S it it sort of petered out before it actually got to the U.S border so ultimately we don't know what's going to happen\nWith this group of people because they're about a thousand miles away right which is more\nThan Miami to New York from what I Am right now yeah right and they're walking right so take that into consideration thank you Ron Nixon is a correspondent for the New York times covering the

D science in San Francisco and she's been reporting on the measure as well as the origins of the practice and the case against it today Danielle thanks for being with us on the takeaway\nThank you for having me so what is where did this ballot measure come from who wanted to eliminate daylight saving time in California\n[noise] this is from a state assembly member sponsored by a state assembly member in San jose and he heard about the issue from his constituents um it was his dentist actually who showed him medical studies that link that loss of an hour of sleep and the spring to increased stroke\nTraffic accidents and heart attack\nWow so there's actual um consequences to clock changes\nThere's pretty good data that that loss of sleep um throws off people's circadian rhythms disoriented them and I'm puts them at higher risk of all of those things\nSo it's not just that we're grumpier there's actual real change interesting what what's the case for ... like what is the case that there that are in addition to any of the health concerns are there other reasons why a prop seven wants to be a white white folks are pushing props up\nYeah I mean it's a pretty unpopular practice to switch clocks feathers and popular support for keeping the clock steady or around also when we are using daylight savings time we have that more light in the evening\nAnd there is some economic benefit because a public health benefit because people are exercising their out eating at restaurants they're playing sport there walking the dog\nNow why do we have daylight saving time in the first place can you remind us\n[noise] yeah the idea dates back centuries it was Benjamin Franklin who wrote the first proposal he was probably joking but at the time out if it was in the late Seventeen hundreds he was living in France he was the American ambassador to Paris and it was his habits to sleep or to work late late into the\nW ... members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming ... member visit Cape and islands dot org\nTo write by I don't need to spend all this money on candles um but it wasn't until World War one that it was really adopted by countries it was a Germany\nThe was the first country to Institute it and then I'm all of the countries that were involved in the war effort adopted daylight saving time to save energy and it did use to save some energy it\nDoesn't say much now it seems um it was then made optional between the wars brought back again and the United states for World War two\nAnd in California voters um voted to Institute that the daylight savings time schedule that we have now are in Nineteen forty nine\nNow some of our listeners may remember the last time the United states didn't switch to standard time which was back in Nineteen Seventy four during the oil crisis can you tell us what happened then\n[noise] yeah I'm President Nixon ordered year round daylight saving time for two years to save to save energy\nDuring the OPEC oil embargo but it was incredibly in popular because it meant very cold very dark mornings especially in the northern latitudes and it was so unpopular that Congress ended the experiment I'm a year early\nNow I'm Wondering about you you mentioned northern latitudes now is daylight saving time something that really helps um those of us in the north and maybe hurts those of us in the south who are closer to the equator\n[noise] well I wouldn't say that it hurts people who are closer to the equator\nBut the shift of light versus dark is of course much more drastic in the northern latitudes in on the equator we have\nTwelve hours of darkness and twelve hours of light so here for instance in California if this proposition passed and California did indeed go to a year round\nSaving time the son wouldn't rise in the in the shortest days of the year in LA until about eight but in the northern parts of the state that would it wouldn't rise until about eight forty five\nWow that's pretty intense you know we did ask our listeners um for what they thought about this idea and there were lots of folks who supported as we mentioned earlier you know there's a lot of support in California for this right now but I Do want to play you a comment from one California\nPointless measure that what is resources that could be used for other issues like health care homelessness education pathway for immigration prison reform the list is endless even if the measure passes it still needs to be approved by Congress and who knows how long that would take Ivo no\nDidn't you know we've just got a coming up on the end of the segment here but it's not an accurate representation would it take resources away from needed services to make this change\nYou know the fiscal impact is really unclear it would require some extra money to coordinate airline flights and you know with other states but it also could save money
