on the series of promises to be\nDoes it on the ballot this here but I mean the term election is kind of like those mid term tests he took back in school for the first real assessment of all you've done in class for the first part of the semester [noise]\nAnd they're supposed to get you ready for the big one final\nVoters use the midterm elections to send a message to the president they take a look back at the last two years and greatest the more unhappy they are with the president some more likely they vote against members of his party in November [noise]\nHappy with him they support the members of his party\nOne way voters evaluate our president is doing this to look at whether he's filled the promises he made us candidate but we also do voters evaluate the president on more than just policy they look at things like leadership temperament comports himself in a job\nBut today's episode will specifically look at what he said he was going to do on the campaign trail and whether he's comes through on those commitments\nAnd there's a lot to get it [noise]\n\nWe begin with foreign policy\nSo I Do believe that Trump had had an extremely consequential foreign policy presidency so far in ways that are often under rated by the way both by critics\nOf his and buy some orders that Susan Glasser staff writer for the New Yorker\nShe has almost singlehandedly because even his own party largely does not support much of this agenda on foreign policy in particular he is more or less singlehandedly\nReorientate American foreign policy it seems to me away from me rules based or values based foreign policy and toward an extremely transactional unilateral view of the United states in the world a much more Machiavellian great powers\nThe might rule the strong do as they will kind of view of the world\nPresident Trump bran on a few key promises when it comes to foreign policy one and the most important in all real dealings he'd put America First\nUs and become too attached a multinational relationships deals that weren't directly benefiting the U.S he also insisted that under his leadership the world would respect us again an idea premised on the false notion that the world did not respect the United states before\nYou're probably going to make some huge analytical mistakes and I think that you know Trump again has been fairly consistent in certain areas of expressing preferences that are then translated policy if you didn't think he was going to withdraw from the Iran deal\nAs some serious foreign policy people thought or convince themselves you were wrong says lesser thanks for joining us thank you so much coming up we turn to Trump's promises on trade and who's guaranteed to bring back American Jobs stay with us on the take away

international collaboration with elegant GPA's radio in Boston\n[noise] we continue our look at Trump's promises from twenty sixteen campaign to pick up now on trade [noise] then candidate Trump rent on a message of blow it up a bad deal\nI'm going to do or not the part that I intend to immediately renegotiate germs that agreement I Am going to withdraw the night it strikes from the Trans Pacific partnership and I'm going to direct the secretary of commerce identify\nEvery violation of greater during\nA foreign country is current news do harm to the American worker\nSo how has he done you've had the very tough and very consistent in some ways anti free trade anti globalization and typically anti China views that Trump's a candidate Trump to president to ... [noise]\nThat Susan Glasser again he pulled out of the TPP the Trans Pacific\nPartnership which was the major regional trade deal negotiated in the course of the Obama administration that was meant to be the major American and its allies response to Chinese economic and increasingly security a muscle flexing in the region\nThere's been no clear strategy to replace that except to engage in that escalation on the economic front and here's Alex\nOn international trade\nIt's definitely true to say that he has carefully gone about sort of restructuring America's trade deals and I say carefully only in the sense that\nWhile he would tell you that these are historical groundbreaking rewrites of past American trade deals most people will tell you that it's a little more weedy and a little more nuanced than that\nSo let's get into that nuance\nMost recently of course they has\nRewritten be North American free trade agreement and while it stops short of I think sharing all the ills of the old NAFTA that Trump's ran on doing on fixing 'em it is definitely an improvement in the sense of just people conduct business differently\nThan they did in Nineteen Ninety four when it came into effect\nBut here's the thing to understand a lot of what they agreed to in the new NAFTA deal was already part of the Trans Pacific partnership agreement negotiated under President Obama that President Trump withdrew from\nIn Canada and Mexico we're in agreement that was considered Obama's NAFTA rewrite he also promised to rewrite NAFTA on the campaign trail in two thousand eight um and that was waiting for Trump when he got there but instead of picking it up and asking Congress to pass it immediately withdrew the United states in the trade agreement he said it was terrible you never really gave specific somewhat he didn't like\nSo it's a little disingenuous I think for him to say none of this happens without me and the way I impose these tariffs to apply pressure on them that's just not the case\nThe one thing that are two issues at the Trump Administration points to specifically the auto sector and on dairy and parrots or these brand new topics that the president was able to negotiate into this new NAFTA deal\nYou have touched on the issue at least that are the most different now there was a lot of work done on improving dairy market access into Canada in GDP\nWe got a little bit more in this new NAFTA but it's by you know a couple of different decimal points but ah the automotive rules are very interesting um it Heather's tariffs benefits for cars to a minimum wage of at least sixteen dollars an hour and that is new that was not in the TPP\nLet's talk about terrorists early in the president's administration there was a lot of handwringing especially from folks on Wall street some people with in the president's in ministry ... saying\nWe gotta stop all this Paris talk the economy when great the more we talk about parents the better chance that we knock this really great economy off the rails\nAnd quite well and the president hasn't stopped talking about parent does that mean the president has succeeded in using parents as a tool for getting what he wants for the U.S on trade\nWhile you're correct that the economy is still very robust and growing but\nI Would say and many economists will tell you that the strength of the U.S economy is what is shielding the president from the adverse effects of terrorists not it's growing because of terrorists and as far as what he was hoping to achieve it seems entirely political to me at this point we began by talking about when he campaigned on and talk trade enforcement in the form of terrorists was part of that\nYou know I Will counter unfair trade practices by several partners namely China but it's it's manifested in other partners as well and that's what's happened\nBut it's not really forcing anyone to the negotiating table you know he claims that NAFTA doesn't happen without tariffs but as I just laid out these are two of our closest allies they will always sit down and talk with us and asked us now\nBasically what you're seeing is a terrorist beginning to take root and the most rapid escalation has been with China that the terrorists now covered to hundred and fifty billion dollars worth\nOf Chinese goods and those are beginning to cover consumer goods the last round of tariffs started to cover all electronics computers furniture or things like that conventional economic theory tells you that you're gonna start to see prices raised on that\nAnd even though he can go out on the campaign trail and say you see I impose these tariffs 'cause I'm at work for you\nThe forward thinking you know voter will say okay yes you did that\nBut what is it actually do for us that's sort of where we're at on terrorists here it's true that he's impose them and through that he kept to his word on that\nBut on a broader scale I don't know that there's anything they can point to in say the terrorists got you ... you know there's really no they're they're\nThe other thing the president talked a lot about as a candidate with the issue of the trade deficit and how large it was has there been a significant change in the trade deficit since he's been president\n[noise] he had a significant changes that it has actually gone up quite a bit since he's come into office it's been an interesting tight rope for critics to walk because well he said I'm working on reducing a trade deficit um it continues to climb\nBut at the same time critics also said when he made those arguments the trade deficit if it's high isn't really like necessarily a bad thing for our economy in many contexts it can be the mark of a very healthy economy because consumers are embolden to buy things the Trump Administration and President Trump himself\nIt's sort of a like a bank account right it's just like look at us losing all this money either not understanding or willfully distorting the fact that it's actually just private companies and citizens who wants to buy things with their money it's not like we're flushing money down the drain we have great purchasing power in this country and we're using it\nThe other thing the president talked a lot about as a candidate and he still does today which is to say listen I'm a free trader I'm not anti free trade I'm just fair trade if you had to agree to this president on a free trade scale where would you put him\nI mean it's it's in the ... range I don't understand how anybody could look at two years of like rapidly and largely unprecedented leases the Nineteen thirties\nLargely unprecedented escalation of of tariffs both with allies and with countries were more contentious and say this is a free trade president I think that's such a foolish they just stay with us raid that you're a free trader\nI'm from us and thanks for joining us appreciate and\nAlex Lawson is senior reporter on international trade for law

repealing Obamacare [noise]\nSince the campaign President Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable CARE Act otherwise known as Obamacare Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news host of the what the health podcast she tells us how well he's done so far\nThe administration has done quite a bit actually started Congress the big thing that Congress did was in the tax bill after they were unable to pass their repeal and replace legislation they eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance to the individual mandate penalty the president also cut off federal funding also for a ...\nW ... members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nGiving not only those people discounts but some other people discounts to\nThe other big thing the administration has done is it allowed different kinds of insurance plans with basically lesser benefits then are required under Obamacare um they're called short term planting some that are called association health plans\nAnd the concern is that healthier people will move into these kinds of plant because they're cheaper but the problem is they don't offer very much and sometimes it's not entirely clear\nWhat they don't offer until you discover that you need something so those are sort of the big things that have happened to the law in the last year um president likes to say the law is dead and then the next breath he likes to say but we fixed it\nAnd he also talked a lot as a candidate saying that the health care premiums are going up one point he said they're going up forty fifty fifty five percent\nThey're still talk from the White House and Republicans that premiums are still skyrocketing what do we know about premiums on the exchanges at this point\nWell actually very interestingly premiums next year for twenty Nineteen are going to go down slightly about one and a half percent the average premium in the states that are run by the the federal government which is most of them\nWhat analysts say is that they would have gone down considerably more if not for some of the changes that the administration has made so the administration is trying to have it both ways like look we made premiums go down and actually\nOther things made premiums go down their actions made premiums mostly go up\nThe other thing we see is a change in polling and perceptions of the Affordable CARE Act back during the campaign plurality of voters said they disapprove of the law now here we are two years later\nAnd the majority not significant but a smaller majority said that they support the Affordable CARE Act so ... how do you explain that\nI I feel like twenty Seventeen in the fight over repealing the law was basically the the marketing plan that the Obama administration never had for the law it taught people what was in it I'm basically a top people what was in it by suggesting what they were going to lose\nA particularly things like protection for pre existing conditions expansions of Medicaid that it helped a lot of middle class people not just poor people that little class people who are\nThe care of their aging parents um their Medicaid has proved to be much more popular than I think Republicans realized um so it was it goes to much more than the laws much larger than just a five percent of people who are in these individual markets buying insurance and I\nThink people actually learned just as it was getting ready to go away that maybe these are things we actually would like to keep around\n[noise] so what happens in twenty Nineteen the Republicans have said if we keep control of Congress we're going to go at it again we're going to take another repeal vote you have Democrats many of them are running this year on something they call Medicare for all\nSaying that they are going to make that a priority should they take control of Congress should really can you help us understand what could really possibly happen including Nineteen\nIt interesting that it's sort of the health debate is by for ... you know where's the Affordable CARE Act was intended to be a middle of the road moderate plan market basic could attract some\nModerate Republicans which in the end they didn't but that was that was the idea now we're seeing sort of both sides going to their corners Republicans\nSaying you know yes we want to get rid of this whole thing and start over with what we don't know Democrats are saying you know maybe this compromise thing didn't work we want to have Medicare for all single payer universal coverage\nCall it what you will but because I think people are frustrated with the state of the healthcare system right now\nEven if premiums are moderating out of pocket expenses are going up people are paying more or they perceive that they are paying more health care is simply too expensive\nAnd they're thinking that yes the Affordable CARE Act was a nice thing but people are still hurting and we need to do something more dramatic so you know what you end up with and are are are these sort of polar opposites and it's hard to see where there could be any middle ground where something could pass at least in the immediate future\nThe discussion about Medicare for all has been very active on the Democratic side the president himself took to USA Today he penned in an op ed\nWhere he argued that this proposal of Medicare for all is going to totally destroy Medicare as we know it for seniors\nAnd that it's basically a form of socialism what do we know about the president's plan for Medicare uh especially since we know that this is a big driver of government spending and there seems to be discussion\nEvery year about its potential\nMoney so where does he seemed to be going with discussions on this\nWell I'm actually surprised that this didn't come up until now Medicare has been a\nA a traditional issues sort of Medicare scare tactics have been traditionally issue for Republicans in midterms um because older people tend to vote in larger numbers in midterms and this goes back to twenty ten when the Republicans were trying to undermine the Affordable CARE Act they were not so much arguing about the the parts of the law that we think of as Obamacare\nThey were arguing about all the money that the Affordable CARE Act cut out of Medicare um ironically in the interim the Republicans when they got into office um said and yeah those Medicare cuts that were in the Affordable CARE Act which were mostly\nCuts to provide her payments for beneficiaries actually got more benefits out of that law but there were reduction in payments to hospitals and doctors and\nFor a variety of other things and the Republicans decided that they were going to keep those cuts because they made sense and because they needed the money\nUh interestingly a President Trump's own budget recommends more cuts to Medicare again mostly the provider payment\nUm but for the president it to then go out and bashed the Democrats for having cut Medicare and the Affordable CARE Act yeah that that doesn't really work for the Republican now the argument that Medicare for all will undermine Medicare is a relatively new and this seems to be the favorite Republican line of attack it's like\nThey will not only make America you know a socialist program they will get rid of Medicare for seniors to um at least on her most of the Medicare for all bills we've seen seniors would get more benefits and have to pay less\nHow the country could afford it is a debate that needs to be had\nBut it's a little bit of an of an odd scare tactic to say that that seniors would lose Medicare if the country went to
