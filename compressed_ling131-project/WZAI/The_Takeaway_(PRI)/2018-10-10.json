city as part of the abandoned in America series that we've been highlighting all week Yahoo city school district\nThe municipal school district there is one of the worst in the state of Mississippi and that's one of the reasons why we decided to go there to talk to the people there to find out how they feel about their education system and to find out what can or is being done about it\nNow you visited four of the districts public schools can you tell us or described for our listeners a little bit about what you saw what were the conditions like so few of the schools\nAre actually in very good shape they are modern there's new tables in the high school cafeteria and those were in good shape the oldest building and used by the district is Webster elementary school and this is for\nChildren who are just starting out this is for pre K. kindergarten and first grade students and the desks were marred from years of use their bathroom was a partially out of order\nThere with peeling paint in the hallways and you could tell that you know it had been re painted and re painted and re painted over and over again this is the facility where the heating system had gone out a couple of years ago and some parents tried to pay to have it fixed tried to help the school district\nAnd um then heating system couldn't keep up last winter and one parent had to go and pick his child up early from school so it's in it's in rough shape and the issue is that they don't have\nTheir there just isn't a tax base there it's it's very low they don't have a lot of income coming in so they don't have resources to pour into this old\nFacility let's talk a little bit about um race and how the demographics of the schools are playing into what you saw down their\nShirt so what I found in my reporting is that in Mississippi this is this happen has happened across the state forty nine of a hundred and forty five school districts\nIn American Nineteen districts are more than three quarters white um so the schools there have re segregated in in a big way and this is particularly true in Yahoo city where in Nineteen Seventy I'm black students entered white schools for the first time and they're\nAfter that period\nWhite students started going to private school or they moved out to ... county and the school district there now is Ninety eight percent black\nAnd if you look across the state of Mississippi none of the districts that are more than three quarters black R rated a or B none of the districts that are more than three quarters white are ready to be or F the gravity of the situation cannot be overstated\nNow is that you mentioned that the tax base but is that really the only reason why the schools are where are you seeing the discrepancies in these

system that that there are differences between the quality of education there is a difference between the quality of education that black students are receiving a quality of education that white students are receiving\nTeacher retention quality of facilities um income plays into all of this\nNow you spoke to the districts new superintendent and the person's name is Georgia Ingram\nWe have

assembled bureau chief for the New York times Carlotta thanks for joining us pleasure to be with you can you remind our listeners who could show he is and why he was being targeted by the Saudi Government\nSo he was one of the most outspoken critics but the most interesting thing for a lot of us who knew him over the years was that he hit\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support WC I at Cape and islands dot org\nTaken out of the post with the Washington Post or the global columnist and moved away from Saudi Arabia and basically set up in self imposed exile in his in his criticism had increased so he was a real so on and the side as we see clearly now with his face\nAnd you've been speaking to sources within the Turkish government car lot of what are the new developments here\nSo we've been following this day by day and drip drip the information has come out of it was clear from the start the that the Turkish officials here were very alarmed and they\nTalked early on of his possible death [noise] um and now we are getting the actual evidence we don't have a his body yet but we've got very from signs from Turkish officials they don't want to come out in public but that clearly giving it\nTo John honest to publish that those two\nGroups of Saturday's that arrived on the day that he attended a meeting at the consulate he never came out from that meeting\nOn October the second over a week ago and these officials that came flew in on private planes and left the same day I'm a ... or Turkish officials Saudi officials Fifteen of them want to separate planes they came in in in a different times that day and they left\nThe same day and the Turkish officials are saying they are essentially a hit squad they were responsible\nFor killing him this memory in his body and somehow disposing of it so the the mystery remains the investigation the tux of now mounted an investigation they're asking access to the consulate which of course is\nDiplomatic parrot trace that said uh also unprecedented but they're taking it very seriously\nThere are some very lurid details in your story in the New York times can you tell us a little bit about what we know so far about how ... was killed if that's in fact what happened\nThe details all gruesome as one official told my colleague David Kirkpatrick that it's something like pulp fiction and that they even arrived with a bone saw among their equipment we know they took several books\nThe embassy or consulate building putting them in biblical [noise] um we know they traveled with luggage on that private planes so it's coming out slowly but there's some very alarming details um those even one team to do the job of killing him and another team to clean up the premises off to it\nNow what do we know about how the United states has reacted if at all and the United states obviously has close ties to the Saudis um has there been any anything from the U.S so far\nSo at first it was a bit muted I think perhaps for everyone nobody was quite sure what had happened was this a case of a disappearance or really foul play and the talks I think have been keen to get international support on this because\nI'm everyone knows Saudi Arabia is a very\nPowerful and rich nation especially in the Muslim world on so everybody has been looking certainly from here from looking from Istanbul where where I'm based has been looking to the American reaction and we saw a couple of comments from President Trump but also from vice president Pence and I think\nImportantly a more and more comments coming out of from congressman and senator so the American I think sided waking up and taking this more seriously as the information is coming out and it's becoming more and more clear what happened\nThis is a moment in which the United states has made you know at least the president has pulls no punches in his day and I think for many I'm In the press and not\nAttack on press freedoms has actually I think extended worldwide we've seen a number of journalists killed in Mexico we've seen a number of journalists killed in the ear you recently how do we know who we can trust with these stories Carlotta are there\nAny of the actors involved in this cause Yogi story that you feel are telling the truth or not telling the truth um it just feels really difficult with these types of pieces to understand where to look\n[noise] um it it is difficult and not least in Turkey well known or any you know the president of of the usa criticized John us but the president of turkey often criticized as journalists including foreign journalists let me working here um but this is a completely different league from you know complaining about the\nPress or banning pressed from working or even share as journalists I'll put in prison [noise] this is altogether different league because it's\nThis too is clearly a disliked by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his criticism but to dispose of him breaking international law\nI'm In another country\nAlso be disposing or him in the country or take him out of the country it was\nIt's completely I'm a different league of of what we have seen ... coming from the U.S president them on the touch for them so it's also a British shocked to hear both in government on in society I think the government ... because\nThey knew ... well he was he counted among his friends people who are senior advisors and the government um he had a great reputation because he'd been reporting for such he is on Middle East and Muslim effect as an so he was\nHe was well known and well respected an for him to end up like this is a pool into a country that considered him a Muslim brother new pride
