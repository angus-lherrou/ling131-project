station\n[noise]\nUm [noise] um [noise]\nAcross six states thousands of teachers participated in strikes or walkouts this year demanding higher pay and calling attention to years of state budget cuts to education funding the strikes have become one of the most defining protest movements of the year the schools have\nNot seen the same kind of boon that the economies have a and I think teachers saw that and we're getting really really frustrated\nThat's Mariah billing get national education reporter for the Washington Post I spoke with her about why teachers' strikes began and how they were affecting the midterms\nWell I think there's a few things at play I Do think that conditions in the schools um in some places that leads to get worse because now we're not only talking about teacher pay but states are facing huge revenue problems um as a result of tumbling oil prices and also because of tax cuts\nAnd some states have not even recovered since the recession even though their economies have I think also sort of the general energy in the country is that of activism and there's also a lot of frustration about education secretary Betsy the boss and the fact that she was appointed\nRepublican teachers even teachers who support Trump are very frustrated with her appointment [noise]\nIn looking at places like Arizona and Oklahoma in West Virginia did the teacher activism what impact did that have on ways in which teachers were funded themselves and the schools were funded\nSo in West Virginia they did succeed in getting a raise as they did in Oklahoma I'm In Oklahoma what was really extraordinary is the teachers to access silly press the legislatures into\nStreet which is incredible in Arizona I'm the governor there Doug do see has pledged twenty per cent raise by twenty twenty but there's a lot of skepticism that he can actually make that happen because he's relying on some pretty rosy revenue projections and he's holding to a pledge to never raise taxes\nSo is your expectation then that these fights are just beginning rather than that these marches marked an end to something or they actually a beginning\nI think we're seeing actually a transformation of the energy we've seen teachers run for office teachers got politically involved in other ways teachers throw their weight behind long shot candidates like Richard ... in West Virginia\nWho was one of the first lawmakers to stand up on behalf of teachers in the state I've talked to teachers who are\nDeeply familiar with state policy now and they never were politically active before certainly people I've spoken to said that they've seen a huge increase in the number of teachers who have run and not only that but lawmakers that stood against teachers are crossed teacher unions seem to be getting punished in Oklahoma for example\nSomething like a half dozen state lawmakers who were incumbents were ousted in the primaries the same happened in West Virginia so you're seeing a lot of states teachers are are really flexing their muscles and a lot of different ways\nAre you noticing that voters have different perceptions of teachers and their expectations for what teachers should get paid and how they should be treated than voters have been seeing teachers in previous times\nI think two things I'm I've talked to grassroots organizations in Arizona and and Oklahoma\nWho are sort of creating these pro education slates and so\nIt's not really about whether the candidate as a Republican or a Democrat it's about uh where do they stand on raising funding for schools in Arizona something like forty percent of voters said that education was one of their top if not the top issue for them\nThe same thing in Colorado it's a huge issue\nI'm In Kansas to sort of indirectly the election has become sort of a referendum on whether Governor Brown backs tax cuts were a successor disaster\nSo I think there is I don't know if it's a changing perception of teachers but everybody has a visceral connection to education and I think the plight of educator\nI'm rightfully so because in a lot of places they're facing some pretty severe challenges\n[noise] so do you think we're in a new phase then of activism around the issue of education and teachers that were going to see beyond the ... election\nI Believe so even before the teachers' strikes or even as they were starting Republican governors started to recognize that that they needed to burnish their credentials on education and they started\nCampaigning on how well the refunding education it's no longer necessarily about tax cuts and responsible spending governor Doug juicy has campaigned on being the education governor\nSo Scott Walker Scott Walker who famously guided the power of a public sector unions and also cut school funding has been advertising the fact that he put a lot more money into schools during his tenure and Scott Walker of course running against\nThe state superintendent of schools and I assume then that education is playing it very significant role in the Wisconsin governor's race\nYes it's playing a huge role um and I believe it's it may be one thing that is making that democratic candidate competitive\nIs the fact that he is the superintendent of education so I think this was going to happen anyhow but I think there is this a recognition that schools are really important to people and that they don't want to see them and destitute condition Mariah thank you for joining us yes thank you\n... is a national education reporter for the Washington Post

Missouri rally last month and I'm In the midst of Brett Kavanaugh and I talked to many women because I was just curious to get their take and take their temperature on it\nMany women felt like they couldn't really talk about the reasons why they wanted Kavanaugh confirmed the reasons why they thought Republicans we're actually moving too slowly because they are in their minds they're used to being jumped on an attack for voicing and opinion so in in ironically enough it's sort of like a safe space for a lot of these people\nYou can think that's wrong or I think that's right based on your own political beliefs but they have gathered there because they have somebody on stage who is reflecting the frustration they feel\nA back to them and crowd and host sort of leave these events with another fix like to go forward with the energy to keep feeling like political outsiders\nThat's what I was gonna ask you is do you think that people who show up to the Israelis see themselves as political activists I\nThink increasingly so I think um one one important component of these rallies which it's not talked about a lot because it's not really a sexy topic but the campaign looks at these events as data mining expedition so they go and\nThey have a pretty um you know they have a digital sign up process so to get a ticket which they're free but you give over your your cell phone information on that campaign can learn a lot about you just just based on your sign up to attend the rally they want to build 'em\nYou know sophisticated sort of kiosk check in systems in the future when you buy merchandise you turn over your driver's license which is common and a lot of sort of\nA political settings to turn over you know information like that\nBut I'm the campaign is using that to sort of spur future activism to keep in touch with these people to get them face to face with other people in their neighborhoods so they can leave these rallies and go home and ... knock or make phone calls or get involved at their local GOP headquarters um there's a whole other\nBackbone to these rallies beyond the political theater where the campaign is working really hard to harness voter information spur activism and also raise a lot of money you see that the campaign has just raise another huge amount of funds I think is a hundred million\nThese events are are not just um an opportunity for the president to areas grievances um it's an opportunity for people to to go back home and get involved\n[noise] yeah because you know we're we're looking at the activism on the other side right you see the women's marches and the other protests to Donald Trump and I\nWas wondering if the people who attend these Trump rallies see themselves doing that same sort of political activism right if people are taking to the streets against the president I'm going to show up to a rally\nAs a way to show my political a viewpoint\nYeah people definitely voice that as a as a reason for why they support Donald Trump at all a lot of his supporters are\nOlder white people who have voted in elections before and they have told me you know dozens of them I guess a after attending a lot of these rallies that they had not really been involved\nOr you know they they were quiet during the Obama years and then in Trump they found a candidate that where they felt like they could get out and get behind and I think that\nPeople very much see themselves as a part of his you know I don't want to use this word but the campaign uses the word as part of his army of of supporters and the campaign is very clear about wanting to build what they have called sort of an army of volunteers um there's a lot of that are wrapped up in in supporter identity I think\nAnd is your sense too that these voters are going to be active in the midterm campaigns I Know the president the other day I'm In an A. P. interviews said well I don't know I hear from some of my supporters because I'm not on the ballot they may not show up\nWhat's your sense well I mean about a month and a half\nAgo I mean I think right before Kavanaugh sort of exploded you know people in the White House we're looking at data from\nA Republican pollsters that said exactly that that the president was going to have a turnout problem because he wasn't on the ... the ballot but what I Do think has happened is I think prospective voters have been mobilized by the the cabin are confirmation um there's like a\nThere's a thought that the performance on behalf of the Democrats has almost been looked at as a political gift by Republicans in the White House Republicans close to the president Republican pollsters\nWho said you know the president has not performed as well to mobilize moderate voters but the Democrats have sort of given us this political gift of being able to call them a mob and that's really changed the tenor head of the midterms\nThere's a sense that it's still there game have you noticed as we get closer to the election that his his scripted sounds a little bit different than it did earlier this year\nYeah he's done something that's kind of new in the past month or so which is her son to fight the midterms by saying you're voting for me\nI'm I'm On the ballot and you think of me is on the ballot you're voting for me and don't let me down and if you pay attention to the local Republican candidates in these areas um they go on you know before\nThe president does or you know briefly during the president's appearance saying you know basically the same thing to that effect you know if we you know the president will suffer the president full will suffer if you don't come out and vote\nWith the campaign is banking on is that these people are going to come home and talk to their neighbors knock on doors start little volunteer groups and and spur in sort of animate activity right before the midterm kitty\nThank you for coming in and joining us thank you for having me Katie Rogers is a White House correspondent for the New York times [noise]\nThe takeaway is supported by timeshare exit team founded\nOn the belief that valid contracts must have a reasonable term exit options that timeshare exit team dot com and babble\nA language that teaches real live conversations in a new language like Spanish French or German battles ten to Fifteen minute lessons are available in the ... or online ad babble B a B B.
