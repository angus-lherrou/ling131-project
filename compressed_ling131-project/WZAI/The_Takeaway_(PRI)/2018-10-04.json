pay a significant share in taxes I Would be willing to pay more taxes that would provide health care for everybody in the United states way much taxes\nTo the top two little not too much\nThey're paying their fair share according to a Gallup survey from last year the top frustration with the American tax system is that corporations and the wealthy don't\nI don't think a lot of millionaires and billionaires pay what they should I don't think the people who make more than the pay their fair share they can actually should be exponential nobody making as much as the top two percent has any need for that much accumulated wealthy people who need the money to pay the most in\nTax what gets me the most is that the wealthy people we hear about don't care to pay their fair share I'm Sorry to point out the current president as an example but he is a notorious taxi later\nPresident Donald Trump family is the subject of a New York times investigation revealing that of the one billion dollars in wealth Fred Trump transferred to his children\nThe trumps paid just five percent tax on that money instead of the fifty five percent tax rate that was in place at the time but the trumps the only one skirting the tax laws according to the latest data from the Internal Revenue service the tax that is an estimated four hundred and fifty eight\nBillion dollars that means that between the years two thousand and eight and two thousand and ten that was the average annual difference between what Americans pay in taxes and what they actually oh again for the people in the back over\nFour hundred and

by Trump country working\nBut with all the focus on white rural voters who turned out for Donald Trump another important group of constituents is usually ignored\nThere are black people living outside of city living mostly in the house and living in red states right so the black belt overlaps with Trump country and those are the folks that are really going to factor into elections across the south in these midterm elections\nThat Aaron Haynes whack and she's the Associated Press national writer on race and ethnicity and recently she's been reporting from rural counties in Georgia and part of what's called the black belt\nThe black belt is that what we know is the deep south which you know historically is where slavery thrived uh where you know the wealth of the plantation system was created and obviously when slavery went away these became some of the most impoverished areas in the country\nBut the black belt is also where frankly the battle for voting rights for African Americans was was waged and so you know you think about Fannie Lou Hamer Ella Jo Baker Fred Shuttlesworth John Lewis these people weren't from Baltimore Cleveland or New York you know they were\nDid that franchise for all and you know this is also the place where\nIssues like voter suppression continuing persist today and so that's one of the reasons why it's really important to focus on these folks and how they're going to factor into November and you mentioned voter suppression um tell us a little bit about some of the other issues that are\nReally top of mind for black working class rural Americans\nBecause a lot of these areas are poor they struggle with economic development opportunities a lot more than than urban areas but they also have healthcare challenges specifically\nAs we know minorities often have health care disparities from diabetes to sickle cell obesity\nBut they don't necessarily have the access to health care that you would have\nSay in a city you can have dozens and dozens of churches for example but no hospitals for miles and miles and that's a real challenge for them and something\nSomething that has has not been addressed frankly by by the folks that that get elected and those parts of the country a lot of times\nAnd in your piece you went to Georgia to report this out why did you choose that state\nWhat's yours was really really important because\nIn Georgia there is obviously a very high profile gubernatorial contest where possibly be first African American woman\nCould be elected governor in the country and that Stacey Abrams\nAnd Stacey Abrams actually started her campaign in South Georgia where a lot of these black rural voters lists and the reason that that's important is because you know about a third of the rural folks in Georgia are people of color\nAnd so unlike other contest local contests for example that may be\nDilute the power of people of color frankly because of of racial gerrymandering you know in a statewide contest these are the voters that can really be key to to those kinds of victories and frankly you know what she has done going to a lot of these places that have been forgotten\nYou know by Democrats in recent cycles could make the difference in that in that contest and others in in the south where you have\nA large populations of black folks especially in rural counties Aaron one thing that comes across in your piece is that the black rural populations that you spoke to felt disaffected by politics that seems to be shifting and I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about that\nWell one thing that's important to think about for these\nThey felt like they they they were electing people who were forgetting about them kind of in between election times you know they they were they were\nVoting for people who then did not come back and give them like I said the economic development that they were looking for or the health care\nThat they need and so they felt like at least in these off presidential year elections that their vote didn't count\nYou know you've got now folks who look like they're running in more of these places are in in in several of these counties that I went to you have incumbents who've been in office for years in some cases even white conservative lawmakers at the local level\nRepresenting majority black counties and and I wondered you know how that possible well these people have gone on challenge\nFor so long or people you know have not paid attention to those local level elections and so these people have stayed in office but but now that starting to change if folks are starting to get more engaged in these local uh down ballot races and realizing that that they can also make a difference\nRight and and what's interesting also is that I interviewed therapists marsh is a journalist and a couple of weeks ago and she was talking about how white progressive rural voters\nFeel that their perspectives have been forgotten in the Trump country narrative freight did rural black voters also feel like they were being left out of the media narrative or was that just something\nThat wasn't even a concern for them\nNo I think it definitely is a concern because you know I brought this up to them you know doing my reporting it now a lot of them not at their heads in agreement I you know they're not front of mind when you think about rural voters or even farmers I mean black people there's never been a time in this country when black people have not been connected to the land\nAnd so the idea that somehow we have been distance from that narrative is is really interesting to me I mean I'm from the south and so obviously for me that's not something that foreign but but for a lot of folks that that are in cities and maybe you know either don't have relatives are aren't getting back\nTo to that part of the country to see family or friends it doesn't always a a car to folks that yes there are black people living in rural areas and and quite a lot of them frankly\nI'm curious if you think there could be the potential for coalitions to be formed between the more progressive white rural voters and rural black voters who might be able to see some opportunities there for cross pollination if you will of ideas or is ...\nWell you know I think it's entirely possible and I say that because again when you're in a small place like that you know these are folks that are interacting\nSo much I mean not to suggest that there are still places like that where there there is segregation of people are living in different parts of town but the town is so much smaller than say a big city and so these are folks that really do know each other\nYou know I I think of a recent campaign stop this day the agents had down in plains Georgia\nWhich is the hometown of former President Jimmy Carter\nAnd you know the idea that the two of them would be on the campaign trail together President Carter has endorsed her they're talking about rural healthcare\nThat's something that affects both those progressive white rural voters and black rural voters and so you know understanding that they do have shared interests I I think does prevent an opportunity for just that kind of coalition that you talk about\n[noise] Aaron ... the Associated Press national writer on race and ethnicity Aaron thanks for joining us

immigrant\nWomen especially those who are undocumented things can be even more complicated in fact immigrant women are nearly twice as likely as the general population to experience domestic violence\nThese women may not be aware of the legal options available to them or those options themselves may be limited many of them say they fear deportation if they contact\nOver the last several decades the secretive network of like the nuts has sprung up in California to help those suffering from domestic abuse women who actually opened their homes at\nThe press there is a contributing writer for California Sunday magazine and she reported on this underground network of women giving abused immigrants safety opinion chips and even medical and legal advice\nPresser says there are about one hundred and fifty other let the women nationwide doing work similar to what she saw in California and she told me about one of the woman she followed in her reporting so I thought women and Valentino and she's opening her home in one of the women who who she's working with as a woman who I call Sylvia um she has been in an abusive\nRelationship for many years and for a while\nShe was struggling to leave because she was nervous about\nThis going public with her story at all since Trump was elected she became much more nervous about the threat of deportation and in particular about losing her children and so\nShe came to Valentino his house and stayed for a week and now Valentino sees her regularly to check in on her and she understands that this is a long process right now the average an average woman tries seven times to leave her obese a partner in this country when you are a number of women that can be even more difficult\nWhat is a you visa and how does it play into this conversation where\nI'll step back a little bit of violence against women act was first passed in Nineteen Ninety four and it was the first federal legislative package that was designed to end violence against women and it included a piece of legislation that\nProvided a path to permanent residency for abuse immigrant women whose spouses where\nTheir abusers and who are also us at a center permanent residents the really small fraction of African women in two thousand and with the reauthorization of the violence against women act that was expanded in the ... that was created and offered a path to permanent residency for immigrant women who were victims of violent crime and who were willing to\nHelp with the investigation and prosecution of that crowd and it was bipartisan legislation so that ... is that where does it stand today in the past four years have seen an enormous backlog grow in twenty four team the government was granting visas to women who had applied five months earlier if you apply today you will wait nine years for a visa\nThere isn't a hundred and twenty thousand person backlog so they're kept at ten thousand a year\nUm and the same time frame you've seen the number of a Jew Decatur has dropped from Ninety three to sixty at the last official tally why is there such a delay and is that delay what spring\nThese women in part to seek services quote unquote underground\nHard to understand why there's such a delay and why there hasn't been a surplus or an addition\nThe process it's a good question about whether that delays driving people under God of course we don't know causation necessarily but definitely the woman who I was speaking to her opening their homes were finding that\nSurvivors who came to them just didn't want to wait nine years they couldn't wait nine years right\nSo that means that for nine years they don't have the protection of a work permit said they can't necessarily support their children and that's what the you know it was designed to do to to give people a pathway to residency so that they would be able to leave safely and to support their families\nAnd you know the Obama administration um how do you know had very controversial policies regarding immigration I'm Wondering are these would have been more concerned under today's circumstances under the Trump Administration or is there equal concern under the Obama administration is so what's the difference\nToday I was wondering the same thing and I was actually I'm somewhat surprised to learn that this concern is much much higher today than it was under Obama's administration the concern of ... and the concern of the concern of deportation a lot of the women who were\nComing to the safe house is essentially under the Obama administration\nDidn't feel as if it was as risky to come forward to the police they felt as if Obama's deportation priorities were much clear and now those priorities have been widened so broadly that they really just don't know\nOne of the other things I heard a lot in this reporting was that women felt particularly afraid about separation of families it's just all over the news in this way that they believe that it's possible that their family too could be separated\nWhen these women come to volunteer or do they ended up staying just temporarily do they end up going back to their abusive partners like what have you seen\nYeah so ... estimates that about half of the women who have stayed with her have gone back to their partners it's really really difficult police\nAnd a half have left some stay for a night some stay for two months so it really depends on the woman and Valentino is feeling is it's up to them and she'll do what what works best for them I mean I've met I met some women who are opening their homes who found that the survivors stayed with them for as long as the year\nOne of the problems at the shelter system is that there's an expiration date um if you are if you are lucky enough to find a bed in a shelter which is extremely hard to do\nYou often have sixty or Ninety Days maximum and then you have to get out and so these them and feel like the least they can do is kind of extend that stay why does the network need to\nYou don't have to call it a secret and would actually speak about it more publicly others feel as if it's too risky to say I'm bringing in women whose partners are abusing them because they feel as if there's a possibility that if you will ...\nCome after them some of them have kids that are living with you know and they're trying to protect their families and they're trying to protect their communities and in part because the survivors themselves want\nTo disappear they feel as if if they can't get a restraining order I don't feel safe going to the police they can't get a restraining order they don't want to live in the same city did their abusers they prefer to move to a different town and start a new life\nAnd so they would prefer if their location was secret until the women who are opening their homes respect and honor that is there anything we should be thinking about culturally because we're talking about Latinos in particular are there\nAny uh cultural distinctions that come up and dealing with domestic violence there's so much work that needs to be done at the ground level just to get women to feel comfortable talking among people who they know\nAbout what's going on in their home or what's going on in the workplace\nAnd we can't be failing to see that can't be missing [noise]\nLizzy presser is a contributing writer for
