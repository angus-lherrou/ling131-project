GBH radio in Boston [noise] on Sunday\nVoters in Brazil the world's fourth largest democracy will head to the polls for a final run off vote in the country's presidential election there'll be choosing between far right candidate shy or most of the NATO and Fernando adopt a former mayor of Sao paolo running for the Workers Party also known as the P. T.\nThe races attracting international attention in large part because of ... extreme views on torture homosexuality and state sponsored violence if successful Brazil would be the latest country swept up in a wave of populist leaders\nAnd for Brazilians this fall a title election comes after years of economic instability and political turbulence\nWholly unfair to the Brazilian writer and he joined me from Sao paolo to trace the roots of the upcoming election\nThe first moments where you can find ... would be two thousand protein when many people to to the streets to protest the government's\nAt first it was a left wing progress as we tended to have here in Brazil and then in the meantime let's go to the first one the second one it when it got bigger and bigger [noise] it was a similar to this is a a right wing\nMovement and then from then on the started organizing them so they went to the streets are against it\nAsking for do my roof says beach mints and then after a while they got that\nAnd well all this structure that was against the tea now is supporting John you both so now do this stream right politician and things got really ugly in that point\nWhy do you think in ... this extreme to the point where last see not only um could potentially be elected well\nUh I think it has something of a sudden character\nBecause well I don't believe that we have a fifty percent of a population tend to fire writes thoughts I mean it just to be ten percent tops every last election and less Thirty years but then there was so much rage and so much hatred\nAnd there was also a media campaign against the tea and focusing lost in the corruption scandals that are serious obviously\nBut they weren't only beat the fall and then people this rage and hatred became a support for this terrible character this terrible guy\nThat people tend not to see all they see and maybe they don't want to have the exact conscience of while they are actually supporting\n[noise] he's mostly not exploiting on any of the conditions that exist to social divisions that exist in Brazil right now\nWell definitely mainly the middle class in satisfaction\nBecause well er during the the workers' party governments during the Thirteen years they were in power there was significant growth for the poorest but middle class the state more or less the same\nSo they were after awhile closer to the poorest than to the reaches [noise] and this created some sort of this stuff this faction through a great part of of a population\nAnd now I think both so NATO is exploiting exactly that and pass the support of these people even though his his policies won't do anything good for them they tend to do a lot well\nFor the reaches not for the middle class\nAnd I want to read an accent\nTo to tell us a little bit about it in in your essay you said quote it Brazil were not drowning under so much rage so much hatred so much yelling if there were just a single moment of silence perhaps everybody would be able to hear the alarm bells sounding something is in danger\nIn many ways putting on these shows a lot like the moment in the United states that were living right now are you concerned about what you see is what's happening in Brazil and also what's happening across the world\nYeah definitely it's a great a reason for concern\nAnd well perhaps we are now in the frontline of something a lot bigger I'd like to consider it a backlash of many other advances\nWe've had in this last decades and Brazil this seems to be the case at least because there was this a progressive governments for ... years and then you have this reaction that very conservative and besides the reactionary\nIn Brazil we don't have a strong democracy as you have been in the United states it's been only Thirty years of democracy at this point since the less dictatorship\nAnd you never know when the military will get in the way again we'll start gaining power and becoming something else so it's a great reason for concern definitely\nAnd in terms of those in Brazil and Brazilian society who would be most vulnerable under a boss to narrow presidency\nWell first of all definitely the poorest because he has a very\nViolent program for fighting crying organized crime and without considering the risks of that\nThan arming great spots of the population than giving license for policemen to kill without any serious investigation so we know that in in the ... we'll see a lot more blood then we see now\nWhich is very serious and of course there will be also persecution of the ... community because he's been talking about that to the entire career\nWomen will suffer because well he he tends to be against policies of the quality the indigenous community as well he doesn't want to preserve the land\nAnd the original black communities is\nThe most vulnerable will suffer more\nAnd we don't know if that will be something similar to what we said during the dictatorship that was ... than the activists\nHe has said things that's going to that idea but we are not sure how he was planning to do that or if he's planning to do that at this point is just a vague manner and well not if people

the sense this idea of ownership and land ownership and the relationship that cultures have to the land in as people who have who are of African native dissent\nHaving this relationship and report the land\nAnd the ownership of the land in this you know sort of European system of what it means to own land well we're here so if we're going to participate we might as well be owners as well that was an important sort of subplot in the story that when your mixed in with feminism colors and class there's a lot\nThere did you learn anything about your dad that you didn't now I didn't have a sense of through this film well you know\nMy parents split when I was young and\nHe moved on to another relationship the the woman that he was in a relationship with before he died\nShe's from the region and she you know worked on the film and had a hand in sort of clue and him into the world and why it's interesting and important but inside of the romance in the film I had a sense of what it might have been like for my parents\nYou know what that courtship might've been like because it was just something very\nI don't want to say simple but something so tender about the way the characters interact that it's it's very genuine and you can't really\nYou can't make that up it would be super corny you know I mean someone said recently who saw the film that it it has a very eighties vibe\nWhy does that mean well I was a kid in the eighties so what does that well you'll if you're a kid from the eighties you will love the uh parents have designer jeans every ones were rocking designer jeans everyone's but male and female looks great\nThere's a photo Matt you know I don't know for those who are old enough to ... days we used to have to take film right actually get a developed right at a little hot that was usually stationed in a parking lot it was a photo Matt\nYou know so the pacing you know there's an eighties pacing maybe like if you watch sixty minutes from Nineteen Seventy five it's like it's really hard you know it's it's really slow the pacing everything so quick now [noise] but\nIs in the spirit of the story he wanted to tell he was a documentary filmmaker so there are long scenes music is a very important part of the film and it was funny the editor was telling the story of how\nMy father would make everyone listened to the soundtrack and he made me listen to it too that's the one thing that I always remembered but in some instances the music plays out in a way that it's almost like a music video which to me like almost like a long long for music video which in a in an interesting way it was kind of ahead of its time or\nSort of merging with the emergence of music videos and I learned from someone that he was inspired by super fly for instance that that had like a amazing soundtrack and he wanted the soundtrack to almost be a character in the film and that's definitely the way it is\nDo you think that when you look at black film today in twenty eight ...\nDo you think that there is enough nuance I'm black everyday life in those films similar to the way that your dad was able to bring that to like 'cause I think that is one of the most compelling things that you're talking about is just how nuanced and how delicate these portrayals word do you see the filmmakers are getting better at that\nWell I think Hollywood is recognizing that there's money in this audience and people of color have more than one way to beat and there's nothing wrong with not having a broad world view but Hollywood television in particular likes to put people in boxes by marketing money\nOkay this very specific group of black people like these hair care products you can sell stuff to people I get it but I think the sort of box that that same litter you no pun intended black box that we've often been put in it's too small it doesn't fit anymore and um\nYou look at you know my man child is can be no you know you look at this sort of new wave of\nOkay here are some other black people to who have stories to tell who are great and so I have hope that things are changing but you know change never comes as quickly as you'd like\nYou're also a filmmaker are there any projects um that you're working on coming out\nWorking on a four part film about the Wu Tang clan there twenty fifth anniversary this year and um to really understand Wu Tang clan I mean you can listen to their music and enjoyed it sounds great but like\nTo really peel back the lyrics is to have a real understanding of who they are and where they come from and as I tell people all the time to understand hip hop or blues jazz you know all these art forms or reflection of in a reaction to the environment and so to tell the story you've got to understand the virus\nWho they are and so to me the music is the cherry on top it's all the other stuff the environment the social climate all the things that they had to overcome that really make their story compelling\nIs there anything that you're taking away from your dad's filmmaking process and incorporating it into the work that you do\nWell saying something every time I have the opportunity to make a film\nI say something you know I did a film called fresh stressed about the history of hip hop passion and you you learn about a Sunday Best and most people you say Sunday Best and they think it means we're nice suit but they don't realize it means in certain states it was mandated by their slaves and nice\nOutfit so they can go to church worship God it's white or supposedly white there aren't a lot of people looked like me who have the opportunity to say things and so I like to entertain people but I think it's also important to say something so every film I Do and my father would definitely feel very strongly about
