energy setting off a massive oil spill on the coast of Louisiana that's been growing steadily for fourteen years every day the site assistance viewing between three hundred to seven hundred barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico\nTaylor Energy has cleaned up some of the mass but they've also been suing the government to avoid a full clean up on the site and if the spill is not stop soon it's on track to become one of the worst in us history\nMichael ... is a reporter with the Associated Press and he's been reporting on the Taylor oil spill for years Michael thanks for joining us\nBill started in two thousand and four and it's now back in the news because the Justice Department had an independent analysis about this tell us about that what did they find\nWell they found that the weak appears to be a much worse than either the company or the government itself has been saying for many years the latest estimates which were put together by independent researcher from Florida found that between ten thousand thirty thousand gallons of oil is leaking daily\nFrom multiple wells around that platform that toppled over during hurricane Ivan in two thousand four\nAnd the reason why this is an issue now after all these many years is that Taylor Energy a company based in New Orleans that doesn't have any assets anymore essentially only exist to fight this bill is trying to recover hundreds of millions of dollars that it set aside years ago to try to end this leak they want the money back\nThe government says no you need to do more to finish what you started here down below the surface of the Gulf\nObviously there's a money issue here but what is it about this film that why is it taking so long for this to stop this looks like it's an environmental disaster that's been going on in our own backyard\nWell hadn't gotten a lot of attention until recently that ... that's true the company's position is that basically look this is not any different than the natural seeps that occur out there out in the Gulf of Mexico that are harmless\nThat's their position is are they right about that though while I mean that's a I think that's open to debate certainly and um uh the government's position is very different that that does pose a potential threat to the environment and that they have to go out there and do it they can the problem is is that when that hurricane rolled through and knocked over\nThe uh drilling platform it also buried the underground wells under mountains of a settlement that they cannot go in simply dredge without risking somebody's life that's the company with the company says now the company did kill some of the wealth they said but\nThey said there's nothing more can be done without causing tensions in greater risk if they go in there and they\nTake the settlement away could make leak even worse possibly so there's some there's very little degree and it seems like between the government and the company about what needs to be done next but the government believes that something can be done and they I Believe are going to order the company to do something else on their below the surface\nI'm just wondering the Taylor oil spill is back in the news but its rivaling this BP oil spill in twenty ten I Can't forget the images of the BP oil spill anywhere lake on loop and I'm Wondering how this is affecting the environment differently than the BP oil spill did in Wilton\n... we all remember we were kind of transfixed by the images of this building\nOut of the bottom of the sea floor if it was coming out all at once you know over the period of grad I Believe three months or so but\nThat massive amount of oil came out ... as you know oil birds on the seashore and it created an environmental catastrophe and in this case this has been a slow motion environmental problem with a tailor energy it's it's seeped out slowly and\nI'm not a scientist but I've been told that the damage in effect is far less serious when it's staggered out in the oil can be ...\nBy waves and water and it doesn't have quite the same impact also the company has said that there is no evidence\nThat this oil from the ... is reaching shores about twelve miles off the coast of Louisiana and these slicks stretch for miles every day or almost every day but\nDon't flex also have an impact on the environment whether we can feed them or not I mean who's supposed to make sure that this is an environmentally sound place again I Believe that\nThere are some a disagreement about this between the two sides of the company has its own experts who say that there is no environmental ecological risk or danger or damage and then the government says\nDifferently that there's at least the potential for damage to the ecology out there even if it's not oil and birds on the shore and you know there's fish there's other marine life out there that could be affected by these persistent and chronic leaks\nSo we know the Taylor Energy is suing the federal government what else are they dealing we understand that one of the former owners we do is a prominent philanthropist in Louisiana\nYeah so the Taylor name or his best known probably in Louisiana for a program called tops the tea and pops which has financed free college tuition for many families over the years that this is a couple [noise]\nEnough kids have their own invested a lot of money in um helping other people millions of dollars in Flint or be work Mrs Taylor or his widow is also a very influential political figure donor too many congressmen and senators and she had hired\nLawyers or to lobby on Capitol Hill to try to get the company a break so it's still a of a fight that's ongoing both in court and also a separately the company I tried to petition the somewhat obscure government agency\nTo give it a relief from this a long standing orders that it had to do more\nDown below the sea floor in terms of drilling a intervention wealth to try to kill underground well so there's two fronts but primarily it's just become a case about money and about how much more than you spend or have available to spend down below the surface\n[noise] make all kinds of minutes a reporter and with the Associated Press Michael thanks for joining us\nNothing for having me\nWe reached out to scientists working around the Gulf about the Taylor oil spill bird and ask for a marine geologist at the University of southern Missouri told us that he thinks Taylor Energy should not have to clean up the site\nBut instead they should fund scientific research to study the leak there about twenty oil blowout and federal and state waters every year professor asked for a scientist can use the Taylor oil spill to examine the impact of the oil how the sea floor community response to it\nHow it interacts with plankton and how oil is transported from the surface floor\nProfessor asked for also that some scientists have requested intentional releases of oil basically creating a spill in the Gulf to study these effects\nThe Taylor Site could be a good compromise\nWhat do you think about solutions like this join the conversation on our Facebook page or tweet us at the ...
