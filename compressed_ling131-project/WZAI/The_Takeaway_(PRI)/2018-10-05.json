Americans make up half the prison population in Maryland it's Seventy two percent black\nRecognizing these problems in the enormous price tag associated with them once popular tough on crime programs

allowed first degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison one was Willie Horton\nA boy and a robbery stabbing him Nineteen to [noise]\nBut today activist and politicians from both sides of the aisle are recognizing the drastic harm those policies cause\nAnd are working to undo them\nInto my ... the director of the Brennan Center for justice program and she explains the evolution we've seen in the last few decades when it comes to criminal justice reform\nIssue of macro cursor ration I think started back in the sixties and seventies and particularly got very bad in the eighties and nineties when crime basically became a politicized issue so at that time there was an increase in crime particularly in cities and politicians responded to that\nNot only campaigning on it but then in acting extremely harsh criminal laws that weren't necessary to bring down crime it so we\nPassing things like three strikes are outlaws turning a misdemeanors into felonies abolishing parole and then you had the war on drugs that thought punished the youth and sale of drugs extremely harshly so between Nineteen Seventy four and two thousand the prison population quadrupled\nThis wasn't just one party that was using this rhetoric are campaigning on these issues can you talk to us a little bit about how Democrats and Republicans talked about crime during this era and how they talk about crime now\nBoth parties Democrats and Republicans were very much campaigning on being tough on crime and you saw this with um George Bush you also saw this with Bill Clinton where they really did make being tough on crime\nOn a campaign issue and they were competing for who could be the most tough on crime what's really interesting is that now the dynamics of this is really different so starting in about two thousand eight\nAround um the recession states we're going through a budget crisis and Republicans started really leading efforts in states to reduce the prison population and Democrats actually joined them after that\nThen you saw in about twenty sixteen so in that election where you thought every single politician running for president except for Donald Trump coming out strongly in support of criminal justice reform so at that point it seemed like there was a political consensus going in the opposite direction than had been going for so many decades\nThe difference between sentencing reform and policing reform it seems there that we do have a pretty big Gulf at least whether it's on public opinion or politically about how policing\nIs performed versus the sentencing for people who've already been arrested and their life after they leave prison\nWe talk about criminal justice reform I think generally people are talking about\nThe idea of reducing the prison population and that can be done in many different ways that can be done in reducing the number of people we arrested that can be done by reducing Simon Says it can be done by releasing people into parole and so there are many different ways\nTo attack that problem the Gulf you're pointing out there is a strong by parts\nAnd says around reducing sentences that seems to be something that people can understand that for example so there is a movement in Congress right now it's actually led by Dick Durbin and Chuck Grassley two were Jews sentences and this is something that\nHas been supported by the president and is supported by politicians on both sides\nSo that seems to be slightly less controversial than this idea of policing reform and can you have meaningful sentencing reform criminal justice reform with out having policing reform I think you need policing reform up\nBut I Do think you can take significant step simply through sentencing and I'm so for example we actually just came out with a report that showed that about forty percent of prisoners are in prison without a justifiable public safety reason\nAnd that through sentencing reform alone you could cut the prison population by that amount\nAnd feel they're a state or states that have made some significant reforms in recent years\nYes so there are many states so last year alone there were Nineteen states that past fifty seven pieces of bipartisan legislation to reduce their prison population and one example that people frequently uses the example of Texas\nBecause that was something where they did a lot of comprehensive reform awhile back and they are considered one of the leaders on this issue and that's I think that's surprising to to most people\nRight so it's not necessarily a blue state red state thing they are red and blue states that are passing these reforms yeah absolutely [noise]\nThere's a real disconnect between members of Congress and what's happening in their own backyards that totally Harris executive director of justice action network that's a group working on bipartisan criminal justice reform oh he's a conservative herself\nShe used to be the general counsel to the Kentucky Republican Party and according to Holly on the state level Republicans are helping to lead the charge gets really conservative Republican governors that had been moving forward and aggressive way\nActually our our governor here in Kentucky is\nZealous advocate for reform um and you know we've passed just during his tenure felony expungement\nBuild that will improve conditions for incarcerated women so\nUm you know at the governor's or in the states and really get it and it doesn't hurt that it's also good for their budget they've got to fund education and and they're concerned about economic development and quite frankly\nWith the hundreds of millions and in some cases billions of dollars that you can save through reforms\nYou know you can invest more in those places and quite frankly if we invest more in those places maybe we wouldn't see as many people entering our justice system we have to take a short break more with Holly Harris in a minute and later the

district attorney in a city or county who doesn't really see justice of the way you see it justice can be nearly impossible\nThis year there's a grassroots movement to elect more progressive more diverse district attorneys Sean King is the cofounder of real justice\nFor years king worked as a civil rights activists after the shootings of black men and women by police and despite his incredible success on social media he wasn't seeing much success in bringing about policy change we\nMainly lost those battles for justice\nFor Eric Garner from my brow later for Tamir Rice for John Crawford for Freddie Gray for for Sandra Bland and in all of these fights week\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support WBAI at Cape and islands dot org\nOut of history it seems like we're human on the right side of of ethics morality integrity decency but nobody is being held responsible and it caused me to land kind of square and the space of saying hey I think a huge part of the problem\nIs this position of district attorney and when you have a district attorney in a city or county\nWho doesn't really see justice the way you see it justice can be nearly impossible and um I've done my life and to try to elect progressive reform minded compassionate district attorneys all over the country\nDid you know anything about how district attorneys work how they get into their position any of that\nNo I I really didn't and I don't think most Americans fully understand\nWhat the position of district attorney is what responsibilities they have and just how much influence and power and uh and how much leeway they have in what cases they pursue how they pursue them what cases they drop and um\nIt was really in twenty four team that I first came face to face with that reality in in four different cases with the case of Eric Garner the case of John Crawford the case of Mike Brown and then the case of Tamir Rice and Cleveland\nWhen I came to understand and they and it it took me almost three years to really understand this is that the entire world can be incredibly frustrated and deeply agitated about\nA single case of injustice and we could have the top trending topic in the world we can be on the front cover of every newspaper\nBut if the local district attorney doesn't feel the same way justice can be nearly impossible\nSo let's go to the numbers for a minute Shonda that how ... how they get into their possessions [noise] how many district attorneys are there in this country and are they all elected\nYeah so there are right now there and write about twenty five hundred district attorneys all over\nWhile the policies governing them vary from city to city county to county state to state effectively your local district attorney\nNormally functions in a city wide or county wide capacity\nAnd with the exception of of a few states where the governor gets to appoint those district attorneys they are elected locally and they normally are elected even in places that are highly engaged like like New York city they're normally elected\nBy just three or four percent of local people who show up to vote\nAnd so the overwhelming majority of district attorneys literally\nAre elected wants and often run on opposed sometimes not just for a few terms but for decades in some states they are a non partisan positions are in others they run as Democrats or Republicans\nAnd uh when I say that out loud most people around the country and around the world rather gas because the the their version of district attorneys around the country\nAre appointed nonpartisan positions so the idea that the person who's overseeing their local justice system is an elected partisan shocks people\nUm I think some of the challenge comes in here they are Ninety five percent white those twenty five hundred people they are nearly Ninety percent male uh and they are overwhelmingly conservative I mean what we're saying is hey\nWe can change the system's a little bit from the outside but that's not nearly as effective as what we can do inside\nOf these positions and so we're trying to encourage people hey you need to consider running for district attorney\nWell let's talk about one of those places where you got involved in Dallas County Calif a little bit about the candidate that you back and what happened in that race\nWhat we saw in Dallas and other cities and counties across the country\nIs the best civil rights leaders in those cities all they are telling people sometimes is go vote and go vote is not sophisticated enough is not complex enough to really change a very complex justice system and um\nWe saw a an amazing woman who stepped out to run a local judge named ... ...\nOh we were so excited to ah to backer and a lot of people are sometimes kind of adopt reform talking points but she like deeply want it to reform the system she saw how broken it was up close and personal\nAnd we were running against a a a former Republican who became a Democrat\nAnd um we ran our hearts out and I thought and I thought for sure that we were going to win that race and uh something wild happened we on election day actually won\nOver ... bought over Fifteen Percent but because he did so well in early voting a we ended up losing by just five hundred votes I think we also think we made a mistake there\nThere is this sliver of America that is desperate for reform\nBut for most people who are coming out the vote\nReform is not the main thing that's getting them out the vote its safety and you will struggle to win\nAny race if your opponent convinces voters if you want to be safe vote for me and if you if you want some reforms that may or may not affect you you can vote for your opponent but just know if you vote for me you will be safe\nAnd it took us losing to see that when we run\nExclusively on the phone [noise] and do the issue of safety over to our tone it will probably gonna lose every single time [noise]\nWe have to take a quick break more with Sean King in just a minute they would [noise]\nSupport for example you ca I comes from you and from auto
