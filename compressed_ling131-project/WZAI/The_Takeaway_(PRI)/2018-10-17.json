taking to the polls for mid term elections\nAs Rick Scott's term ends a crucial race for governor is heating up\nDemocrat Andrew Gillum is facing off against GOP candidate Ron defenses and voters are closely watching how each candidate is handling the hurricane response effort\nThirty and will also decide on whether or not to restore voting rights to one point five million felons Florida is one of three states along with Iowa and Kentucky that permanently take the vote away from convicted felons and there are questions about whether\nW see a sustaining members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org me\nSo there's a lot going on in Florida as we know um midterms are just a couple of weeks away how is this storm like Michael affecting or it could affect people's engagement not just getting to the polls but their desire to vote\nWhere Michael hit a interestingly is a heavily Republican area and really wiped out um a lot of the roads the uh infrastructure so immediately we're seeing questions about will\nThose counties in the Florida Panhandle be ready to vote for early voting on Monday and for election day so that'll be interesting to watch or they aren't the most populous counties but that seems like it might affect Republican turnout\nUm and just generally the hurricane has kind of reset\nThe table for the campaigns you know there were topics that were heavily in the media before the hurricane are formed in the Caribbean and began aiming for Tallahassee and\nThose issues like the economy and red tide were pretty quickly drowned out\nBy hurricane Michael and um the devastation that caused and the ongoing\nRecovery so I think it may change some state wide focus from voters on what they're thinking about and how they're viewing the candidates as governor Rick Scott runs against Bill Nelson and is heavily involved in recovery efforts and as Andrew Gillum\nI had to take a break from the campaign or as mayor Tallahassee to handle the storm or Ron dissent is no longer a congressman trying to ship his campaign to remain involved without an official role hurricane certainly shook things up in the campaigns\nDo we know that that's affected Gillum lead at all that he's had to sort of taste step aside to handle the hurricane or is this a campaign still going\nThe polls the recent polls have showed Gillum with a very narrow one point lead a new poll by saint Pete polls are came out this morning the really the first poll a taken to ... to potentially show hurricane effect and it still had\nGillum ... plus one um I I think you know the the assumption would be that he would get something of a bump given that he was a so heavily on the the media rotation during and after the store and more dissent\nA invested role and the recovery and the preparations are so I think I think we need to wait and see some of the polls that should be coming out in the next couple of days or a week or to see whether it will see any other shift but\nIn a state like Florida where a top of the ticket races are typically decided by one point or I don't think we're going to see either Andrew Gillum or ride to Santa is a a head or behind by too much\nWe talked a little bit at the opening about the possibility of getting Floridians to restore the right to vote for one point five million former felons in the state has there been any movement can you gauge what the interest is so far I'm On that ballot measure\nWhat late last month we saw a University of north for to pull that had a the ballot measure at Seventy one percent support to get on the ballot or the the backers of amendment for uh pursued a petition drive that received nearly nine hundred thousand signatures\nWhich obviously bodes well for support you would figure most of those sing the tours would also both for\nThe initiative um but in Florida you need you do need sixty percent to pass a ballot question and I I Do think one there is a campaign against it\nAnd to ... we're going to see some skepticism\nFrom people who either may not totally understand what the amendment speaks to do and the fact that I'm a convicted felons do have to complete their probation and parole in order to have their rights restored and then there'll be questions from voters about to what extent are they comfortable restoring voting rights for\nUm people who are convicted\nCertain non violent offenses uh and and I don't think that's a slam dunk\nWe talked a little bit also about the fact that a Florida Supreme Court has ruled that the current governor Rick Scott won't be able to appoint three state Supreme Court justices who are the justices who are stepping down and I'm Wondering how that will affect um the liberal majority\nWell right on the seven member court there are three of of four justices who have\nKind of formed somewhat of a liberal voting bloc and have at times ruled against Rick Scott they are due to age limits are stepping down um the day that the next governor is sworn in and given that that decision will now fall to either Andrew Gillum Rhonda Santas and they have\nSuch divergent opinions on what the court should look like that seems like\nThey're voting basis I think Republicans tend to be more attuned to\nIssues of the higher courts and the significance of it and\nWe did see some a speculation that perhaps the Kavanaugh hearings for the U.S Supreme Court\nMight have actually a given Ron descent as a bump who was trailing pretty consistently in the polls by decent margin or and then seem to get a bump around the time of the cabinet hearing so it's possible that that controversy energized\nFor the Republican voters maybe they were hesitant to side with the census over Trump\nOr or or any other issues and um and that might have given him a bump so probably better for the census Stanford yellow but certainly Planned Parenthood\nAbortion rights healthcare rights are front and center in the minds of democratic voters are so I I don't think that you know a liberal voters are just going to have their shoulders and think about it or
