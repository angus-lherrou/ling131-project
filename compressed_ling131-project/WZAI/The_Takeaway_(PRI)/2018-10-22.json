officials were fired\nAnd Eighteen others were arrested over the weekend following the kingdom's acknowledgement that ... was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul according to the Saudi investigation ... was killed after a confrontation in the consulate Turkish officials dispute this account and leaks to the press same the attack was targeted\nAmid the Saudis questionable explanation of ... death a new report from the New York times reveals how the Saudi Government uses troll farms to orchestrate digital attacks against dissidents and journalists including ...\nBen Hubbard is the Beirut bureau chief for the New York times and he's been reporting on these social media campaigns\nTroll farms are basically you're the best way to picture them would be like a call center like you would you know just to field public relations were crusts or a customer cost something like that except this is this'll be a group of people who've been hired to be very very active on social media to promote some kind of agenda in the case of the story that we wrote this was obviously to\nSort of do a number of things to try to benefit the relations during the the reputation of Saudi Arabia so this is to attack content that was appear to be negative to Saudi Arabia and promote content that is positive for Saudi Arabia\nAnd tell us who was behind the troll farm and whether that farm can be traced all the way back to the highest levels of the Saudi Government\nWell it would be pretty impossible for something like this to happen without the knowledge has decided to go so I mean this is a monarchy\nThat's a ... say impossible for this to happen unless it was signed off on you know by the government and we know that so one of the officials who was in charge of in charge of this effort is somebody who's very close to crown prince Mohammed bin some men who was you know the sort of the ... facto ruler up to kingdom\nAnd what are some of the messages that these drones were using\nTheir their various ways that they do this sometimes it's just to try to manipulates hashtags that are already out there so if there's a hashtags that they perceived to be negative to the kingdom they can sometimes just flooded with various kinds of spam so that\nIt becomes in a way unreasonable they also try to game the algorithms to Twitter has to try to get certain hashtags onto the trending topics so if there's hashtags picks up or there's some cases it may have actually been created created by them they can drive a tremendous amount of traffic to that\nAnd don't try to get it on the trending topics list which makes it much more likely than anybody inside of Saudi Arabia who's on Twitter is going to see that particular topic\nYou know to take a step back you kind of have to understand how important something like Twitter is in a country like Saudi Arabia\nAgain this is an authoritarian place that doesn't have really free media I mean almost all of the newspapers or government owned\nThere's not a lot of public engagement or civil society they're not really places where you can go and discuss and so\nWhen Twitter started spreading in Saudi Arabia probably seven or eight years ago it was you know it was a huge deal for the kingdom and and a lot of people then we're very optimistic and said oh this is going to be this great new technology that's going to lead to you know it's going to democratize the discourse\nWhat we've seen is that you know this government really had the ability to manipulate all of that because they have huge huge resources from the oil wealth they're able to buy really the best off the shelf technology that you can find\nAnd they just you know they're they're very organized so they can you know either create automated box or in the cases that we wrote about higher human boss who you know our trolls are called air sock puppets there's various terms that people intact used for this but basically hiring people whose job it is to weigh in on these social media to base it perfect shape the way that they go\nThey drowned out a lot of messages they say they've apple fight other messages they manage to get certain things that would not have been trending on the trending list on Twitter so they they've they've ended up being very effective and um they they they end up playing a real social media plays a very large role in these countries in just shaping people's perceptions of reality just as media does in any country\nBut the the difference is Saudi Arabia is that they're just fewer avenues out there and so when they can so effectively manipulate what people are seeing when they got on Twitter they can really have an effect on\nAround them of perceived their own their own government\nBut you also reported on an ex Twitter employee who was spying on behalf of the Saudi Government what do we know about that person\nWell we know that there was a Saudi engineer or Saudi Saudi ... person who got hired by Twitter was working there and then turn away basically tipped off by American law enforcement and said we have suspicions about this\nPerson that he has been whether he was working directly for Saudi intelligence or whether he'd been sort of recruited to do this bit of work for them is not entirely clear but the concerns were\nGreat enough that he was using has access to the company and has has access inside of Twitter to basically look up information about certain dissidents and provide that information to the Saudi Government\nAnd wondering if attention to this more now because a democracy ... death um he was in fact one of the folks who was targeted by these campaigns was he not\nHe was definitely targeted by these people you know there was you know ... mile by the time he was killed had last time I checked I think it was somewhere around a million and a half or more than a million and a half followers on Twitter he was very prolific on Twitter he would treat an Arabic he would treat an English he would interact with people he would have post articles and\nYou also so for someone like him this is a very powerful publishing platform I mean there are lots of articles published by the New York times that don't get a million and a half views but you know somebody like to have that many followers just saw this on Twitter ... so\nThey put a lot of effort into trying to fight back against him and so he would get lots and lots of comments and lots and lots of abuse and\nAnd and things like that so yeah he was definitely sort of one of the people on their list that they were you know try to influence the way that the content he was putting out was being received by people\nAt least enough to be clear that Twitter as a company has been under\nFire for a while now for what it allows it doesn't allow on its platform and how it controls when people can say and what they can't say\nAnd I'm Wondering from your reporting have they are said anything about all this have folks from Twitter responded to either the ah the employee who was supposedly working on behalf of the Saudis or how their platform is being used in this instance\nNot aware of any direct response from Twitter till the article that we published on Sunday I mean I Know that they they certainly have talked about other ways that they've tried to do this there was you know they put out information a few days ago I'm Talking about a large sort of bought network I think they called it that they had taken down that was sort of a pro pro Saudi ...\nSo you know there there there are certainly aware of the problem and you know when when when Twitter executive speak about this they say you know well we we want to do everything that we can to allow the medium to function we don't want to be censoring people we don't want to be taking\nThings down and less otherwise necessary so I mean I think for what are they they're trying to find the balance between keeping the medium as open as possible but then also stepping in when they need to to try to shut down things that are in a fair is\nBen Hubbard is the Beirut bureau chief for the New York times Ben thanks so much for your reporting on this\nDo you take away
