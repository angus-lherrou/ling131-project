but I Do not believe that he was the\nIs Emily a Collins is not up for re election in November but from what you've seen what's the reaction been so far to her vote I mean she\nPretty popular I mean and this seems to have at least for the time being harmed her obviously she's not up for election 'til twenty twenty so there's a lot of time between now and then that people are disappointed I'm\nMean we'll see sort of what happens in the next several months and years but I think that a lot of her constituents are disappointed and more broadly I think women around the United states who are looking to her to defend them are also disappointed and her\nWell and then not just disappointed there actually putting money towards funding her opponent what have we seen about that so far

Boston\n[noise]\nOver the summer the White House made a declaration of the nation war on poverty with quote\nLargely over and the success this is part of the administration's argument for an acting stricter work requirements for public assistance at the same time unemployment is at three point seven percent and the stock market is booming\nSo is the war on poverty really one well this week we're working with the center for Public Integrity to check in on parts of the country that are still struggling with poverty our first stop today ... Texas the small poor border town depends on its relationship with Mexico just steps away across the Rio Grande\nThe town would also be directly impacted by the president's proposed border wall\nYou know there's a lot of killing\nThere are some places that have that that um I mean living here it's quiet it that way with any\nThey've loving all is here to tell us all about this he's a federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and he's the editor of its new six part series Dave welcome to the takeaway good to be with your temperature so what is ... Texas like\n... percent of your Texas is sort of this\nTexas uh I used to report from Texas I've been there several times in a reporter Saddam Hussein who spent some time this summer down there found a place that really cut against the stereotype of what a border town is in the United states and what I mean by that is that\n... is incredibly dependent on its cross border sister town in Mexico in August ... Mexico and as a result quite literally people depend on ... for\nThe basics of life groceries water a transportation family there is such a cultural connection almost a symbiosis there that were a border wall to be built um most of the people there feel as if the community would be not only cut off but even killed by its own country and they feel that\nThe debate in Washington is a world away from the reality that they're living down there I ... which is very bleak and uh in high poverty a not a whole lot of crime but certainly a lot of needs that they feel go well beyond a border wall they don't want the wall at all\nWell let's talk a little bit about that I mean you said it's a high poverty area I'm going quite an in contrast with what the administration announced this summer that the war on poverty has largely over what is the main concern for folks and ... if it's not immigration if it's not the wall is poverty or is it something else [noise]\nPoverty but it's also jobs which I suppose the two are inextricably linked it's health on a very odd twist it in the story is that if you have a a an injury if you're very sick and you need to get medical care\nThere is only the most rudimentary basic medical care available and not in ... and you have to rely on the hospitals and knock out to to get a critical medical care otherwise you're going to be a matter of fact two at Texas a city that\nAre in minimum will be an hour away and if you really need serious care it could be four hours away by car so as a result of people feel very isolated or they feel that\nA Washington and the federal government and away as not eating their concerns this is a place for up until a couple of years ago the many of the streets were unpaved or in the city literally a dirt road town so something that you would expect to not necessarily in Texas but much more in Mexico but\nThe narrative is sort of flipped one eighty\nOne is just now it's interesting that you mentioned the narrative in effect for health care um Americans having to go across the border into Mexico to get health care I just want to make sure I understood that correctly\nThat's that's true and I even for a non critical care your your dentist might be there are certainly other ...\nIt might be there too so health both in an acute situation but also to and and just keeping yourself a fed to keeping your family fed and making sure that that you have the basics of daily life this is really the reality there and if it becomes more difficult for the cross border flow to\nTo flow as it were then that would be something that would be potentially disastrous and many of the minds of the people are ... you were that to come to bear\nOn also seems to again also fly in there and the face of the narrative that we need to quote unquote build the wall\nUm when there is this type of symbiotic relationship going back and forth between these two communities you know Dave you guys are looking at a number of different places around the country um and we'll be focusing on those throughout throughout the week but tell us why\nYou chose the places you chose what is it about these individual places that um tells the story that's different about the nation's war on poverty\nYou alluded to it earlier but yeah Donald Trump or as president has taken a sort of victory lap this summer and into the fall\nSaying that hey the war on poverty has largely been one of the economy is incredible that the stock market\nIs at its highest heights and for many parts of the country that is absolutely true and people are doing extremely well must underscore that but there are places that feel incredibly forgotten and that even though things might be great on one coast or another in this big city or that\nThey are struggling and might be an issue of education we go to Yahoo city Mississippi to tell a incredibly heart wrenching story there St Louis Missouri where\nHousing is such an issue on everyone's mind or should I say the lack of\nUh we go to a place like Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota where\nPeople feel incredibly disenfranchised all these places that\nWe may have only gone to sex but a representative of many other places throughout the country whether it's the uh the mountains of West Virginia maybe the the rural parts of Florida Gary Indiana Flint, Michigan these are all places that that are struggling that that have a reality that\nGoes against what ah what some leaders in Washington would like to have you believe\nWell we've got about a minute left and obviously we've just got a couple of weeks left before the midterm elections what could those elections mean for communities like ...\nAll this was happening with the backdrop of the mid term election and people have a choice to make their making it now in early voting in some states they will certainly had the opportunity to to make that choice in November\nLike this are struggling they they face a big question to which is whether they want to participate or even if they can participate the reality for a lot of people simply when you're working three jobs and just trying to make ends meet and keep your head above the poverty line it's very difficult to participate in such a critical vote is the one that we're facing right now\nThey love and solace the federal politics editor for the center

Syria you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support WBAI at Cape and islands dot org\nShe's also authored a series of plays set in Detroit a city that's central to her identity [noise]\nI'm from Detroit I was born and raised there and my husband's from Detroit and my family lives there and so for me Detroit as personal it's about family I always say that\nDetroit is also a metaphor for black America in this country and then therefore America large I think so when people are looking at the city were sort of looking at the social narrative a narrative around race in economics and our nation and stuff for me it's important to be writing about that in\nFor a place of within a I\nSo much love for the city because I have so much family there and and I have such a really particular upbringing there and so\nI don't feel like Detroit has had very human picture painted about it in terms of media exposure and so for me I Want to be a narrator on the city that's held more humane picture of our city\nIn one of your most recent plays you take on the issue that we're calling the school to prison pipeline where children are essentially criminalized and on that very young ages and um it's something that it's become a huge problem in in the United states how do you take a topic like that\nAnd bring it to the stage\nAnd keep audiences involved in such a heavy topic\nWell first of all I was an educator for many years and I was raised by an educator my mother was a teacher for forty years and highland park Michigan which is a\nA I call it a subsidy inside of Detroit um and so because of that I just have a vast knowledge about teaching I spent so much time and so many schools across New York city and all of you know the many public high schools in elementary schools\nAnd I have a very close and personal relationships to to teaching because of that if the public school teachers and privacy with teaching I've been in both\nUm and so it looking at that topic it's pandemic really and you have to look at it from really many angles and so my flight pipeline is about looking at it through a mother\nWho's trying to raise her son but also a mother who's a teacher in a public school so we get to see her relationship to the public school system her son who goes to a private school and had relationships that private school system and we're looking at base\nThe education how institutions can fail children and educator\nBoth in the public school maybe infrastructure early but in private schools culturally and both of those things are harmful to young people and can lead them to not having enough space for the total humanity and very most analyses young especially young black and brown boys and our nation and so that was important for me to try to explore\nOur producer who is putting the segment together found a an interview that you've done with NPR and here's where you say\nI always say that we can't allow ourselves to be cherry picked you know or to be the flavor of the month flavors come and go and I think that it feels like we're being flavored right now as opposed to being institutionalized and grown up from the bottom up and I think you were referring there to the opportunities the women of color\nSpecifically have within a the creative fields tell us a little bit about that what do you see going forward as now a newly minted MacArthur grant awarded the but also as a woman of color play right\n[noise] well I think that change doesn't just looked like putting people on the cover of things or in the on the brochures of things and it looks like if a structural change you know you have to change in leadership and we're seeing that evidenced in large and small way that our nation right now right leadership it come from the top down\nAnd so on because that in theater in particular it it means\nProgramming is decided by leaders you know how a theater as Ron How they're marketing department as Ron what kind of audience as they are bringing in that's all decided by the institution and so it takes people within that institution\nAnd leaders within that institution to have a very diverse um background and for women of color to being more positions of power and where they are making those decisions that so I think we need to see\nA shift and that so the work that I Do as an artist\nMy work is on stage but it's not just on to say just off of off the stage because it it it's a time in the world while I feel that it doesn't make sense for me as a woman of color to have work about people of color and then they're not to be people of color on the audience\nThere has to be a an entire collective shift that invites audiences of diverse backgrounds entered the house to have an experience together that's what makes theater special and that's what my work has to be the catalyst for\nIn Dominique I Do I agree with you a hundred percent and they don't know how we make that change\nIt starts first and foremost with community development\nWhen I spend their money on and that is ... but by and large because people are not following the buying patterns of people of color to suggest that we don't have the money or wall spend it on things out of the significant as fall\nI think it is off it's about cultivating a relationship that makes people want to spend their money on something that's what the other hadn't figured out but I Do also think affordability of tickets is a big deal and that needs to be\nThat needs to be addressed in theater there there's too much of a disparity between ticket prices especially when you're talking about Broadway but the biggest thing I think it's community development which means you cannot expect people to come to you\nLeave their communities to come over to see something at your house if you are not ever willing to go to them\nYou have to be willing to take work out and said their community\nOffered them something for free I always use it in terms of like food I say you know why would I leave my house where I Know that I can cook [laughter] I have my food so it comes to your house and eat junk food and I don't even know that you can cook and you brought me they're all samples like why would I spend money for companies to each of\nFood and I don't even know that I like your food that doesn't make sense you have to you have to tell me give me some samples bring me out and show me that I'm\nNot just a flavor but somebody that you're really trying to cultivate a meaningful relationship was that is the kind of thing that I think is missing and that we have to start doing and being way more active\nDominique worry so as a playwright whose work includes skeleton crew and pipelines thank
