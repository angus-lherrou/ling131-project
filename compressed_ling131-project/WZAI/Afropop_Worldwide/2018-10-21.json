name is Jason the Iraqis say I am forty two years old I'm born in Sweden\nMy mom is a a white American woman and my dad as an African American my dad came in sixty eight my mom is sixty nine that was raised in a home that was more or less an American I'm an African American home white American home but of course the town in the country that I grew up in was sweet and\nJason parents divorced when he was young and his father's household to Kansas strong diaspora identity\nMy dad has strong ties to Nigeria he's spent six years there as a boy there were a lot of Nigerians then also you know people from Tunisia Algeria from the Congo Cameroon gone a Pentagon\nCaribbean Trinidad South Africa India and of course African Americans and so I grew up when I was at\nMy father's home sharing those conversations in those ah perspectives on politics and world events but also on being black in Sweden\nThey'd often turned to me that points in the conversation and be like well Jason you're Swedish what do you think about this and I always felt kind of singled out and not belonging at that point because I was the one Swedish representative\nHas one kind of significant thing about my dad's homeless so rarely sweetest people there\nOf course Jason or Swedish but also a young black man in the land of white people\nIn his lessons in teachings he was always telling me that I needed to learn about how to be a black person in this country for my for six years of school I was basically bully everyday\nRacist and lack of different variations of the N word the school environment was showing me that you're not one of us and in the home environment there was that same talk from the other side no we're not a part of this\nThere was always you know the United states terrible it's so racist but it's also the best country in the world and so much better than Sweden\nThat's what I was raised to believe so at a young age that got a deep sense of not belonging\nFrom this conflict upbringing Jason ... he went on to become a famous and successful author and Swedish pop parties in fact discovering heap up was you know we sell they shouldn't it came early in Nineteen eighty nine when it comes in\nThat came and every\nTime I see on TV and Amy on me the best we can\nTo be a permanent\nThing is like a whole is coming in a sense or the feeling like I had arrived at something that I couldn't really identify with these rappers or so who are so angry force for the way the beep sound in the way they\nDress and carry themselves the damn thing in the videos and then of course the lyrics it made me want to be a part of that culture I just bought into it hook line and sinker\nJason was just ... feet in the the time I immediately started writing Raj somebody's on this is at a time when few around here because the ... if I knew what he was of course that much to change the early Swedish rappers wrapped in English and he needed American style\nThan the rapper path that came out what is the first record and it just made me want to round in Swedish unless the same time I made a whole lot of other people want to rush into it\nSo then rap music in the Swedish language was not born it was the liberal side and became very widely and now there is some people running in a suite very very clear\nFrom the start of juice and brought to the unique perspective to Swedish she bought a political perspective as in the early solar panel paranoia addressing refused them in Sweden probably\nGet the money spent and the debate has the same thing on the back more than they are
