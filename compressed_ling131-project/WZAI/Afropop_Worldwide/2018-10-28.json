looking back to the origins of worldwide Rosemary Pritzker host of the ... show hearts spoke with Africa founder Sean valuable and longtime producer Banning Eyre\nNo when I first back down at that I asked Jonathan banning wet and that to them to follow the heart well\nIt goes way back for me because my mother used to use that expression ... and you know we were raised in the sixties and my parents were pretty they were pretty liberal and they they always sort of had that ethic of you should do what you love\nI always had this conflict all through my formative years of I Love the writing and I love music and I really said both of them were thinks that you had to dedicate yourself to entirely so so it's like which one do I love more and I never really was able to make that decision so\nI Do both but it is exactly what it sounds like you do what post you don't think about\nYou know the practical or or economic implications to an extent you do but in the beginning I I was always driven by just going to places I wanted to go pursuing the things I wanted to playing the music I wanted to play writing\nThings in some of them a lot of them didn't work but\nI I still basically operate on that for instance\nI hadn't parents are very similar philosophy there was all about don't force your kids to do what you want them to do because the wind up resenting you and allow them to do or what they love to do and God Bless my parents that's they\nAnd I can just trace nature I grew up right on the Potomac River and I was all up and down the river all the time as a kid canoeing swimming swing and binds us\nIn the big national parks out west that was my passion and checking here there and everywhere but really it was music that kind of pulled it altogether for me as I'm\nI'm not a musician but studied music and I kind of I was aware of like some big aesthetic principles that guided job in these Indian African music and so on so I started doing a radio which has a passion for me and up in Alaska\nWhere I worked as a commercial fisherman and a cold storage worker and then and travel I Love to travel now has a big passionate and I think I tell all the interns who come here\nWhatever you do take time off from school and go traveling you know we live in Morocco you know spend time and then ... monastery whatever you know like you know become a an assistant to game\nWarden in Tanzania you know that's the stuff you really learn from\nIt was there anyone who inspired you and you're a kid who you looked up to\nWould start with my mother she inspired me a lot artistically well first of all she played guitar and sang songs\nAnd when she was in college you know in their thirties or forties she traveled through Mexico collecting folk song and she always had this idea of found to music and that that that was actually what started me playing guitar and she also made mobile she was a visual artist and\nJust her dedication to creativity would just put the whole idea of being an artist and in my mind very clearly\nThere were many another one I Would point to would be a particular teacher that I had in high school whose name was Gilbert Burnett and he'd been in the ... which was the precursor of the CIA he taught anthropology and biology and he was just very studious very demanding\nTeacher but he was so incredibly open minded and there were so many ideas\nThat I was introduced to as a high school student that really stuck with me ever since just ideas and culture and how culture makes people who they are dealing with the first person who really really talked about in culture [noise]\nTo me and made me think about it as all the things that you acquire in life in front of your surroundings as opposed to things that are just in bread and your genes in your blood and once that idea was in my head I've tended to think\nGuy turns to a high cuts Franco is wearing a better way and frankly some big guy like three hundred pounds and a deep voice I'd interviewed him so he knew he was I was an American journalist or something\nAnd he turned to me and said we use that as we know at least ... James Brown Otis ... dean but you know Americans you know when I'm On music\nAnd it was this like cry from the heart that just like pure my\nBecause he was right of course you know those phenomenal this is the best music in Africa and why it was just so little\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nMe not knowing 'cause obviously I was there and I was learning he was talking about me representing American citizen the rights to gripe is really bad situation I'll I'll Try to do something about it I think the fact\nThat came through but but anyway um and then the the the next time I went to Africa and by the uh banning to\nCome with me as a co producer and we also went to ... you just named the names of the stars at that moment where they're ... or\nA four year old a maybe a taboo early I mean just so many are largely in artists\nAnd fortunately no because we have recordings you can actually listen to the hardest yeah there's a lot of them are dead on uh anyways uh there's always new artist kind got so so we really were on a roll at that point actually we're ... we we had gotten funding from\nThe corporation for public broadcasting so I came back from this ... you know acne and could put together a little Thirteen parts and the big dog at CPB that and the radio program recommend\nRest in peace he said to me well San sternly\nThe panel listen to your demo tape and we think that Thirteen programs is not enough we want fifty two\nI don't know I said well I'd have to go back several times to do the research to Africa as do it\nJust you have an accountant no fun ones you have a computer no by what you know it's like you know basically gear up really quickly and yeah and then we ... we're on we're on you imagine would never happen today [laughter] yeah yeah so you know and and in in retrospect you know this is in the wake of\nGraceland you know God Bless Paul Simon and we're kind of the right\nPlace at the right time and uh we had the right concept you know and and and of course mostly the music are so powerful and don't know and that's the point of public broadcasting isn't it introduce people to learn new things for their aesthetic enjoyment and for their spiritual consideration\nUsing it you can join a man and you're really choked consideration to that\nWe're seeing back to experts from the ... to show off hard from an episode in which post Rosemary preached gr talk with Shawn Otto and planning air\nThat's me George hey how are you I'm good I'm good at George I'm breaking for a parent leaping out of the pod cast dimension because I think\nListeners want to hear from you too about the birth of afro pop we've dug into your back story and other programs I Know but today we'd really like to hear your version of how you came to close this program how does that happen while\nDining Nineteen eighty eight I\nHad already been broadcasting for Thirty years had several radio shows on the voice of America daily French breakfast show back seat room boom\nThe English evening programmed\nLoose tone deaf sold et cetera et cetera well they were all I must say quite successful\nWith audiences counting in millions I was presenting American music to\nAnd the world in general\nI played a lot of what the called race music changed round listen get Jimmy Smith and all these amazing people who are unknown on international airwaves much and that's\nGoing to eat fresh like African and it was my listeners made up of villagers city dwellers high officials and presidents and even people in the United states we're on track to his music and also by the high powered DJ style that I had\nThe only difference with the U.S radio drunks was my banter presenting life in America life in America what do you mean by that\nI was presenting America to Africa but I also found that my new country the United states of America\nNeeded to know more about Africa land that had brought them the crate African American musicians managed to conquer the world with them and blues rock and roll blues and jazz but you also lived in\nRight where you worked with a lot of African musicians in them right\nHere in the Nineteen seventies I was living in various wherever they being my radio shows on the voice of America industry doing that was set up a marriage I miss the I don't know if the bachelor knew\nI was also works on various projects [noise] an African music goes that went bankrupt I'd contract for several record companies for example with Warner Brothers\nAnd I would get all these record companies to contemplate\nI knew them all I had become their country to the world my studio became the meeting place of African artists in Paris\nAnd that's when I made the decision that they would present this enormously talented oddities when I went back to America wanted Americans to know them the idea was to produce a radio program\nPresenting these beautiful African musicians to radio stations in the U.S [noise] but\nI did not have the wherewithal and the concentration to accomplish this project I was involved in the program working with NGOs writing songs\nBut then one day a friend and the voice of America I told me that a radio producer was looking for somebody to present a program on African music on public radio radio what\nI was invited to go meet that person in the industry due and that's your job was in the big brick warehouse in the ... the New York avenue and\nI was a little nervous\nHave worked in many studios but none like this this sound engineer open the many security locks prevent me in and introduced me to a tall lanky be tackled and the jets the man who has that the public radio demeanor as I\nSaid the sound engineer accent treating the French pronounced fission of George me wrong bottle on\nWho was hardly sliding cents an hour ... I've heard a lot of good things about you as you heard I Need somebody to present the programs that I intend to produce for NPR so that she recorded them oh\nOh [laughter] louder that go to Corey founded recording this creek that Sean written except for the estimate is that they usually they forget to pronounce just see would you not pronouns S's in French all white Mosley\nTo Shaun ... professional eastern and\nAmen to sound engineer moves engineering I must say that to the sound of that deal was white amazing\nSo that's how long relationship started and like in our relationship everyone brings his gift to make it work Sean is fast manager and an excellent radio writer\nI bring my knowledge of Africa and my and food for presenting my continent to the world and maybe also his life or something to do it if the if the banning\nHe says a lot to deal with it but thank you that's a really wonderful to hear your story I\nI mean some are on Sean them banning ... show of hard to visit Africa bumps on our to our feature on the future I from father\nDon't let me see I'm just cleaning and you're listening to prop worldwide from the ally public radio international\n[noise] ...\nNow let's get back to Rosemary's conversation with Sean and banning\nSomehow afro pop has\nManaged to exist yes some yeah for like around or their ears yes that's amazing it is to me it is you know it was a Thirty Years' ago right now I made my first trip Sean second trip to Africa\nAnd he was such a great storyteller and he and he and he he taught me some of that to look at our stuff that I actually still play and dancing\nIs remarkable because there's this sort of certain ... style dancing where kick your [noise] your leg way high it's like how do you do that and you smash them\nThey would know who they are like ... like during the splits but like bending forward with their like their trunks or whatever and then slow it down on the ground I guess like award at\nAbout ... about smashing the scale of your enemy that's a good way to finish off yeah there's actually I have so Johnny ... bands mates\nWho as you say would go into townships where white and black bans were not suppose it was illegal illegal that shows and you got arrested how many calories than many last set\nI grew up listening to Johnny clients with my family\nHis music was profoundly important and for a minute for me last October Sean banning and I went to see him perform at the became the New York city is part of his could die to where it was a deeply moving enjoying that emotional experience\nThe thing is that John Johnny Was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer\nCouple of years ago and he's now been through chemotherapy twice and basically is prospects are good but he was in remission and so he decided to do a world tour farewell tour in kind of makes\nAnd you know I mean you've met so many artist so for years and sometimes they kind of remember you and they're friendly sometimes they don't remember you at all\nBut Johnny has always been really present you know he remembers right back to that first time we man and he has given us in just really spectacular very deep interviews over the years or so in this case he was singing one of the songs that he often ends to\nShow with Dale up which is really a beautiful song\nIt's kind of a song about longing and it has this great line that I think I Know why the doghouse afternoon yeah and then he thinks this incredibly moving course everyone singing along\nAnd then it has this refrain I burn for you\nAnd right when he hit it he's spotted made the audience and he pointed right at me and and that I had a bird or you yeah and I was like oh my God that was that was powerful yeah yeah how did that ... I was just really touched by it and then they sent shivers down my spine I mean it really was beautiful\nMinute and a\nAttorney would this beautiful and some\nWere sampling expert on the ... off\nCops recent history when we won the two thousand Fifteen Peabody institutional award recognizing our entire body of for\nThe moment that you found out that she had one what was that like oh the guy who was working at the time as our director of new media\nSent back her I thought he was on my leg you know I couldn't believe it you know like what what are you talking about like what what do you mean and and then and then it became real it actually got on the phone with the director of the few buddies who confided to me that he was really kind of lobbying believe for a time\nWhen that news came through I was actually on a ship and pray are burning in Cape Verde and I had I had my job was to do lectures and to arrange for concerts and there was an artist is there that we used a singer who was supposed to come on the ship and perform and they hadn't showed up\nAnd it and it was late in those kind of becoming stressful so I went down on my laptop and opened it up to find the contact number of the person that I was supposed to be talking to and there was this email from Sean saying that we just wanted to the body\nAnd it was it was just it was real I mean that was a wonderful day and a number of ways from that point on but it\nBut it was funny because the the director of energy and the was British woman and she had never heard of Africa now I didn't even really know what the buddy but you know I mentioned that George immediately got on her computer and it was funny thing was that\nThe other person who got you have to show more that you as David Attenborough and yet he was like God to her and it was like you wanted to say that we're so it was a funny daddy but boy that's a real high\nThe ... name again but it ... it when you're dealing with that but ... again by the\n... the table yet again that\nTheir ... as ... as we look back on Thirty years off from pop [noise]\nA few years ago\nGirls night we reached her to come to show them be referencing bubbling she was drawn by the music but also by the instruments used in spiritual practice the mirror is used to connect people literally with the spirits of their ancestors\nIs somebody you find all over the world you find it and sue the music\nAt least you find it in a ... music Peru\nSo many places music is used as a way of\nYou know saw talked about the journey of the ... kind of thing you're using the music to to actually transcend reality in the case of the show and it would be to\nThe conceptualize it as bringing about\nPossession of an ancestor so that you can actually communicate with that ancestor and figure out some problem we're having our resolve some situation or conflict that's another fascinating thing about a lot of African music is the way it forces you to re conceptualize the whole way that you think about music\nAnd culture not just like the way you think about music culture um\nAncestry because the the purpose of the embarrassed to call on the ancestors and as a result all all of these people in Zimbabwe know who their ancestors are going way back\nUm which I don't I don't know that about my you know like I Know a few generations back but I think a lot of as Americans like they all know have that kind of connection to our ancestry right right yeah we can go to anticipate accommodated on the air and you know\nIt's not actually everyone in some bubbly who knows that because of the very harsh nature of the Rhodesian regime and its insistence on interfering with culture that music remains stigmatized for a lot of involved with a lot of the urbanized soon Bob lines\nHave this very ambivalent relationship with that kind of culture like it's it's something that you do when you go home to the village at Christmas but in the city you wouldn't want to be associated with this as\nA whole cultural divide but that thing about ancestry that's actually even more true in the other music I spent a lot of time with which is the Grio music of West Africa like Mali where again it's a very elaborate beautiful musical tradition and but the whole content of the lyrics in this case\nIt's not about possession or anything mystical but it is very specifically about recounting\nHistory and talking about ancestors and a good grief has to know the stories of all the major families so that if they're at a wedding there is a person who's assigned to know each family that comes as gay so the ... have just arrived so then the ... no\nWeather all the stories that have to tell and what how can I relate that to the present and there's this whole miracle improvisation aspect but as a result of that I was just so amazed when I Lived in Mali in the mid nineties that little kids just knew all this history you know and that's not\nTrue in a lot of parts of Africa I think about the difference between us in our culture in school having to learn our history\nShut down our throats shouldn't that we can answer test question right compared to in certain African cultures where\nSomething that they learn from the culture that's gonna that's going to stick with you know much more because it it has\nSoul you know\nWe spend a lot of time in Mali but we just love love love love Molly\nAmazing artist or maize do people missing stress but anyways um the resource you goes back to the thirteenth century you people the artist who are the keepers of the
