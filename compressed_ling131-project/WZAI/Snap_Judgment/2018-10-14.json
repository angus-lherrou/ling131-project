to climb in the mountains of Kurdistan\n\nBest location in Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there so for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year a destination yes\nA lot cross the river and then get safely onto the other riverbank and that allowed the rest of us to\nSort of walk across this logging get across the river\nAnd Abdul came over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand them form up with Iraq and he was terrified of rock and laws\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if he didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nEnded up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle\nI was like well that's even better [noise]\nSo I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably when jobs frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy\nAnd smiling from Erie and patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and the kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like Penn and among the switch shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their causes that we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and up to try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they pray and they might not our business\nBut there's this guy in their country that's been charged with a really bad guy you like to themself president for life and they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time there was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nExplain to John but we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss was get get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this out and then we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention\nUltimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned the job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember bath and myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try to wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into\nTheir own hand and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as as evil as you might think even though we are seeing them murder\nSomebody I very much saw them as victims of circumstance in some ways it specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at it would be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but you would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashed in their schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to make for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice like as if you're talking about ... and ... and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats am I going to jump on this guy and just by his throat just teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker rock and um yeah as in many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody and others\n[noise]\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain one of the characters are ... split on now is only two characters with guns to for climbers they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did that for three days starving\nI came up with this really good game to play to pass the time um where\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nImagine eating it and then you start trying to count again [noise]\nAnd then finally one of his broken asks what time it was only two guesses and it turns out it had been five minutes\nAnd I think that's probably one time he changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering on our chief were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it does hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive and do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escaped\nBecause you came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guys his Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of said it was weird where we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and it obviously meant that he had bought the story that I spend a week selling to us just bought a hook line and sinker [noise]\nAnd so I grabbed his arm in Baghdad in Denali\nShirt pleading with him not to go\nIt's dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot anyways have parents off away from us we were all grabbing ham and begging him to knock out he he has this look like he's I Know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off than they split\nUp dual tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew led to up the mountain\nNow it was for two months\nFelt like my rib cage was going to explode there was just as a ball of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted to scream out loud because\nKnow one guy got a gun one guy has got to guns and a hand grenade a knife and ...\nOne down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate think basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of train especially since there was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that they was game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain\nTogether and I'm always trying to find [noise] uh\nI'm trying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way but also puts him in the most danger if he falls off or gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell that they were there like this is the moment I should I should push 'em right now this is our chance and then and then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with bass\nAnd the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something\nAnd I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still ... believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and went racing up to class\nAnd it just sort of scrambled up\nOver behind him and she wasn't expecting\nIt at all Mm but as I was reaching out to grab his gun strapped you sense what was going to happen and he turned towards me I got up close to him I reached out I grabbed his gun strapping I pulled as hard as I could and he just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of waiting to spark through them in life and he turned and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact and the whole way down\nI always knew that he had medical issues and then obviously it has to brand surgeries and I was really traumatic for me I think I was fourteen Fifteen some like that [noise]\nThis is huge brother Spencer and while stewardess stiff or brittle spent you know like everyone and his family to me all hearts and free spirit he loves being outdoors [noise] listen to the way he talks about mountain biking\nI like that I can kind of just zone out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down don't really like look ahead cranks revolving just felt like one two one two something like that you kinda you know you got that sense of joy and it's like flying down it\nThen too was always happy and healthy until one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old\n[noise] very terrible headache and he was diagnosed with amount formation in his brain [noise]\nI mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain Mao formations because he was crazy Spencer ... brain now formations had nothing to do with one another [noise] but it's been through brain situation didn't seem like it needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would resolve\nAnd this was about the time when it's been two became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery no matter what [noise]\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the NATO rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his input\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nOn the scale of one to Ken how strongly did you feel this way I was like I say about it and do you remember what you might have been scared of\n'em just knock for coming out of surgery as a totally different person but I think is what I was real scared of\nA different person since I was scared his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise]\nSometimes people experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous like there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take your picture for is the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family\nAnd it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer\nHe was worried that if you changed the brand new changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything was them all met her from it made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nSurgery instant connection here even if they help you know there was a ...\nOoh expressing some of my regrets about my own surgeries because I still\nHave symptoms and even after the second surgery in almost every day\nTime you\nMade it to him that one of my biggest regrets surgeries is now and my surgery as a fan\nIt's made me a [noise] somewhat better person at times\nI'm\nSo can I get a little fish philosophical with you there's like\n... okay [noise] um\nSo in like Julie ... story with Amy I'm binge pushed to question who we are so things like our nature are character or so\nAnd I'm Wondering if that's the term inspired brain or something less physical and I wonder what your thoughts are\nMy only problem in line the intersection of all of those things somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly from either set a goal to there and we spend to having severe headache again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to harbor medical center in Seattle\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I spent there was just talking butter Jay British and\nShortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that sort of his bed holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restart as I read and there for a few minutes as I watched and try to\nCatch his breath I I I thought we would lose them\n\nIt was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and got ... hospital room in the u._s. you [noise] to feed them [noise]\nIn a coma in a condition that I Hope I only I Would have to have dealt with and\nI Wish I could have been union\n\n\nWe're going to take a short break\nAnd when we return we'll Spencers family as they make the decision but no family should ever have to

family knew was that no matter what he never ever wanted to have brain surgery\n\nSpencer had a stroke and while he lay in the hospital bed sedated he's family his mom and dad Steven ... had to decide what to do and they had to decide whether or not to operate\nThey searched his name is Dr Keim and Dr Kim told them that if they did not operate now they were the one to five percent chance it's been
