most allies in music poetry and praise fashion and films the weather's signed it swaying to many different languages it's something that millions of people across the well to spot you and today it's practically a commodity a way to help sell products\nBut what exactly is who and why did it come from some even argue that it's impossible to define\nThough I suspect that my three guests today we'll try to convince you otherwise joining me from the United states is Joe ... a cultural historian a chilling University in New Orleans and the author of the origins of who in postwar America\nIn Massachusetts is Claudia Springer professor of English and film studies at frowning and State University who rate James Dean trying to get the many faces of rebel iconography\nAnd living in the studio if the writer and courageous Carol ... professor the Chelsea College of arts in London who started the concept of cool and her two thousand and sixteen book the bus of who style narratives of the African diaspora\nWelcome to all three of you and just start with I went to us each of you in time if you could just pick one example of who or what is the perfect example of cool for you personally and why Joe\nWell I don't like to choose an enemy of cool because of the concept changes every generation a little bit but since it started out as a set of strategies to defy racism I Will choose Muhammad Ali the heavyweight boxer\nAnd Ali although universally admired now a mostly white Americans hated Ali when he took them do some name and trash talk as a boxer so he grew up watching musicians which was Miles Davis but he knew that cool had to change into something more confrontational\nAnd so she didn't fight in the Vietnam War and he went to prison for three years at the prime of his career forfeiting probably ten million dollars in earnings and he famously said about Vietnam I'm not going to fight white people sending black people to fight yellow people to protect the country they stole from the red people\nSo he was an activist even though\nSex so finished Lester Young speaking not long before he died on the recording that features in the ... coming film president of beauty direction by Henry fettuccine so we've had that Lester Young embrace cool and influenced other jazz musicians including the next generation people like the trumpets or Miles Davis whose music we heard at the beginning of the program\nCarol can you briefly remind us who was Miles Davis and why is he considered an icon of cool\nAs an African American trumpeter embalmed leader and became iconic in terms of how he changed jazz music\nMiles Davis said that he wanted it to be kind of music that people could actually listened to him follow an even home to sit with much cooler rather than hop music if you like\nAnd then he terms of his um style there was a way that he dressed and made use of Ivy League style\nAnd this man I'm Chuck it and yes Chuck kitchen time and things like that he would buy clothes from shops on\nUniversity campuses in the United states whether it's bound with play so there's an um an album called the museums of miles and he's on the front cover there is no graphics [noise] so it's very unusual to Nineteen fifty five [noise]\nHe's in a um says took a jacket beautiful pale colors to fight club's kept a no shit underneath the jacket [noise] there's no smiling you still working directly into the camera and for me he's saying I'm black therefore I Am dealing with it\nSo he's playing with this time he's saying this is a sort of preppy style or young white men you choose expense of universities but on dressing like this\nIs kind of claiming it for himself exactly it's not just for one group it can be for me I'm like why wasn't\nThis emphasis on style on the on the looking good visual pose what we're talking about public stick his hand but more generally in sexual terms because he said something about your family you know how this relates to use\nSo when they came over from Jamaica to England in the Nineteen fifties they were still British colonial subjects close was important to them\nTo stress this idea of visibility that sense of pride making a life for themselves and Britain despite over in spite of\nThe racism to pull up our system that was rising and Britain the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties so there was this continuous actually feel like you have to present yourself the best way that you could but it was on their own terms in terms of how they wanted the will to see them\nUp to this point we're defined coolest largely an African American concept something that was developed by John's musicians as a result of being on the outside not belonging being the other but won't jobs was at the height of its popularity the idea of crew was manifesting itself\nSummer Nineteen forty one cache of buying it one time [noise]\nHauling Jim Joyce and all of pounds and all the world\nHumphrey Bogart as Rick

popularity of what was known as filmed well how does filmed while relate to who\nWell film water protecting us are disillusioned I'm cynical loners who often get embroiled in criminal activities this type of terse on ruffled male character was influenced by a hard boiled detective fiction [noise]\nIn the shadow ... why world the male protagonists just out of step with mainstream culture and he's looking for alternatives he's a new kind of hero because he chooses to opt out and exist on the margins of society he's a world weary and and alienated\nAnd why don't you think there's this idea these heroes these coups here is that resonated with the audience\n[noise] I think on the surface ah America was celebrating its victory over fascism in World War two there was an economic boom happening in this country following the war I'm On the surface there was a real sense of optimism and hope for the future\nSo for film the wire to ah refused that to reject optimism was a ... way of saying no to official culture and it did appeal to anybody who felt marginalized so in cinema\nUh there were many films that glorify the United states that were very cheerful and optimistic that film and the war was not this was a genre that was steeped in gloom and cynicism and disillusionment\nI'm Joel you said that the cool appeal that this film law is linked to the post war popularity in front of ... century slow such as like ... ...\nBriefly explain why in a way that is a wonderful historical concurrence or Albert ... who writes a book called the rebel a study of men involved in Nineteen fifty one\nAnd it is the first history or study of individual rebellion in the history of western philosophy and my favorite distillation in that book that is related to cool\nIs he says that I rebel therefore we exist and what he meant by that is if you're a rebellion is meaningful it must create the conditions for other people to rebel so Lester Young rebels and where's the shades and a slang and it encourages all these other jazz musicians to do it\nAnd the same is true with some of my comfort Bogart or Robert mentioned they establish a new way of masculine sort of toughness and acting and that provides a new model for fighting society fighting more dominant self congratulatory as a quality said\nAmericans sort of patriotism\nAnd so it is not an accident that historically all of this happens at the same time there is an overwhelming need for a new definition of what a dignity for an individual person means in a global culture when the question is how do you matter\n[noise] we've been talking about child should be talking about film we've been talking about this philosophical approach to cool that\nSeems to much concurrently for different reasons and in different sections of society and different countries [noise] the thing that strikes me is that all these kinds of coups seemed to be men where the women can women be cool to Cairo\nYes they can I mentioned earlier Billie Holiday as um my example of the epitome of cool Billie Holiday was a jazz artists a jazz singer and she has to be seen as a female ... so this idea of where a woman\nInvasive maternity and the ... in all aspects of their lives and uses clothes and the way they style themselves to help the articulation of my identity and that means for them\nOkay set us up a female ... jobs today what about in film to ah [noise]\nAh in film and why are women were often cooler than men and women refuse a docile and subservient role they pursue their own desires often ruthlessly um they can be interpreted as part of the backlash against women who went to work and traditionally male ...\nTo the film and why some fatalities depicted as dangerous evil ... mostly in dark shadows at night [noise] okay so what do you think about this\nIdea that maybe the weather that the icons of who seem to be mostly men\nIf you're talking about jazz musicians are Fillmore actors this notion of being sort of a rebel loner\nThe tough and stoic and stylish and brave and your art style this was not really associated with women for quite awhile first time I saw a woman\nReferred to as cool and a headline or as a description of her personality and charisma was actually a Kim Gordon who is a basis from the ban sonic youth from the eighties or in the nineties and\nSince twenty Thirteen I see it applied regularly to the women who are merged in the seventies and rock and roll Patti Smith\nDeborah Harry Chrissie Hi and and uh so I'm just saying that of course there've always been cool women but the term cool has never really been associated them until recently the newest rebel persona I specially in music for example are all women and so to some extent\nIf that concept is going to continue to be a vital concept it's going to have to be defined and read directed by women\nWell in the moment we will be taking a closer look at how cool developed and how that rebels spirit was taken out and buy later generations that's in part to this forum from the BBC well Saturdays straight off to the news summary\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

I'm doren I'm Virginia ... in rebel without a cause from Nineteen fifty five directed by Nicholas re according to this is a film that space for an entire generation of young Americans as he said but there's also point and he had these with the new teenagers very much opposed fulfillment on\nYes in fact the word teenager was relatively new at the time or to some extent it was a luxury to be a teenager at a time when\nThe economy was doing quite well and a young people didn't have to go to work and become just like their parents at a young age so they had a leisure time for perhaps the first time in American history and uh they were also board\nUm this was a time of white flight from the city's after World War two people move to the suburbs um and there wasn't much to do their so you've had this phenomenon of adolescence I'm at a loss for how to spend their time having the luxury of\nRebellious attitude not wanting to be like their parents because they didn't have to\nCount all the style that these films the fashion came to be seen as crucial to didn't as well as the actors\nOf course yes and it gave license to teenagers across the will to make use of everyday objects to say something new something different about what it meant to be a teenager so the classic of course the T shirt to white T shirt nice everyday object which started um [noise]\nAs part of a a naval uniform and around Nineteen sir teen was seen on the body of Marlon Brando in streetcar named desire than warmed by James Dean and rebel without a cause this dreaming white T shirt under red jacket\nCoupled with a a pair of jeans could save some things so radical one of the other major shake his from his parents we mustn't forget to embody thoughts rebels spirit was the thing I Elvis Presley\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise] so\nSo what did Elvis fits into this pantheon of cool\nWell Elvis fits in in both directions first of all Elvis worship Marlon Brando and James Dean are actually in the movie could grill plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away and when he first ran to Marlon Brando commissary on the studio lot\nHe shook his hand and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando\nSo that Elvis was a fan boy from Marlon Brando is kind of a shock looking back\nUh but the second thing is coming out of African American music Elvis basically gave white Americans permission to love African American music because he was white\nHe grew up in the deep south he grew up with the rhythm and blues and gospel music and it is important to remember that Elvis's first hits were also hits on the black charts on the rhythm and blues ... he was doing something somewhat a rich you know\nWith the African American rhythm and blues tradition\nAnd so although he has often sort of seen as inappropriate or and you could say he is or is not but a lot of his African American peers at the time also enjoyed his singing and his take on NASCAR contrition\nSo Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage and he is rockets and energetic he's in control of his performance but he knows what he's doing any once said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do it the next time\nSo we have this real knowledge of how pop works\nThe impact people like James Dean into Elvis Presley and popular culture has of course being huge and it's ... just such an idea of cool across the landscape but I Wonder what you will see in Kobe really talking about American cultural imperialism here is that what cool is in the end Joe no\nIt's sometimes is a certain way it's the power of American culture but ten years ago there was a poll thirty thousand people on line of global poll and among the questions were what is the coolest\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support double UCI at Cape and islands dot org\nWere I cons we actually consider cool and so there's a real sort of unconscious\nOr understanding that coal is an essential concept in American culture and in self definition now I'm not by any means saying are apologizing that there is an American cultural imperialism about consumer products and about capitalism that is of course true\nBut I think that there's both and there's a cool that's attributed capitalism and buying things that are associate with America and then there is that cool is a concept for self definition and rebel cool in America\nClose your what's your view\nOf the American concept of cool inspired young people around the world this is in part because American music and Hollywood films permeate the globe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nBut cultural imperialism is not the whole story in fact there's a constant cross fertilization between cultures adolescence internationally creatively reinvent the rebel icon for their own purposes\nAnd for post colonial young people the rebels style could be used a signal their dissatisfaction with the failed promises of of independence from colonialism unemployment poverty racism corrupt governments and oppression persistent both in the former colonies and then the former colonial powers\nThere was I found that to pick ... post colonial rebels um the French films lot hand from Nineteen Ninety five directed by much it costs the vets in which three young men from the ... the housing projects on the outskirts of Paris try to figure out how to respond to police violence\nTo bear is of African descent ... of Arab descent and Vince is Jewish one of their friends has been shot by police during a protest\nAnd they adopt a cool detached style to feel invincible to feel strong and they emulate what they've learned from pop culture but they discovered it doesn't protect them\nKind of what you think about this idea of cruise cultural imperialism for me it's not just about the kind of talking down if you like but it was that what ... the thing is that making use of those references to create something ...\nTheir own experiences in particular a particular geographical space\nI suppose that's what we've been tracking throughout this parade ground the way one star the cruelest being taken by another generation and turned it into it saying I'm not as we've been hearing coup hasn't remained static concept\nJob today everyone wants to be cruel and we're so things on the premise that that cool which seems to run counter to the original rebellious spiritual detachment from the mainstream conformity that we've been talking about so it was cool today there's\nConformity cool marketing cool and there's rebel cool and the marketing cool is the kind that people promote products and make it seem like you're a rebel if you have one or you'll be popular any of those things and then there's the grass roots rebel cool in which\nPeople and laid out adolescence choose icons that they admire that are rebels that they in a sense vicariously live through or lead them to their own path\nSo I Would say in terms of marketing cool cool is a rebel sensibility for consumer culture and that's ironic right so you don't want to conform so you pretend you're a rebel even though you're conforming\nYou're listening to the Cape and islands NPR

S. is obviously close with a new study leader and I don't believe that Turkish authorities or president or the one that really know how the U.S will react and right now that's incredibly crucial to them because the U.S and turkey have been\nHaving very poor relations over the summer and to go against Saudi Arabia one on one would be very difficult for turkey so right now Saudi Arabia and its course under pressure but it doesn't seem like they're really reacting to any pressure because they haven't really studied French\nThey haven't said anything beyond the fact that the camera footage

seats are being contested bought the Democrats are hoping to retake one or both of those houses\nFrank has long been a shop left wing critic of the policy arguing that it it turned its back on its traditional working class opposes and become defined by mountainous and complacency which culminated in the election of Donald Trump his new book Rome they've with oblivion reports from a sinking society shots what he calls a period of sinking liberal hopes\nI Love spoke to someone is Franco news out on the day off to the Trump victory I often have the Democrats learned anything over the past two years\nNo they haven't but that's not to say that they won't do really well this fall they may well sweep Congress this fall but if they do so it's because of what you know it's for the same reasons that that they always get rescued which is that the Republicans [laughter]\nScrewed up you know that they were that you've got this guy in the oval office who is this unbelievable jerk who has a antagonize\nSo many voters\nSo now the Democrats have not taken to heart any of the things that you and I\nTalked about so long ago two years ago now while you're not do things because they don't want to you know they like being who they are and they can see it as well as I can that someone like say a Bernie Sanders figure is extremely popular and the public would really go for a you know the kind of policies that someone like that would put in place but that's not what\nThey're interested in they just aren't interested in that they're interested in something else is a category mistake that's not who they are they also\nIn in front of me that they have gone full\n... candidates in certain places that you had always are in Nebraska as well as in places like New York state where you might expect that so they are they shoot sort of a different policy already starting to rise up ... you know I was just I I'm\nI shouldn't I shouldn't be so glum and so negative because of course there are the examples that you just mentioned there's a guy running for governor in Florida who looks really good there's a\nAlexandria Ocasio Cortez and I believe in the Bronx in New York City she looks really good and these people there's and there's many other examples and these people make me hopeful there's always some good people and the Democratic party and there's even good people\nWho are making noise is like the running for president in twenty twenty Elizabeth Warren is seems to be suggesting seems to be hinting at that I think she's the best thing in the world I'd love to see her run for president but are you saying that the party machine and actually\nThe ... yes and I'm thinking more about it's probably unfair to I'm Talking about the Democratic party because the organizations in this country are so diffuse [laughter] they aren't really even organizations\nBut I'm Talking here about the sort of pundit class in America that really sort of ...\nAnd that pundits class is how would I put this a doubling down on this sort of the philosophy of two thousand and sixteen intensifying their commitment to that philosophy and how would you describe that philosophy a it's a professional class plus various other groups women minorities\nYoung people that is you know the Democratic party and that's devoted to the Democratic party and that's you know all fine\nBut the important thing is what do you do about the white working class what do you do about this enormous group of voters that have slowly but surely over the decades moved from the Democratic column and to the Republican column and for many years the answer that the sort of pundit class in America would give is\nThat's not happening we don't need to worry about that and then all of a sudden in two thousand and sixteen it became undeniable that that was happening and so their answer now is to say there's nothing we can do about it what\nIf they're going to win big as you suggest in the midterms what's wrong then if they get power back that's the name of the game isn't it\nIt's short term thing is the problem Democrats often when because when the Republicans screw up\nAnd then the Republicans come back a couple of years later and and get them back this is the natural coming and going of American politics but let me remind you of the way\nThe sort of political situation in this country used to be after the Nineteen thirties and that was at the Democratic party controlled Congress from the year Nineteen thirty up until the year Nineteen Ninety four was only two brief interruptions or the Democratic party was overwhelmingly dominant in this country and the reason for that was because they were a party that\nWas obviously and clearly identified with the interests of working people and that's not the case anymore and they you know they did the Democrats deliberately turn their back on that version of themselves\nBeginning in the seventies but sort of a coming into fruition and around Nineteen Ninety four and they turn their back on that version of themselves and they have never really recovered from it\nYou posit at the end of your book the unthinkable to Democrats of President Trump getting reelected what would you give us chances at the moment\nRemember I had all sorts of ... there that I I said if if he you know this is all off if he gets impeached or if he if it's if he messes up the economy with one of his dumb trade wars or if he gets in a real shooting war you know which he could easily do than all bets are off but the way things are going right now I\nHate to say this as you have no doubt gas I'm pretty far to the left I think Trump has a very good chance of being reelected in twenty twenty\nYou don't think the Democrats have a candidate up their sleeve who can talk to those votes as they need to get back into the\nFold they do there are Democrats out there who can\nWhen you contributed WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support double UCI at Cape and islands dot org I remember the um period of the Nineteen nineties when we had\nThe sort of boom economy of the Nineteen nineties and there was real wage growth for a couple of years and Bill Clinton became incredibly popular you know like sixty Seventy percent approval ratings and this was this was when he was in the middle\nIn the process of being impeached you know it was it was the most incredible thing and I can't help but think that if you get that kind of economic situation again almost doesn't matter\nWhat the other side does um that\nWas the American author Thomas Frank on his new book from David with oblivion reports from\nSinking society just reminded that if you missed any lines edition
