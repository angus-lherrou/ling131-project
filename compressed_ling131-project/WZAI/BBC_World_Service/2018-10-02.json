and coral nurseries are a tool basically for restoration efforts to produce more corals\nUm nurseries are coral nurseries are just like a plant nursery but instead of having a greenhouse nurseries are located in the ocean and about ten to five meters deep\nAnd the nurseries are places where we've installed what's known as the coral tree and the core restoration foundation is actually one of the

different to what we would normally see in in ... not struggling so unusual mortality event because I'm the carcasses that are coming at a show of incredibly decomposed so [noise]\nUm we we actually had an investigating this last month pathology point of view and moved from a sort of oceanographic aspect to try and work out why these animals have come from\n[noise] so it's not that they're being washed off and then they die they're dead when they reach the surface\nYes exactly um so when we we we have an investigation program that looks at uh the causes mortality of of mammals are stations sales et cetera\nAnd I'm In the past we've had what a cold must running events where we turned up on the beach and the uh I'm a significant number of animals I'm all in one group um some of them still in the wars that some of them on the beat some of them lives in them that\nI'm I'm way investigators try and work out why they're strong thing happened in this case it's it's a very different picture of what we've seen is over the course of the last six\nOf a very unusual species that's being washing up a light from the sort of the the go away by an island all the rights to the top of Scotland\nUm so it stays taken us a while to put the pieces together these animals are not alive um they've been dead for for several weeks at sea um but it's very unusual to to get any of these animals coming on TALK shows\nHow many in a normal year would you see and how many of you've seen\nThis year [noise] so in a usual yeah um we would get probably between three and four animals in Scotland of this particular species a it's a ... ... it's a it's quite a cryptic species we now she by little about these these class substitutions\nI'm On this year so far um we've had sixty eight of these animals that have been washed up I'm On the shores of islands Northern Ireland in Scotland I'm forty five alone in ...\n[noise] they live very deep and the water don't they so what do you think what what is it what is it possible speculate might be happening [noise]\nWell this is what makes this quite tricky because they um that they as you say that a species that live well off the shelf hedge survey they inhabit deep ocean trenches they can they held the record for both the deepest and the longest dive of any any animal um they've been clocked to\nJust a under three kilometers down and they can spend up to two hours down there\nThe reason they go into the the they such extreme environments just because that's where they can find that food which is a squid\nAnd um these these ... to a large number of them off the off the shelf hedge so this is the normal habitat for the species\nUm now that there's the problem is is that when these animals wash your show is very limited amounts of pathology that we can divide from from them because they've been such a expensive states the decomposition\nHowever we are I'm aware that this particular species is particularly sensitive to I'm underwater noise um human ... noise in an in specific the effects of ...\nOn that something that we would want to try and establish whether or not with any particular activities going on off the shelf age I'm In the last a couple of months that put a lot of this this this noise in the million and bottom\nAny ideas because you know humans haven't been quiet and the seat for quite a long time that something like this should be happening now seems remarkable\nAnd we we've we've made the oceans divide noisy place in a not so that's just as a general problem in this specific case\nFor them we have is is that they ... out of the people that operates the major Einstein all off in the military I'm driving information from them can be quite challenging\nUm the reason that the military operates a an a sudden all this week from says is that it's used for um communication on the association for locating underwater objects such submarines\nSo I'm obviously this is this is sensitive to national security level so they're trying to get the information as to whether they'd be not but I think can be challenging however what we hope to be able to do is to establish whether or not they\nAre noise is a plausible reason that these are almost on did so we want to let all the other things that could potentially have caused them to a strong such as toxins infectious disease\nI'm I'm trying to
