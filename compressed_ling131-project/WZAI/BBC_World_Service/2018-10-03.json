break the law\nWe talking about the emergency broadcast system every so often all American radio and TV channels sound a squawking great sing along to test the system which in theory would be used were less everyone to a threat\nOr obviously we don't want to cause any alone by playing the alarm so we're just going to talk about the alum there's a new addition to a to keep up with the times a text message or let a fourteen twenty later today everyone and\nWe mean literally everyone is going to receive a presidential ... it's a text from the president and is the first test of the latest debate of the emergency alert system you cannot opt out\nThe ... however since voted by everyone that there's some interesting issues behind this and history as well and we got it from Andrew ... who is with Harvard Kennedy School bell ...\nThe alert system has been around for about fifty five years as a way for the president to quickly sent a short message to the nation and the case of pretty much only southern nuclear attack where there was not a lot of time to furnish message\nUm that message was always going to be carried on radio and television and most Americans will probably recognize the shrill attention tone that it broadcast or from the regular tests that have been going on right spot tomorrow's is different because tomorrow will be the first time\nA system that was built over the last few years to allow it broadcast or directly to cell phones is being used fries\nIt's interesting because cell phone's been around for a while because if the government is catching up a little bit late\nRight this was actually a implemented at a couple of years ago during the Obama administration as a way to say\nThe civil defense status that is the emergency alert system needs to be modernized and now that we have this new phenomenon which is to say everyone in America more or less has a cell phone on their person um wouldn't it be nice to be able to reach them immediately\nOld television and radio channels would come together and we'll broadcast from wherever the prison walls or do a a sort of a pre recorded broadcast\nEssentially yes there was um a FCC requirements on the Federal Communications commission\nParticipate if you are public broadcast or a private broadcaster for that matter ... so if you are one of the primary channels for your city or your region you would be um made to carry a message or the or emergency of where it would go off and they would say this is a message from the White House stay tuned for more information stay on this channel\n... they would they would do tests so Americans with ... with the sound that that would be told that this is a test of the system as the\nThe emotions you Brokaw system\nYes there was a required a monthly test and some places the weekly tests as well but often you know it was a midnight or a little bit later so I'm a lot of people found out by when the news and on the couch or it would make them up in a very ...\nThat sounds like a cultural thing this is a trip to the Americans none of the people outside of America wouldn't know that is that's a great detail I Love that [noise] so do people talk about this\nThere's been this rising tide of awareness where people are realizing that this is something that's going to happen this is coming straight to everybody and I think the part that is really getting people burn is the fact that it will say it will be labeled at the top of the the text message that arise as presidential alert\n[noise] yeah I'm a social media message from President Trump um that wouldn't be confusing would ditch [noise]\nUh no I I think at some point or another\nThat is what everyone is fearing is that the system will be taken away from its original purpose and that will suddenly get an emergency alert to the entire nation that says no collusion but there are also to road blocks I think that having that happen right the first one is that is illegal they did set this up to say\nThere is a way to use this is only for emergency situations and anything else especially politically would be illegal now a lot of people say well maybe that doesn't slow you down to legal part won't stop someone who has already done so much to a scandal as the country\nUm but the actual activation procedures it would go from the White House in Trump's authority only but the procedures would be handled by FEMA so the officials there would have a modicum of oversight to say the least I don't think that it would be like his Twitter account were hit on constrained access at any time\nRight so it is slightly and they'll just by the emergency management um uh people presumably Yukon reply so this text\nRight and [laughter] I I Want to think of what would happen if someone else took control of the system though and sent some message either in farce or in you know ... to the entire country in the wrong moment right\nOh is that having a real message come through a at an untimely time\nYeah reply old would lead to trouble but ... ... ... of the ... center at the Harvard Kennedy School or just to spoil your anticipation that message are we going to get says this\nThis is a test of the national while this emergency alert system no action is needed\nBut coming from the you know are we going to get all caps look for example well this is this is the thing I'm I'm In fact well what a hundred other people are interested in Aden is the kind of the fact that many people who have a policy is due to the current occupy of the White House will just kind of go\nI don't want to Mr the president's going to ignore it even when it could be quite important and likewise if somebody else we're in the White House\nThe other half of America would a possibly avoid as well as he was saying um it just feels as\nThe president count really send a personal message but bear in mind that these false alarms do actually happened and why that there was like a ... there was a a a false alarm with a ballistic missile attack which went home for thirty minutes before\nThe pug was actually pulled the noise by the way from quite pleased we

like Liberia there's some pretty remote rural places where people either don't have a cell phone network in some cases people who are illiterate maybe some of the people who need the help most are the
