national emerging infectious diseases the bar trees in the United states I spoke to her a bit earlier about these kinds of attacks from people who are still denying that this virus exists\nScary disease right and I think health care workers you must see the men's about it\nThe equipment with the with the isolation of of patients all of this\nTends to be quite alien and you're trying to convince people who are suffering from a disease that potentially is has a high mortality to leave their family members to be taken away at a time when they'd rather spend those last moments with their family members and so I I think all of those are already dynamics that are in play to create just trust and\nUm I I think to add to that I think and particularly in the are the are looking at an environment where there has been active conflict for a long period of time so you're asking people to come into care to to become stationary um and and to give up that amount of trust you know to outsiders wage which is I got to be hard to begin\nWith it's interesting though because I could understand that may be twenty fourteen when all of this was happening and as you say there was the outbreak and in places like Sierra Leone certainly own and people were still trying to come to terms with the fact that they cannot properly say good bye to a loved one who's died they can't touch them they can't bury them\nBut the DR seat for example that had many Ebola outbreaks and in the past ... we would expect that it's become part of the general knowledge that\nYou know the ... by now people know that it's so dangerous that you shouldn't be in contact with with the body of someone who's died of Ebola\nI I think that those are two very different community and you don't know if the people who are involved currently had that knowledge permeates through those communities right and even if the knowledge is there it's not so much potentially a knowledge issue as much as there is a trust issue\nI mean think about climate change ... him and it's the same thing like you have so many people have the science and may not believe that it's the same thing here where they may have been told it\nBut it's in the end it it comes to building long term bridges to those communities and and having those already in place before a crisis like this happens and I think that's why you're sort of seeing that district and not and and I think these are communities like I said that has been affected by conflict for a long period of time that may not have that trust at baseline\nHow do you prepare there was a health worker um to to care for the patients were to go into the area here for the patience to go out to go in the area but also to face this kind of of of backlash it\nI Can't even imagine I can tell you just without in in the early on when I was taking care of patients it was hard to begin with because you're providing care in this very strenuous situation that takes a lot of physiological reserve but it also alters the kind of care that you can provide you know it alters the relationship you can develop with the patient because you\nThe clip meant and then they add to all of that I think you're also acting\nIn a in a in an environment where you're worried for your own safety and I think patients can sense that rate and and and we do our best to make that connection and so all of those things combined in in addition to sort of\nUm having going into a community that you you have not care for the past this is why national healthcare workers training national health care workers and making them available and making giving them their resources is probably the best strategy in the future because\nThey have that connection you can connect with the community and that's why the artsy had been successful I mean you can see the prior outbreak the one that happened in ... like they were searched at that point controlling\nBecause of those existing network and

Christopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron see because actually it might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the old\nSinuses throughout the I think it's very limited have lung cancer and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy we've had over a hundred and fifty expiration if in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and ah\nIf I can draw ... find out what's next incident and I came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said now China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if\nYou go to the national conferences where we are discussing climate change and I feel if I was in Oxford\nLast week and that was at the summary of the whole conference it was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan\nTo get off that feels good ...\nI Would look at the time frame because ... says well it could be dreaming until twenty Seventy yeah it will\nIt will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty one third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that\nWe will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to\nMake shift without it and remember that is\nBased if we go to do a big big job we do to increase renewables about six thousand percent\nAnother huge huge job ... on on how do you want to just\nTo mention also that we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that you know it's not and we've been debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time\nAnd it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but he's also important to understand that the speed of that\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support double UCI at Cape and islands dot org\nGas and oil teams competition with the down as a politician and in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green\nIt's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow long does anybody else can I buy and\nWell it's difficult in a way that it's become easy I've I've been working environment fallacious for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become ... but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you think that well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of who we are and how we identify yourself in this I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that\nWe're not talking about ... thing down the protection that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince citizens\nWe have to look on what are our options what are the renewables for example\nWhere are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable but where do you get to do so well uh you get that perhaps if you're a lucky from a organic waste and it's part of the circle but uh if not you have to\nProduce it by and making some of our Lance part of the ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and if you want to have more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that the now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that the ... that's called ... new now they changed the name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green\n... at the same time we have to address CCS and sees you because carbon capture and storage on carbon capture and usage is both a central themes in the transition into but now we don't have which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things\nThis is one of the great things we could use our universe dues for the ... from the barn she is like ... on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution there's a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we are\nKind of you wants to connect with CBS is definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway led effort political party actually agree on it sounds like a yeah what we mean by that cash a story and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away the underground all under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that\nTechnology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government say no way are shifting governments have spent quite a ... a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and the south has been focused on in our right for Twenty years I think you also need to challenge the politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think\nWhen we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if you're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you pleased to let us know what you think of the program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story at BBC don't casual UK and you can

I think you would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan't government's fault no none of this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the merits him a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift or even though we've we have a increasing tourists man and a ... a great expense and the amount of time sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to wonder why don't you think you've made it out there I Know but it's it it sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now and the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nIn other concentrates at the moment I mean look at China that the speeds\nOf ... of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well what a coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument is that you will see now that renewable energy will indeed be more cost effective than fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today\nBy producing and exporting petroleum\nWell that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new each gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls the way a little bit from Russia\nGave does it does a good story about into beta in Lithuania there's the port city there's an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independence from Russian guys an older guys\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the ... comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than ... wanted to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she could argue that no Asian energies plane as some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to leave policies that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn the parents said they have drilled about twice as much U.S Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression area that we need to drill before rush up to set the standard in the ... and see and I don't think it's necessarily get that nor by goes to Brussels and love bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\n... that'd according to the carbon projects on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally since the summer\nKnow if the carbon prices high in Europe Gus will exclude cold wave to court or lay on what you mean by that call them price\nThe price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but\nUm there's a market inside Europe um the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those prices starting to
