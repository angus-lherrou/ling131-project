a paradox this country is still a major party sat on the exposure of oil and gas on the real story this week what did they seem to waste energy future what\nA country that's grown rich and the

the will I Want to begin by asking each you how strong would you say a new ways green credentials\nCarry it has ... well I Do\nBelieve that although we have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention what a\nVarious political parties have done the wreck the several years transforming that the um transportation secretary that we have here in in our way\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across the highway and that's something that that I Believe that we should be quite proud of Ken Goodman since\nI agree last month a fifty percent of all new cars where electrical and that's a ... a a major league towards a more green society especially when we know that the transport sector is a a big country to be thrown into the field to\nCredits yes so for me I think it's very important that we have an active policy towards thinking new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives us money to do all the research on her\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screened battery than region hydro power in the region hydropower is one tenth in energy of what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries who will take place in Europe\nFive percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and I'm just relaxing sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced him carry this because he is not to view this shed by much of the Norwegian public that actually ... the new way does is we do it well it's not safe policing\nWhen the power comes from no way we take it out from the ground where the good guys none of\nUs I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also\nWhat's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and the ... transition now from fossil fuels and being dependent on importing fulfills few in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of unusual energy and that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that is going to change the markets to which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as you\nCan sense should the Norwegian government be grunting new exploration licenses for oil and places like the ... seats in the ...\nI Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and Main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate gets ... can Goodman says\nWell I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on coal in the works\nBut I don't know oh yeah we're talking about oh yeah\nMy point is that if you have replaced coal plants root for example of gas or even oil\nThat will be more green in the ... world my point is that if we want to make the verdict greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway\nI have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have\nI'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually if you do\nLose their Christopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then driven the vibrancy because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited have long ah cats here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy we've had over a hundred and fifty expiration of the parents the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw ... find out what's next fenced in and out came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said\nNow China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if\nYou go to the international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in Oxford last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway as the bad guy and to put it into words of the students at when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan\nTo get off off that feels good ...\nI Would look up the timeframe\nBecause clearly but says well it could be draining on two twenty Seventy yeah it will it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to\nMake shift without it and remember that is based if we go to do a big\nBig job we do to increase renewables about six thousand percent\nUnless it's a huge huge job ... on on how do you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that you like to know soft and we've been debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time\nAnd it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but he's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce states being built in ... new investments are being made into renewable energy\nDifferent types of renewable energy which are cheaper than gas and oil in competition with the down as a politician and in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green\nIt's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow long does anybody else can I buy and\nWell it's difficult in a way that it's become used to have I been working environment ... for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become used the act but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you think that well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of who we are and how we identify ourselves and I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that\nWe're not talking about shutting down the protection that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince is kind of\nWe have to look on what are our options what are the renewables for example\nWhere are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable\nBut where do you have to buy diesel well uh you get there so perhaps if you're a lucky from or organic waste and it's part of the circle that or if not you have to produce it by making some of our lens part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that the now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that the ... that's called at the new now they changed the name it's part of the stresses they because\nThey understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just had a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green is a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green\n... at the same time we have to address CCS and it's easy you because carbon capture and storage on carbon capture and use it is both a central themes in the transition into\nThe ... down of which have successfully than no trial with ... again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to this is one of the great things that we could use our universities for the algae is from the burned\nThe ... on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution there's a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we are\nKind of you wants to connect with CBS is definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway led effort political party actually ... let's just say yes what we need cash a story and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away underground or under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think the technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use on the government in no way of shifting government so it's been quite a lot with a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and CCF has been folks don't innovate for Twenty years I think we also need to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas and I think when we know\nWhat the harm is doing the climate changes if you're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please let us know what you think of the program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story at BBC dealt Kendall UK and you can subscribe to the ... such a BBC the real story and you'll probably cost up [noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has made possible by American public media producer and distributor of award winning public radio contact with support from beard financial partner guarding families businesses communities and institutions since Nineteen Nineteen or W Baird dot com has more information [laughter]\nAnd we're working there with the local uh energy company or or the regional and we're actually looking at it together with the communities and the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will be beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future it's it's really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan\nWith energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat they have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should ... sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of bringing ...\nAnd make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical ... which in creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house building we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and shit because for a shift nation and I was being so there was\nAn I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security has of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we've talked about there's only two developments and then to reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries for really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists may or may actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other issue is we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you were an engineer in in ... I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFurther than oil actually had developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nGovernment's fault no most of this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American I'm a business so I mean this is something we have to strive to shift to the degree and shift\nOr even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expansion Andy a matter of time sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to think you've made that I Know but it's it it sounds like it doesn't actually sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now and the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nIn other concentrates at the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds\nOf ... of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well what a coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument is that you will see now that you and your ... and then she will indeed be more cost effective than fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today\nBy producing and exporting petroleum\nWell that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this the country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new each gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls away a little bit from Russia gave\n[laughter] and there's a there's a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there's an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independence from Russian guys an older guys\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the barn she comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than ... not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that no Asian energies plane as some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to these powers that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn the parents said they have drilled about twice as much U.S Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression area that we need to drill before rush up to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily get that nor by goes to Brussels and loved it for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so it's about a black and white picture\nCat that ... that is according to the carbon projects on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally sees the summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the prices high and Europe I guess we'll exclude\nThey call them price the price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but\nOn the market inside Europe I'm the president would be or to fishery low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those prices starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push health renewables\nBut he's still a in order to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid to be able to carve improving no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd ... and that is so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity that coal fired no gas fired power plants are\nThey are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway count we can't take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and and ... but\nThat is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy so I mean we're gonna keep exporting guests to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but\nIt does is about what kind of view do we have for your past twenty fifty and Europe's committed to have\nA hero come get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector of the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way but it's a very poor country in the Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people are ... are the way which treats citizens of the fact that it gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on\nIf it was on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... the underpins this country that's going to keep it wealthy but with no way somehow lose some of it stasis is no way\nAfraid pot from some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you painting of far too short picture because no it was a will for states before they all came\nNowhere made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas remember your along the coast in Europe or the ... only plays in Europe which hasn't been any comments\nEasy accessible proteins so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on on\nThank God we didn't have an ability we we have a terrier side in looking\nAt a lot at the history and one important objective and an incentive is supposed to keep in moderate pace of extraction\nAnd when they hit that limit that sat in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit triple production within Fifteen Years and then the ten years afterwards the almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states\nBut we also have this workforce that we can use for other purposes so I think tying ourselves to tightly to oil we should ...\nBut but I guess I think what I'm asking is is somehow psychologically has it allowed no way to punch above its weight can\nI think we could just up the oil and gas tomorrow and it wouldn't have anything to do with our views on ourselves because\nHave Joni Mitchell we continue with this series ended ten ... good an\nUnexpected stuff on ...\nIt's all in arts and ideas Sunday
