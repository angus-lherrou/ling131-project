I. S. C. O. X. dot com or from an agent is Cox insurance encourage courage and by fracture\nSomeone else who seems dissuaded ... is President Trump he's routinely claim that millions of people voted illegally when he was elected two years ago\nHe's never offered any evidence for that claim but often the election he did set up a commission to investigate election integrity from votes costs to vote to registration forms there's\nNo actual or real verification by election officials once they get that for him to make sure that for example it's a real person\n... is a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation a think tank in Washington DC and he was a member of the president's commission\nExample of the problem is is there is a question on the form that says are you in the United states citizen and there's lots of evidence that citizens are illegally registering and voting\nBecause again that's not jak that's a problem and is the problem that in many states your show any id to vote you simply walk into a polling place\nGive them a name and you get to vote and you know what your opponents say about you they say that you are stirring up\nA specter for problem where there was really a problem\nI respond to that by citing an opinion from the United States Supreme court which is our highest court of the law back in two thousand eight what the Supreme Court said is that the United states has a long unfortunate history of voter fraud it's been documented by historians and journalists\nAnd it could make the difference in a close election I don't think anybody disagrees that if you have a national election\nWhere the margin of victory has tens of millions of votes it would take an awful lot of fraud to change that and is probably unlikely but we have many many elections in this country particularly at the state and local and city level and many of those elections are decided by just a handful\nOf votes ... taking the southern states but not only in the southern states a long history of folk to suppression and what your political opponents say is that the kind of measures that you were talking about fixing to unfortunate packed in the thirties suppression\nNo doubt that they're convenient a scapegoating of them in order to oppose them requiring everyone to show an ID when they vote is no way going to suppress votes\nIn fact it's a bit patronizing I think and frankly borders on racist to believe that for example African Americans don't have the ability to get an ID the way white Americans do or Asian Americans\nThat many African Americans only spoke to in North Carolina took a different view especially since the states ... was ruled unconstitutional\nThe appeals court said it was written with discriminate street intent to impose cute the problems that did not exist and targeted African Americans with most surgical precision tons if he could understand why African Americans might be skeptical\nOh I can understand why they would think that but it's not true the whole point of what the those who were suing said was this is going to a depressed turn out the number of African Americans voting will go down the exact opposite happened in fact a African American turnout was a record in the state\nAlready them and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones magazine and author of the book give us the ballot the mold and fight the voting rights in America he's not a tool convinced that any of us should be worried about voter fraud I think it's a very small problem and one that has been\nI think that you see cases here are cases there there might be a county ... county\nAddict but the kind of widespread fraud where president Donald Trump says three million people have voted illegally that just doesn't occur and so I\nI think there has been a pretty committed movement of people on the conservative Republican side of the aisle who have exaggerated this threat for political purposes and had made it seem a much more widespread in severe than it actually is\nBut if you accept as a problem with voter fraud even if it's possible and spread out so what do you need to do something about it\nI think it's a very very very small problem and there are targeting solutions to the problem but I think rewriting all of American election laws is not a targeted solution a lot more people have been prevented from voting than fraudulent votes cast\nThat there are many many more people that are being blocked from the polls that have voted illegally and I think you have to scrutinize all of those cases very clearly to see if if there was actually\nFraud and and there's been a lot of really wild claims that had been made by people like ... so the bigger problem is that a lot of people can't participate in the election or choose not to or to sway from participating because of barriers that have been erected ...\nTo the ballot box ... evidence you have that they actually do\nI think there's been a lot of studies there's been um numerous studies that have found for example that\nVoter ID laws reduced voter turnout and that they reduce voter turnout most sharply among young voters first time voters voters of color these are studies that have been done by academics\nIn states like Wisconsin these are studies that have been done nationally by government agencies and places like Kansas and Tennessee I think if you look at the intent\nOf Republicans have claimed on many different occasions that these laws have helped them politically ended up helping carry key swing states like Wisconsin for example I and\nI I think it also just makes sense that you know if you reduce people's access to the process that your people that are going to participate\nBut also the last election in North Carolina the state board of elections did ... castle review and they found ... five hundred cases of people voting you shouldn't have that evidence of vote to froze I asked Ari\nYou look at the case then from there were uncovered most of the time they weren't ex felons who didn't realize they were in eligible to vote there are people that had already served their time and they were on probation or parole and they thought they were eligible to vote when they cast a ballot\nAbout potentially a facing ... years in jail a steep fines all for one vote and most people would not do that if they knew what the penalties would be\nMost of those extra lose didn't in the end face any further action box in elements county twelve people were prosecuted and they soon became known as the elements twelve\nMe can roaches was one that's going on for this program the dark side to American democracy here on BBC will service she agreed to meet me she was setting up the bomb in Greensboro where she works\nGreen or old woman uh\nI was on probation so at that time I wasn't aware that it made me an eligible to vote because no one that told me that\nHad I known I was breaking the law\nYou know made any move to go vote I would've just [noise]\nTo tell me what happened off the elections\nWell after the election um I guess a year so fast and after I got off work one day I came\nHome to a note on my door stating that I had a wife from Iraq so I contacted the Adams County sheriff's department and they and for me that I had a warrant for felonies voting\nAnd the lady kind of was shocked when I talked on the phone how your cases brought her bigger picture which is about thirty to fruit for some people who look as you say you were trying to sway the electro fifth to what you said to them\nI don't think ending twenty four months of my life away from my home my job I my kids is worth me voting you know again if I Would have known that I was not able to vote I Would not have broken the law and decided to vote any way not blatantly\nNow there's an election coming up in November\nWhat's your situation now you've taken history do are you on probation oh no\nI Am actually offered probation free clean and clear no trouble you know all of that behind me you know what I mean so and it was the highly at that point so\nNow I don't want to vote anymore\nI'm a law abiding citizen and that's

route to um you know express their love of the president with signs and with make America great again hats\nSo so even the local population they were divided about ... about the visit tell me more about these protests well\nThere were some protests of course I didn't get to be in the middle of the protests are actually from the motorcade route you couldn't really tell honestly the protests were even going on and they chose a very interesting a route to travel to the city but\nShortly before Mr Trump arrived at a synagogue a there was a crowd that gathered a very close by to a tree of life on traffic slowed down\nSome of the marchers and the marchers were um you know yelling things like I don't want to be here for Trump were burying our friends and they were holding signs they were uh you
