standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nThat we hear from someone in favor of affirmative action in the moment but first the testimony of one student Kelly civil\nI come from an Asian American background I'm a student at Harvard and I think actually the ... tennis university and that's a ... I Hope many other Asian Americans will have to come I think that when you look at the case here of affirmative action\nWe shouldn't just be looking at whether or not affirmative action is right or wrong but sort of how affirmative action is impacting different communities and so the point of affirmative action has been to support communities that has historically than underrepresented are excluded it seems like it's found Asian Americans right now as it looks like Harvard\nAdmissions policies are discriminating against Asian Americans systematically keeping that embrace lower\nIt's hard to say what my personal file looks like a sort of how it affected me but I think the interesting thing is to look at it on the aggregate and how the Asian American population has been increasing in America rapidly but the amount of Asian and Iraq and admitted to Harvard has been saying around the same response I hadn't yes\nSo they have the idea that the students don't mind that speak to Gregory Davis who's a grad student at Harvard or an who's in favor of the affirmative action as it stands Gregory thanks for coming on what's your reaction when you hear arguments such as those just made by Kenny ...\nUm is about ... uh her stance makes a lot of sense and I am happiness she's here um but I think she's mistaken about what the point of affirmative action is the point of affirmative action is not as she says to\nMake a underrepresented groups uh be more pressing the point of affirmative\nAction is to increase diversity and increase the benefits of diversity one\nThing that's been that's been talked about as much in\nThis lawsuit is what it means to have a critical mass here at Harvard and many other colleges and universities across the country there are a critical masses isn't quite frankly Asian students um don't have to walk on campus I feel like they're necessarily represent because of the group um or that they have to speak for every person from their background\nUm this is particularly true of Chinese\nUm students are are students have Chinese background however for African Americans for Latino Americans for indigenous Americans is is not so this is simply not\nSo you're saying that even ways affirmative action\nMost areas of higher education I mean you just tell us about your experience but just before you were at Harvard you you were UCLA and\nOne of the complications to this fact is is that in California as soon as you mentioned isn't allowed so what was the effect on the view of walking into class being one of the very few African Americans I presume ... that's how you felt\nOh absolutely and it was the case um I enter into a class of about two hundred and fifty are entering law students and I was one of\nTwelve African Americans um this is and the state of California which\nIs as much more than just a four percent uh for me I was three or four percent African American and Mrs in an environment in which I was you know in classes debating highly intellectual and highly social issues that involve things like race um in history\nAnd I was one of two African American men in the room this how the huge effect on my ability to um to judge the issues to be able to voice my opinion without feeling like I was speaking on behalf of everyone\nI Know that sort of becomes it becomes personalized it becomes emotional and of course what you'll you'll get to study principles and argue about\nA sort of intellectual facts are without being muddied in that way [noise]\nI Wish that was the case yeah unfortunately it very rarely happened that\nWay but for example in your class was than not one or two Asian or a Chinese and Marilyn how did we should defined them or have they all ready managed to establish numbers in the education system that means that they have support and critical mass of that kind\nI Believe they do now this is not to say that there are underrepresented sub groups within an Asian Americans are among the movies\nAs a Southeast Asia and Pacific Islanders students I absolutely underrepresented um an all facets of higher education but if we're going to talk about Asian Americans as a as a general group\nUm they're representing well both at schools that don't practice affirmative action in I argue schools that do and why would that be I think it has a lot to do with the caliber students applying um the number of students applying\nUm and what did they decide to activate the applications are obviously I I think it makes a lot of sense that a lot of Asian Americans didn't apply to harbor um one interesting fact about this entire lawsuit that is not discussed as much as that I'm twenty two percent of the ...\nI'm roughly is Asian American but also twenty two percent of the application cool it's Asian every year\nWell there you up affirmative action two sides of the student argument is document that or is being taken to the court case or taking to coach a against Harvard University at the moment I should say is a little bit of background in this um many places um and you had that for example California actually bans affirmative action\nBut ... as a private institution or because of the state level and under its own a constitution decides that they want to do that that's why they go ahead and do\nThis if it's a private institution that they can make that goes on you know\nUnless you have to be in a state where you can have affirmative action uh and uh many people are interpreting this is a really significant court cases\nOver the legality of affirmative action in many of the city is not just in the academic sphere and I'm a there's lots of accusations about who's on behalf of whom and who's wearing a tool divided along sort of community ah backgrounds no one's

Lewis can know for the smallest foot to have multi my for the law just ... prizes will be awarded today for the narrowest ladies waist and the biggest knows\n[laughter] so it would seem to promote his victim now a century on from when cross wrote there's not much has changed when it comes to trivia and celebrity typical capital and in what seems like a perfect remark on the ease with which journalists politicians all business people mixed facts and ...\nThe ... of those that can be invented ... controversial pronouncements lead by politicians that truth is not really truth comes in lines yeah\nAnd one can only imagine well he just thought through social media and the Internet today that cross was very focused not just on particular issues and misuse of facts but also on sloppy language now tell me why was this so important to him he was he just being a president\nIt's a complicated question as in many issues when it comes to cross um I think that it's important to say that there's a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic pure as someone who only sought models of language and figures like Shakespeare to ensure there are many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing from early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then it's just pure swell and I think that um the image is as a misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand crosses views on language\nI'm In its relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it simply cross saw language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so if one wrote slop ally and I think are writing ... many things that could mean\nNot including a combat due to editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability or to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and thought coke constitute their co form one another\nThis for cross was all an indication that there was something deeply a riot and the morality of the author or more likely\nThat one could say the morality of the society in which such language could be received and produced so critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate when I'm Talking about one of cross as more humorous pieces are set of pieces is what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries man by the name of ... million heart and\nCross calls this piece Esperanto a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consists of multiple pages of hardens excessively floor pros juxtapose then against Kraus his\nSo called translations of these phrases into more accessible direct language and cross does this I take it that what he's doing is he's exposing some of the ideological underpinnings that are in heart in language but that has language actually obscures and so this has kind of one example of how cross seeks to relate sloppy language\nFailure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSo by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally bad grammar wherever he's talking about more than that and they\nHave yeah and he's on schools are funded delusions two classic works of German ... on Shakespeare as you said and he also continued the bullying tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich they should be short pithy often surprising and funny expressions of a truce or principle you've heard a few these already and ... started including them in ... from about Nineteen oh six and late to publish them in book for several times\nBut he himself was also aware of the limitations\nAnd I ... never coincides with the tricks it is either a half truth old woman to half truths\nThat Vienna also had a prestigious fits that tradition something that I think was particularly important to crash in fact throughout his life he gave hundreds of one man shows it's only Katrina why was that it's so important to him\nWhen I think I had to really ambivalent relationship to the U.S yet that he wanted to become an actor at first that didn't work out and and he very much disliked modern development for instance I'm\nThe director max Reinhardt who is very famous that caused this time in Germany especially um he developed they on a mental showy um productions\nAnd contrary to cross the kind of embrace that yeah trickle splendor\nBut what crossed imagined or was it ... just the stage for the spoken good and not to edit pieces to shorten them and and make room for for the stage but to really stay with the drama uh itself and nothing else\n[noise] so the picture on getting of crass than is before the first World War it was someone who is surrounded by lots of colleagues fellow office\nFriends and someone but at the same time he's a bit of an outside or which which is probably other choice some punt the out of circumstance I mean this is fascinating psychologically I mean I read that he feels like a double outside in Vienna because he was born\nIn a small town in what is now the Czech Republic and ... and be full of and also because he was Jewish\nI think ah to kind of reiterate one of the moms points he he despise the idea of being associated with any particular group or be that ethnic religious political um I think that he saw dangers in complete media you know absorbing oneself and those collective identities and\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nIt's partially explains also crosses lifelong I Would say very deeply ambivalent attitude toward his own relationship maybe you'd better said to his own\nJewish identity um but just to give another camp across as thoroughly booth law but his sympathies in his early life lay with the aristocracy and then as he became more politicized much more so with the working class so and sometimes never with the class to which he\nI'm officially belong Americans is is one example of saying crosses outsider status at work\nFor all his public pronouncements cross was ... months and kept his personal life to himself but we do know that is great love listed the ... not hung up about ... and patron of the ... based in a small shot so about a hundred miles south of crossers but in what is now the Czech Republic\nI'm the only country in the ... what was the relationship like\nI was first and foremost it had to be a secret relationship um they met in Nineteen Thirteen one yeah before the war and as he didn't he now Daniel CD as he called her she inspired class to write poetry\nAnd he also wrote 'em over a thousand lettuce to hurt you and the closest relationship the relationship lasted with interruptions until his death\nAnd maybe it's especially noteworthy that crust he had his hands full with a his work you just mentioned that a nine hundred and twenty two issues of ... and I didn't see that Danny's case uh he really sat down and wrote like every other day and very level data\nHer lettuce to him my last um we don't have them\nBut we know from his letters that he shows are very different kinds of personality and in them he's really love the I think he would have wanted to marry her she would not\nShe

think of the reasons why he did not publish this text that he called the ... book is knocked food will ... is not so one reason is that he did not want to harm the people that he mentioned a end\nHe

volunteers campus votes we get the view of the wise old man of the Republican Party how do full term congressman and to tell the mayor of Omaha he says the bacon Eastman contest has national implications\nSo think about this race for the house easier as a bellwether indicator not only of how things are now\nHow they may be drifting\nOver the next two years seems to me that if done baking the Republican nominee winds here\nThat will be a signal that the composition of the voter be that Republican Democrat male or female rural or\nUrban or suburban\nIs still leaning\nObjectively moderately to the right\nWith the race at all as I Am at this point in time or\nOn the doorstep congressman seems to be winning hearts and minds ... votes but would it be enough for victory when the broadly conservative state like Nebraska send the progressive punk band to Washington a question for this the poll says she's just spoken to that don't ...\nI Believe that there is potential for our movement based on current political standings I maybe I should say I hope versus I Believe\nProbably rather than belief without a democratic votes will only or spoke to Roseanne morning she's political reporter with the Omaha will Harold she told me that this race is shaping up to me the most expensive one this congressional swing district has ever seen at the moment she says the funding momentum seems to be with Kara Eastman\nEastern raise one point five million dollars in the last three months that triples what she had the four and she got a lot of money from\nIndividuals as opposed to committees are groups are companies or whatever and and it's from all across the country she's become it shows that she's become this kind of figure head and progressive\nAnd does that mean that this rice and this one district does as we had the\nTom this bellwether for how the Democratic party use is running and where it is going\nYet so the um progress in groups that want to prove they can win in swing districts are looking to this state she is one of the one of the only ones that this kind of new crop of leaders that in\nA conservative area so if she can win here you're going to see a lot more progressive trying to make the case in other swing districts that they can win and then they should get national support because look parties and did it\nIs there's something about what's happening in Omaha Nebraska has brought to to the top and the Democratic party or is it simply a a national picture\nSo the demographics of Omaha haven't changed all that much but I Do think that this is the year for progressive and you're seeing that here as well as elsewhere to ... we had progressive in Omaha\nBefore um but they never had a candidate to rally around like this and a lot of her policies are becoming kind of mainstream democratic principles and so you're seeing and she she has more opportunities this year than she would have previously\nNow we're talking about mid some elections which don't generally get huge turnout so I'm not going to be cage of this so she's got some money she's got a bit of momentum she'd go energy nationwide but will not necessarily translate into votes so that's a good\nQuestion so her whole hypothesis is that she needs to give voter that Democrats in Nebraska should give voters a reason to be excited and then they'll show up on they haven't shown on previously for the more moderate\nShe's doing a lot of door knocking and hurt and she's doing a lot of outreach to voters directly because her whole strategy is trying to turn out the boats\nAnd you don't see many of us had dumb bacon is sizzling bacon I vote but he ... he said on the TV every often up but you don't see her\nShe she does have some ads she's not focusing on it as much you might see more ads from her because she got that one point two five million on but she also it's been a lot of her money on voter outreach which isn't the traditional typical path they take\nUm what about the Trump ... how does how does he play into this race in this study so\nTrump um came here and spoke and bacon spoke on stage with him on\nRight now it seems that cabin his nomination of cabinet in particular is actually turning on both sides so Democrats are really mad about cabinet but you're also seeing Republicans mad about how Democrats handled it and one thing that I'm hearing a lot from Republican women is that\nThey are upset that liberal women have kind of been speaking for all\nWhat the the ... these other women say that we are [noise]\nThat was Roseanne
