that the have been serious violations of the treaty by Russia but equally the Russians think that aspect of the United states and NATO posture in Europe and the deployment of missiles in Europe has an

been a disastrous war for Saudi Arabia since it began when the Saudis originally announced their bombing campaign that was back in March of twenty Fifteen\nThey announced it was going to be a short sharp campaign to restore the internationally recognized government of president ...\nWell that's turned out to be anything but true by\nOne estimate there have been airstrikes carried out by the Saudi led coalition in Yemen every Ninety minutes since then on the impact has been absolutely devastating in terms of the loss of civilian life in terms of the damage to infrastructure\nBut also I Would say in terms of the grave damage to Saudi Arabia's international reputation\nAnd the longer the conflict has gone on the more instances have been identified by the un of civilian targets being

I hadn't been in Sana'a the capital in two years\nAnd it was really shocking to see how much things have deteriorated there has been a massive cholera epidemic the largest recorded in the world and ... nutrition rights have soared there are four hundred thousand children in Yemen now who are severely acutely malnourished\nOn during our trip we met the un humanitarian coordinator for Yemen leaves ground day and she was very very\nBlunt on star in her warning that up to fourteen million people could be suffering famine within a few months if there is no political solution none of us are he isn't one on the horizon\nWill solve the agency's able to do with the momentum looked as they think needs to happen now\nI mean one thing you hear from the aid agencies on from Yemeni doctors and indeed Yemeni civilians the messages is really the same from every one of its end the conflict what we need is the end of the conflict on the great fear is around the red sea port of a data that's in the hands of the who the rebels there has been an offensive since about June\nBy the Saudi led coalition on on the various forces that support the government of Yemen the un and the ... these are desperately concerned that any attempt that results and fighting and the port would be catastrophic\nBecause today to really as a lifeline about eighty percent of Yemen's age food supplies fuel medicine was coming in through her day to\nThe UN is managing to operate their other organizations like save the children and so on they need permission from the two sides it's not always easy to get their operations are controlled unlimited\nBut undoubtedly it is the operation of of the aid agencies that have been keeping so many Yemen he's alive during the years of this conflict\nOn the air and the U.S is warming so rapidly that most experts agree that measures need to be taken suck carbon dioxide out to the atmosphere to avoid the worst consequences of climate change\nBurning fossil fuels for energy clearing forest some demotion wetlands old contribute to the problem [noise] CO two stops heat from leaving the planet one reason\nThan it used to be scientists in the U.S now say that some technology able to capture compromise is ready to be deployed on a large scale right now [noise] so is this a solution to climate change I asked our environment correspondent across\nThe problem with these techniques that they talked about here is that nobody's retry them yet because there's no real financial incentive to do them but on the basis of the calculations up these scientists and others have done they are talking about the fact that by the middle of the century we need to be removing about twenty billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year\nAnd that some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told and everybody did have some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer technologies that are coming on there you know we're talking about planting trees and changing farming practices the brothers would be boring things the more ... and do things where you've got these machines that looked like washing machines with fans in the ... of the year\nThey can do that right now they cost about six hundred dollars a ton of carbon that they remove but the report's authors are actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we think about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a ton if they do that\nThat's a very successful and we could beat this problem the big problem with that is this what they philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove comments atmosphere why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers that politicians and campaign has environmental is really worry about because if people think there's gonna be a solution ten years down the track they'll keep flying they'll keep eating meat to keep driving cars they do all the things that are contributing to the problem right now\nTo the extent is common capture happening all ready and how can you make it more appealing\nThere are lots of different things going on at the moment of every country in the world is planting trees pretty much people are trying to change the way that they do far a station that the\nLengthen the time to time the trees grow or they changed you know when they have a massive kilometer you fire or something that we put on pretty quickly the bigger more technical industrial challenge of you know holding on big pieces of technology to coal fired stations\nThey're all they're in theory but very few in practice is literally a handful around the world and the big problem with that because all these big bits of case cost lots of money and nobody really wants to put their hands in the caucus to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report has come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do blue carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshlands near the sea if you can

unless they have clear line of sight into a launch vehicle base of electric vehicles and they know they're going to service and also there's a catch twenty two because people won't buy electric

Brazil told me about this investigation and explain to just how important ... sat has become in Brazil\nLots of is very important the company says a hundred and twenty million people use watts up in Brazil and the population is two hundred and ten million\nIt has become in Brazil almost like a social media and not only an instant messaging app where people participate in groups with people they don't know from around Brazil and chat with them one hypothesis is that this happens\nBecause of how small bio networks offer what's up for free without discounting the Internet data so it's it's a cheap and readily available to and how is it being abused during the present interactions\nSo we found out that there are campaigns that are buying devices that can scrape people's numbers from Facebook and\nThen use these numbers to a target them with lots of messages they can put people in in lots of groups and they can just send the message is individually about candidates or when they put people in lots of groups one market here who I spoke to was\nTold me he would put a person and a group and the group would have a name that is not related to candidates specifically like political debate\nAnd then people would start talking but there were would be to uh people infiltrated from the campaign that will try to leave these people on and make them support the candidate and this is just a little fringe activity or is it an awful lot of this happening\nWhile we can't say for sure how many people are using this but in our report we saw that this has has been used by different candidates in Brazil\nAnd it was up has played a big part in this campaign in Brazil are very big part uh so we have sixty six percent of the voters saying that they have used watts up they use watts up in Brazil and uh the far right candidate presidential candidate said ...\nAh who's come pain is is being played a lot uh in in what is this against Facebook's rooms in any way well it is against

on ... ringing alone bells and they don't seem to be able to do much about it once\nOn this will be learning about is coming from old and she is actually but it got fashionable two years ago for
