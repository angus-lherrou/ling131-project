politics which maybe years ago they didn't they're doing it now if\nThe Democrats win the house [noise]\nThey're gonna just impede\nTalk the whole mission stop what's what's going on raise taxes\nAnd move things forward\nSince you out on a tough to predict the outcome of elections\nPosters and professor Chris boring political science class are busy trying to predict the outcome of the race it's not just the national political environment helping Democrats here but shifts and demographics as well voter registration is way up and new Democrats outnumber Republicans four to one\nNew registrations are usually younger voters and they tend to to break Democrat but in this particular cycle that's accentuated I if the Democrats if these new voters do turn out and\nI could have turned out really does give a boost to the Democrats in a district like the freaking out to voters from ... mile campaign\nAnd the final days of his campaign will come down to which candidate get their message out fast and which party can turn out the air volunteerism wild campaign and we just have knocking on doors [laughter]\nWhich checking in with\nAnother topic reporting unless you had another report the economy healthcare to the key issues for Republicans and Democrats a head of the voting next week\nWell what are the polls say about the issues the uppermost in voters' minds I've been speaking to leave Maryland Gulf director of the modest college poll on to the front of a cruise and independent polling and election consultant first Kathy what issues does she think will help voters make up their minds but I find\nThe most fascinating thing is that the polls suggesting that we have two completely different electorate so Republican electric which is motivated now say they are motivated now by issues like immigration and the Democratic electorate which is focusing on much more traditional bread and butter issues like\nIn particular this year health care that means that\nIt's an election that is operating basically on two separate tracks\nAnd leave what difference might the pipe bombs and the outrage in Pittsburgh the mountain what difference might they make you think\nI I think there's a tone in the closing days of the campaign\nThat can move some of the voters who are on the fence we saw that in the presidential campaign after the combing letter and other things are going on in the last week\nWhere people moved into Donald Trump's direction I think right now this is a kind of issue that ... to talk about in partisan terms is you know unfortunate but\nYou know there is a midterm election and if anything this is not the kind of discussion President Trump would want going into the find a week or a big midterm campaign people are very concerned about what's going on and this affects people's outlook towards the state of the country\nAnd Lee has the Republican Party come to terms with a Trump presidency I mean across the Republican policy\nI think it's interesting because there there there was a note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished I think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes for key legislation\nAt worst they say well you know he's got some odd characters are things that I Wish she didn't talk about so much or read about so much but the agenda I'm really solidly behind there's very few Republicans who are distancing themselves\nWho are facing election right now or reelection from Donald Trump I mean they they are really you're stepping in line to his administration and his presidency\nI was gonna say if I may there is relatively little difference in polling data between people who identify as Republicans and people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump\nIt's not as if one group is any different from the other on in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues from President Trump and while they may not have\nAn opinion that matches his when an issue first emerges after a week or two they do in fact echo the Trump position so we've got Donald Trump effect is leading the party and leading those people who who voted for him two years ago\nOn if I also can add something about ... we've had shootings in the United states we've had a lot of mass shootings over the years\nIt does relatively little in the long run in terms of changing opinion about gun control about what to do about gun violence\nOn there's usually a short term effect but it it dissipates in in us surprisingly short amount of time a week or two so this coming ten days before an election it's sort of hard to see whether or not it's going to have any meaning to voters when they go to the polls on next Tuesday\nUncovered what above Republican women because there are lots of things about what this president is alleged to have done to women and the things he says about women which might average women even if they are loyal to the Republican Party\nSpent a lot of time over the last few weeks looking at the relationship between gender and partisanship and how that affects canyon\nAnd what seems to be the case is that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ\nWhen it came to opinion about Supreme Court justice now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerge and be very distinctive is among those people who identify with\nThe women are very different from independent meant\nYeah and I would add to that uh is clearly more about party than it is about gender with the exception of back critical group of voters and the basis of both parties are pretty much lock stock and barrel behind their party's candidates that leaves these independent voters and especially independent women\nAnd independent women who may be in the living in the suburbs\nWho are the ones who are if there is a swing group that's probably the the group of voters that to zero in on\nWell then let's finish by talking about the Democrats we report quite a lot about changes in the Democratic party I'm much more progressive voices the kind of establishment Clinton nights really losing the influence how do you see that really\nWell I you know [laughter] I think there were a couple of primaries that sort of got some headlines I'm not sure that we have\nAnything that's clear looking ahead to let's say twenty twenty at this point other than there's a lot of mobilization among the Democratic party I don't think the Democrats have necessarily pick sides as to which part of them\nIs going to dominate the process I think they're a unified in their opposition to President Trump to this point\n... if the Democrats take control of the house of representatives um it's very likely that Nancy Pelosi will continue to be\nThe leader of the party in the house and she is certainly identified as one of the old guard on the other hand she's also a woman which is a distinction that may prove valuable in terms of her contest for house speaker if the Democrats taken Trump\nJust a showdown so from each of you or how likely is it for the Democrats will take the house or even the Senate Lee\n[noise] well I think you do that and I suspect cats will agree with you I mean the conventional wisdom maybe right this time I was ... house is like to go democratic and the centers like does the Republican\nIs very likely that the national house vote is going to be clearly in favor of the Democrats but the way districts are drawn that may or may not result in a Democratic majority in the house of representatives\nThe Democrats have a terrible time trying to reach a majority in the Senate just because there are too many vulnerable red state Democrats for on the ballot this year\nThat the that Hillary Clinton carried so the reverse doesn't hold is just that all these Democrats in states Trump carried\nLabor and golf director of the Marist College poll and Kathy Frank of it and then send them holding an election consultant you'll have your own views you might have
