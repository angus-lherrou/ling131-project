buses and everything else around me it's going to need to be ... by renewable\nBut he's not possible that going to do the economy and can we have the kind of ... we've got used to what we have to get used to something else maybe something less dynamic\nWhat does that mean that politics can lead it this way to to make big sacrifices well there is a pretty tough questions that but that's get back to the theater now that I don't\nFind a tunnel is Laura Diaz ... professor of climate change policy at Cambridge University bubbled he's the policy director at the Grantham instituted climate change at the London School of economics\nJulius ... he's an associate professor of an ecological economics at Leeds University I'm Molly Scott K. to amend the of the European Parliament\nFor the u._k. green policy thank you all for joining us before we begin I Want to introduce one more pests and I'm not you rebel he's one of the office of this week's PCC reports and he's with me here in the studio\nYou read the report cool for the well to aim to keep the rise in global temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to comment to price\nIs the world's on track to teach anything like that target festival\nTo clarify the record doesn't call for anything the report also is a question that the government has asked do you see\nIn two thousand Fifteen independents agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was no safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference wants between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warming to one point five and noticed report\nClearly shows that there is an important difference between warming if one point five and two degree and also shows the means and the reason rich global warming can be limited to that level\nAnd so just to be clear is the well I'm trying to do anything like that there to report as those were\nCurrently the pledges of the countries that they have submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions overtime and two twenty thirty whereas in mission should be decreasing very very steeply a by twenty thirty\nSaid paint the picture wolf saw the consequences if temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nThose short flights being possible using ... technology supports same wave law a long distance trucking Jones\nEasing that slightly I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to buy specific technologies but I think we're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels it's currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energies and\nEvery kilowatt hour every message will is among those is going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys fine\nNo everybody but the people that I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that they're actually putting things into you know five flying is one of the most environmentally damaging DVDs one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that\nSaw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that to people especially at the so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable live how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible Simon I'm American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in the life of deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker\nA more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly because you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are often outside the city center so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality the laws they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design of well but there's both lowering our missions and one in which people's living standards Ohio\nLewis is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in the sense that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nThink here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say\nBe loosing from from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to ten but some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause that's an equate long term costs the I'll give you some examples we know that the increase of seeing an extra seat the\nPrice of things that you can get another country and in other countries have hurt the most a low income people for a larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no do says what we can say that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor these short term law office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of garments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the fossil fuel industries\nYou know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've\nAre emerging of these other high technology sectors that were saying it may be the case I think the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to me to get these short\nTerm ... cases if I can just bring you about it from a ... year he was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the transition was a massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition to we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effective views greens working on European policy so you know for example I work from the sustainable finance area we can say the\n... financial products ... pension products have to be aligned with one point five powers target for example I can see that and I'm In the ... support for that were previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and they mentioned the world\nAnd they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes now\nYou know it just went to uh to does the when asking the question who is going to pay to for this when we should not see this as a luxury something that we do know because otherwise we could just go on the business as usual project wants\nTo just reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and when asking the question we're going to\nPay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question what was going to pay for ... for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already returned observing today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree of warming\nAnd ... to a degree of forming this is not in the far future this is um one point five up the current level of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who's going to pay for ducked\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing managed so ducked the issue the poor of the impact of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and entering a real welfare law where he wants to come back and\nAnd I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have a nine to nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries with\nAuctions fifty eight countries that are the ... and thanks to all these work over the past five years or so we've seen cost the cost of mitigation coming down significantly so he does making it easier reason to global carbon price for instance the agrees no but ... is that what do we need and\nI mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's\nPolitically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have\nTo realize that there's been um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which have traditionally been\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications on countries on the patient they're beginning to be competitive so it's these investments ... it is changing and that's the only said\nAgain we are doing and we have been doing it it's not enough ah as they say the report is reminding us okay um but I I Do think this points out he's made us\nThat the most vulnerable or not it's not just necessary for ethical sense but it's also necessary for political resent that only in that situation do you get the support you need the help\nYeah so when we talk about coffee is important that we remember the global economy is not static and there are three big trends that going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty cents even down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in\nThe next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double Ninety Chilean will be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we might the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the\nGlobal economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of\nAbout three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next four years they are trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our current growth model which was delivering US cities the dock congested polluted unpleasant places debate nope productive\nOr we designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing to make investments in a more sustainable economy rather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast the now think heat a panel throughout the as an adult ... case and\nAnd you eat the gal will tell you a short break ... just to remind you let us know what you think of the program or any ideas to topics you'd like us to look into you can email us that the real story at BBC ... ... e K will treat me at ... and if you enjoy\nThe program we have the podcast you can subscribe to just set for the real story and you'll ... cost ...\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the United states is made possible by American public media\nWith support from their providing global financial resources and market expertise declined the world over\nOne of the world's nuclear energy reporter for this year's shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind about forty five donors and make a little time and no one should win the twins who does it make it was ...\nI think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars maybe we'll tone that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economics so\nNuclear just cannot compete with renewables in what we need to do is is electric bio energy supply and make it a low carbon as quickly as possible and most efficient and cheapest way to do that through a new bills\nSo when somebody will and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another\nMany within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them watching from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations about his level\nBut I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis so they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and it uses science to argue for the fact that use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for weaker\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view as they have a view on staying in the pocket of the hospital industry and um automotive industry\nFull board wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the government's not approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not decided that it is something but the American government has signed up to\nSee how that how do you decide to date and of course that's true how do you desegregate that from if you like the public statement\nIf the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from power as there was a huge response from states and cities some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives his reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states the colon stunning United States has been long term decline because it's simply cheap to generate power from other forces such us shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut he's in the ... the facts are becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she said olds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including coal mining industry um we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is part of coming up the solution here\nBut the uh the other thing is I I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is big up because of sea level rise and there's a good chance that the warmer than average waters and the goals well partly puma because of climate change I think people have say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the u._s. hasn't gone we've this has been in the support for innovation low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut my sixty percent by fifty percent some programs to see her all at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nIn low carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies\nAre actually something that uh brings bipartisan support we've talked a lot about\nWell let's turn if we may to post the world that a growing I won't speak to treat the good he's a professor of environment and development in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joined us today from Cairo's streets I won't talk about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\nFast but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly serious the just described to some of the changes that are on the way\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies me already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then if it if\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda there's much more to talk about renewables but at the same time maybe just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that I have been studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have huge savings in health\nAnd so that itself could be a reason for taking action on a fossil fuel and doesn't this come back\nTo the politics because then the cost Indian governments have argued that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't part of the industrialization prices that if you like caused the problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay her in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beaded Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five at that time the developing countries are doing the knock must take action fist\nNot it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to save it going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to bypass the mistakes\nThe fact that we could ... tried to convince off ancient funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or the investments to the south and I think that for the very good idea just shooting the problem is that right and so I don't even developing country should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to bite off that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic destruction do you think for a country like India that democratic that this is\nMore difficult or easier to push through as an idea [noise]\nThe problem with democracy is a false is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to this is ... ... relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand\nI think that there is a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd I think that if you can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains and that's really going to lead to major challenges of the mountains stock to melt the snow soft him as in the mountains\nAnd so I have a consequences if you just try to look at\nThe agricultural sector in India the coastal sect in India they will

faced on a movie set ten years ago\nWhen I interviewed her a few days back she told me the incident cause has so much trauma that she left the movies she says she filed a police complains back in two thousand and eight but nothing happened\nThe act to she's accused is a senior figure in the film industry he's denied the allegations and has said he's looking at legal options\nBut the fact that a woman was willing to take on an influential man seems to have a boat and others to share their own experiences we don't have just seen the Brett Kavanaugh and lazy forward story play out in the U.S\nSome of the accountant in women have shed awesome yes even decades ago but the anger seems to still be fresh\nAnd for the first time we've seen consequences\nA few journalists have been forced to resign and many news organizations have initiated inquiries against employees who've been named\nA major Bollywood studio has been to spend a comedy show has been dropped by video streaming platform a big bully Woodstock has refused to work with the director who's been accused of sexual harassment\nIndia's new that has killed on a buddy of ... says have both sent out strong statements urging companies to take action when necessary\nYet so far this storm seems to be largely limited to the media and entertainment industries which not only have more female employees than most other sectors in India but they're also known to have more outspoken women\nPretty much all the stories we've had in the past few days have come from women living in India cities because yeah there's more awareness and better access to platforms like social media\nSo far the me too stolen hasn't even touched smaller towns or rude really India\nBut as a glimmer of hope that even if only us\nAt least it's a stopped somehow feeling triumphant that men guilty of sexual harassment must be sending sleepless nights wondering when they might be called out\nOf course there's also a worry that in this bus no testimony let frenzy innocent men might also find themselves being publicly maligned even before they have a chance to defend themselves\nAs a journalist covering the story the last week history get so many memories over the years a silence code has been formed between female reporters if we posted a colleague getting stuck in a conversation with a lecture itself is a we would find a way to pull her out\nThere are politicians we would only go to meet in groups because of that inappropriate behavior\nMany of these stories would remain I'm too old\nFor women in India the boss week has been both get toxic and deeply painful\nYou ... to ... that's it from the well this week for now I don't forget to join us at the same time next week for look back at what happened next seven days\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change has come out with a special\nReport about one point five degrees of warming so one thing is all these protections are against a changing global climate was presumably you've ...\nIt is that if you were to implement all those options that we analyzed and hopefully we could avoid dangerous levels of climate change we know if that were not to happen then for example we could expect reduction in yields yet other changes in diet of people that might make them an healthier\nAnd also it might be harder to really implement some of the adaptation measures like building I dance and all that that would be needed to protect yourself from the impact of climate change\nWould be protected might be an underestimate actually marker spring been from the Oxford marks in program on the future of food\nRenewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming was looking for any source of electrical power that doesn't put fear to into the atmosphere I think really false making a cool ... will generational ready and moving to a third by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University's David Keith backs solar power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power\nSuggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he took me through his logic\nFundamentally is to do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and\nSome of the simplest ways to think about wind turbines think about every winter buys being independent from every other stuff you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just\nThink of how much power I went to the next and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent in the end the atmosphere is one big heat edge in it's driven by power from the sun and that power as always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take and you see from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite the arguments are most\nA that's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so\nOf the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third of ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest is heat and the energy of evaporated water so that direct consequences at that point three percent is almost irrelevant\nBut it's indirect consequences huge because of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct just a patient that energy and the wins that matters that's hardly important\nWhat matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heated momentum and that in turn can redistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate consequence so\nEffectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind farm might be all said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a wind farm says at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because\nThrough this because you don't get a cooling effect to the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil will motives that it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night wind turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nAnd especially at night when the atmosphere is quite stratified when you have warmer airline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to warm the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then the biggest effect is at night yes how most of an effect on me I can understand that too you know that could be a bit of a tweet came but that wouldn't be with publishing well I mean\nThe effects in the region were large wind farms are seem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degree centigrade or a little bit more something like that\nBut the issue really is how to think about the benefits compared to the harm so wind turbines are immensely better than coal and we have to ... energy system this is all about choices we make as we do carbon eyes\nI suppose what I'm saying is one wouldn't phone on a global scale either I'm supposed to have a bigger thing you'll modeling is the last numbers of wood and phones\nYeah but one wind farm doesn't have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs that's not nice trip for wind power is true for any kind of interesting\nSo one wind turbine does a very infinitesimal amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduces climate change over the whole next century over the whole world that one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs this just slightly dancing the benefits of wind farms or what you know it's all together\nI don't think it wipes out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution in packs\nAnd given the very long time scale of of seemed to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon when power but I think it's important that the community began to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we do carbon eyes\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density is a winter brown a race basically how much power you get from a single square kilometer of land with wind turbines and people have suggested it's a very large numbers\nAmateur we've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet\nAnd we get a number it's more like half a watt per square meter and that's you know a factor of\nBetween a few and even ten times less than ... important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWell less important because I Know that you were very interested in some of the power and I believe that the ... ... square me to you can get from solar power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more was per square meter and that sounds like a very

that they have these specialized ... called ... and I'll tears are basically the fly equivalent of your inner ear of the stimulus them so they use them for balance\nAnd five can't fly if they don't have their health care so one thing you can do is actually removed the healthcare trust lie and they can still take off but once they're airborne they just lose complete control culture the air and crash\nSo that's not new information the first time someone did that experiment was in Seventeen fourteen I think about what we didn't know how the hell chairs actually works but what information where the hell chairs providing to the fly\nTo an artist here that out what I did with the record from the whole ... and I found that the timing\nOf single bike with different when I recorded the hulk here and you're out in a position that stimulated street flight versus when I recorded\nWhile the health care was in a position that simulated a fly rotating so basically my data showed that if I can

vision and the reason they use these are there more reflective behavior just because it's much faster than bitch until it's kind of like they can immediately detect a rotation and correct it really quickly\nWhat's important about this bonding\nImportant for us because this research has shown away and that complex aspect of an animal's environment can be broken down into the timing of a single spike\nSo this is how our brains initially represent information in the world trade single spikes anything on there on every thought and experience you've ever had that can be broken down into the activity of these individual neurons and Pfizer no different just seem to be here to study fly because they have a lot fewer neurons than a human one\nWhat will it mean for for humans this information\nWider than human neurons work exactly the same way\nSo it certainly helps us to understand how different organisms sensory systems work in order to understand our own\nBut there's also more immediate applications for this type of research that one example would be flight technology wise it had millions of years to evolve fast and efficient mechanisms for flying so if we can figure out how they do it we can use some of the same techniques to build our own bio inspired technologies\nA hundred yoga and now before we both here in the news room ... mind to all of our main news at
