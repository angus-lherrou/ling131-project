hit\nSingle coming into the sex scene what James Brown would have thought of today's world\nIn which sex machines were actually available to buy is anyone's guess do you see the link or he might have been intrigued by the fact that sex robot Brussels have popped up in some cities on this subject it's fair to say that science fiction films\nHaven't inspired optimism from the Nineteen seventies the step for wives where ambitious women are transformed into do style husband pleasing automate and more recently the British movie ... which are female robot stabbed so the city is create to the city is having use that word for a while to death\nSo robots are going profoundly to change our lives and all sorts of ways but how will they affect all sexual behavior\nChildren after the room and slides health warning Kate Devlin is a senior lecturer in digital humanities at London universities King's College and she has the answer to everything you've ever wanted to know about sex robots but were afraid to ask a new book\nIs called toned on science sects and robots and she joins us in the studio welcome Kate morning are quite positive about sex robots aren't you\nWell it away I mean I think there is potential for technology to help us with relationships to help us with intimacy on to bring pleasure to people but whether or not comes in the form of the ... is another story what all the color insects robo there's really no to any\nReading it we kind of have one in prototype that ... to ship to customers anytime no I really and it's essentially a sex older love till\nI'm with an animatronic hats or how does your wife it's so different from a blowup love a wouldn't say blow up the things that quite expensive um they ... up with so [laughter]\nIt's probably upwards a little too much too early ... dies of dollars up words to buy one of these robots um five thousand dollars up with a few just wanting adult version made out of silicon\nThey are um sculpted they are they are kind of think it works of art and but they don't look anything like humans rated\nOkay we're going to dispel a few minutes in a moment what do you make of the concept Chitra very briefly of the sex robots before we go on\nI find that really striking that human beings can do all kinds of things with technology and this is why we put a s\nSex robots kind of feel Kate and you know divorcing the sexual act entirely from feeling comes with risks or does it\nI I don't think it necessarily ... we know that sex toys for example have been around for hundreds if not thousands of years the difference here is that the current form of the ... is a humanoid form that's that's the problem because it tends to be a very productive stereotype of female body\n... and that's the problem why are we talking just about the female body ... robots for women on the sex robots for gay women\nKnow that we're not yet there are not yet at this at a male version of a sex or will it tends to be I'm straight men that are buying the robots that doesn't\n... because on most sex toys build those which suggests that the the classic lead on would be a you know bill do based sex ...\nSo essentially the something else here and I think there's two streams what the two lines of development one is the sex toy like you say this is the things like Elizabeth I breeders around for years and the other is the sex to all the sexual has always been a fan in the market for manned\nOkay entitlement and some men in in sexual terms you know this is an area that brings huge alarm bells\nUm the compliance ever willing female figure is in policy isn't it in the form of the passive sect stole which takes what he's given to it it it it's offensive to many people on all sorts of levels\nAbsolutely I Am not something we'd be fed by sigh fight on the air is as well and of course which always the hinges on a dystopian plot where the the woman gets about ... and uh the female robots or takes over it as a threat to the mountains I think there's a\nCertain power levels is with real life than not fear [noise] um but yes it is it's just this past the female form that we have and I I ... maybe the wife not because we have technology that could do wonderful things in terms of\nHelping relationships them in terms of bringing pleasure and it doesn't have to be in this form\nIt's open field for questions Matthew I'm kinda nervous the venture into this month we'll have to admit pool when I saw that this was going to be a topic of discussion it just before I let you in the morning but K I ever don't shy away you know I've I've noticed that my mom has raised sitting it\nBecame ... can you tell us how you go into this topic what drew you to this you know I wanted to ask that question but I thought it was to route\nWell I mean it's a fascinating subject area um it came about rainy from a sitting up in the pub after conference will come to the systems talking with her for calling\nSymptoms that 'cause I think why or why why repeal this effort into creating a ice that half human like traits we have very specific traits that changed the way we think and sexuality is one of those it affects how we how we ...\nIt's we've kind of a fundamental driver to humans because the the whole point is whether we like or not we want to replicate our our genes Chitra [noise] yes\nI mean we've touched on this slightly already by one in ... I Want to explore more are we not worried about what six robots would mean for human sexuality\nParticularly given that as we mentioned already designed by men Forman says Gen did straight men\nWhat are the implications for women especially when it comes to attitudes about an agency consent and lights and and also a link to that is not perfect analogy but when you look at pornography\nThat particular racial stereotypes um that uh uh put forward and pornography as well and I'm just wondering about I guess the the race and gender implications of a move towards um sex robots I left the Yale ideas Kate\nYeah that's right I think it's very problematic at the moment it's very much a a male straight while I'm ...\nI'm a last word has heard norm of time so the idea that people um are in relationships are straight on on monogamous and I'm featured in this case um it's it's a mom and a woman and it's it's um sex evils of China [noise]\nUm I think that that sounded problem I think um we know that the ... the ... that we have today old tend to be in this um\nSalmon I type of sexual form and they all tend to be why does rile on whether they aren't where there there are it's all the different skin color they are as you say they're kinda because all sized\nUm this is problematic and and I think that we do have to really address stop and look at new ways of doing these things I'm just a check or\nAre we at the technological stage of development where robots can really accurately imitates a ... not stop the other problem we're very very bad at making human like robots words ... how\nSexy can they possibly be wow ... ... it's quite a big ... and I think it will stay incredibly nice for quite some time\nWe can can you know integrate virtual reality now these they I mean showing the technology is changing so quickly that also official intelligence as hyper realistic ... I mean the ... or at least a robot can talk to you convince me not somebody so they these are not in the mood give you a bit [laughter] and it's ... these robots\nThere are being developed that you can carry around just starting to load up on your phone topics you can have a virtual girlfriend and your phone they're working on a a meal version as well partly um so I think that's that's probably a more realistic convincing human than any rowboat\nWhat's being reception fuel bookcase oh sorry Troy quick point realize you're not going to\nSay just hearing you Kate makes me I'm wonder why people need but she'll go for it and whether it is is this does it say something about who got boyfriends and girlfriends don't let me let's be honest it's not boyfriends it's such a good friends that were talking about and does this say something about masculinity\nI'm In an era that you would rather have a vet she'll go fund who doesn't it's not a real human being with her own ideas and saw\nBig ... I don't know how they just ... yeah I think that's there's probably less and I think ... sort of talked about the idea that women are the emotional gatekeepers us so we of course you know we are able to go out there and and bomb socially but perhaps men have more problems with\nA K Devlin author of toned down south science sex on robots many thanks for coming on the program big thanks to August should turn I could not garage on in Lagos Matthew Green here in London Thanks to you for listening and joined the rest of your weekend by by for now\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.
