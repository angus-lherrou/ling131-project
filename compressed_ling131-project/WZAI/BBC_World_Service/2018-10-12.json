ZIP Code in our region and\nMany parents I mean it's every uh strata of society I'm from the impoverished to the wealthy and there are many families that never expect something like I'm a heroin problem too too wrapped in in their family\nEven all these years as you say that it has been affecting communities a way you ripples [noise]\nYes I Would say there still are a lot of stereotypes about

that\nThat's actually one of the most gratifying things um because it's so Graham a subject and so difficult to cover um but when you can actually bring awareness and bring a bring change to something that needs change and needs awareness um it it's very gratifying I think for all of us\nOn this story as it is that one ... personal story that stands out to be\n[noise] I mean there's so many um it's

documentary everyday Americans stops on the BBC well so this this weekend [noise]\nTo Liberia now what questions are being asked about how an American run charity set up to provide an education for girls ended up being a place where a number of them was sexually abused instead\nThe more than me educational charity was founded by an American woman Kay she might she raised millions of dollars I was even given a building for free for her when I was ... by then Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nBy two thousand fourteen tree is offering launched a number of bills came food ... they had been raped by the organizations main coordinator Macintosh jumps and he\nWent to prison and they died of aids to the fact that the child he was able to operate ... funds despite the scandal and get as many people who might be one man who took up the story in a year long investigation is in young he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by public ... on time magazine\nSo this is an organization that was that was set up by American under a market that's basically the girl the actual exploitation but in the background or come to a park about in the garden was exploiting many of the girls that what we would look into it was like well what are the girls are widespread was when he died\nIn twenty succeed but what was stuck or something what would that look\nNow Macintosh you speak all these the the ... the ... the man who's\nWomen he was in Liberia and himself and he was one of the people instrumental in that and she needs finding don't fool the school wasn't tea which in itself was quite amazing\nYes so Microsoft junk than on you or to find these multiple girls the violent won't support or scholarships that late there in our school or he describes himself as a former child soldier well I think that in the in the context of West point with the highly vulnerable girls all of a sudden you have any power he had\nMultiplied as a consequence of the internationally funded scholarships that I'm public ... more than the academy which\nWhich was really something that but when the news over over Liberia\nHe managed to get to the east coast to the school and then it was found out that he had been abusing them in this in the southeast quite central to this whole story because how was it discovered the\nFirst girl came forward um in January of funky for the ... and that was for the schools are um the nurse was also aware that the closeness between a John spin on viola you're having fun with other relationship\nOr could have affected her she was perceived but she came she came forward with this news of the conflict there was a five month late and which according to police report we've all girls for it but then in ... there is there is in Iraq and more girls we can go forward\nAnd and then ten girls press charges but according to a charge you talk to them as many as ... the one in\n... but it happened under the auspices\nOf the charity which is supposed to be looking off do these go the charity we raised me in the money saying they saving these girls from sanction exploitation giving them an education\nMultiple girls folded ... yourself with the public school\nBoxing on the first day going forward but that's also reflection of the fact that in Liberia badly the resources are are often below\nThat if someone is able to access to resources like Milo was able to weather was quick to jump in the mission or left or like the more traditional bonus I think that when someone is able to accept the money to provide services there can be an active shooter well OK it might not be perfect but maybe it's the best we're going to get\nYou see the questions ... why would they still allowed to operate by the government when this whole scandal came to light today was found that dozens of gum um\nAt least ten of them than he could be more ... to ... some actually um what may pregnant by this man\nTo jump out of school why did they still allowed to operate\nI think it's challenging I think that because anytime there's ... there's always a community there's always an enabling element from the people who either you or should have gone but those who are benefiting and and then didn't take steps to safeguard those who are more vulnerable but one of the girl to report on our stories story\nWhen we spoke when he spoke to she had she probably should have been abandoned by the organization that was a girl that had a very hard life\nA lot of the girls who had gone through all of this must be brave enough to testify\nThat that she regretted testifying because she'd been told by the organization that she did everything would be fine by me and she felt she was little I think the key thing to remember an officer thought that was about ... about the violent and more than the resources west by\nThat weren't coming otherwise they wouldn't organization that was that the\nHelp of the food with a little bit of those who struggled so even those who perhaps felt that they were treated badly there there were like the uh there was a fear that well my story by telling my story I could lose what ... what led loving given by this organization that I was going to step up\nAnd that the me to find behind the film called on the tactic nice nights and it's not just at time magazine and ... and ... organization has actually issued a response happened\nYeah they say that they moved to me this to support children with safety has an education we horrified girls enjoyed this abuse at the academy um they say that they once they came to attention seeing yourself attention they report to do to swim fleet\nAnd that jumps and was arrested just four days also seen yourself was notified these criminal acts and they say we deeply sorry

is one of the reporters I lost to white Kentucky had such high levels of opioid abuse\nOne reason is that that many years ago back in the nineties actually uh at the eastern part of our state the

those prescription pills that pain pills we have a high level of of pain and our uh Appalachian region\nWhich has a many coal miners and other people who are involved in manual labor and and then uh end up with severe pain and and and a lot of people just became addicted to those medications\nAnd then once the addiction took hold there really wasn't enough treatment Centers for these are folks and then when um when the heroin came around they took that because they still had the addiction that hadn't\nBeen treated you'll do yeah and your paper Laura I'm run a story with the headline pet

many of the organization students\nAccording to their statements to police had been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten when the apes began and paint girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names or given to staff of the time as many as thirty\nAccording to an internal charts talking\nDo you know how many girls will actually raped as a number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh Johnson how do the investigation unfolds will basically this was an organization that has had some rumors around it and it was no one in Liberia that there'd been accusations of rape\nBut but really no one ever gone deep and to\nReally find out what exactly happened and why it happened and also one of the interesting things about it is that the organization right after this happened it was never a negative repercussions their scope of operation within the country has grown there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role\nIn the crimes that are the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in his care so when the ... came to light\nThe organization essentially said and this was in their press statement that this was a community issue according to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central ... who died an intimate relationship with the wind or they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they hadn't\nThe educate these these girls through their scholarships and also give them access to the school and then when it came to light he had been reaping these girls they essentially said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own\nOperating cultures and a challenge in context may have contributed to his ability to access than to abused young girl they ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be raped will actually infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so while the organization took steps to make sure that attend girls who had testified against him were tested and they didn't take steps to ensure that the white or student population also were tested so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named as victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so so very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization according to our investigation really failed to confront and a meaningful way\nAnd uh [noise] so what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continued to operate do you have there been any changes of told to make it hard to fool the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place it's definitely true that the organization sought\nTo to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually that was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped one of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time two\nGirls were the first time according to their statements that at least

the European Parliament\nFor the u._k. green policy thank you all for joining us before we begin I Want to introduce one more pests than a nuts you re ... he's one of the authors of this week's IPC see reports and he's with me here in the studio\nYou read the report cool for the well to aim to keep the rise in global temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to come at a price\nIs the well on track to me or anything like that target festival\nTo clarify the report doesn't call for anything the report on to the question that the government has asked the if you see\nIn two thousand Fifteen into Perry's agreement and it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warming to one point five and now this report\nClearly shows that there is an important difference between warming won't born five and two degree and also shows the means and the reason rich global warming can be limited to that level\nAnd so just to be clear is the well them try to do anything like that\nTheir report is also very clear to rule is smoke on track currently the pleasures of the countries that they have submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions over time into twenty thirty whereas a mission should be decreasing very very deeply by twenty\nSays if temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nThere is the prospect of short flights being possible using ... technology at some point same wave law a long distance trucking do\nDo you think that it's like they I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to\nTo have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels it's currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energy use and every kilowatt hour every message will is ... is going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys flying\nNot everybody but clearly people do I think\nI think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that they're actually putting things into you know five flying is one of the most environmentally damaging DVDs one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that people especially it so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable live how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions 'cause they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible uh Simon I'm American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in her life has deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker\nA more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly because you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are often outside the city center so I'm a and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flight\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have medical legalize they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design a will there's both lowering our missions and one in which people living standards Ohio\nLords he is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that since the end\nThink here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand five to ten but some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs\nQuite a long term costs the I'll give you some examples we know that the increase of seeing an extra seat to practice and that you can't another country and in other countries have hurt the most a low income people for a larger share of their\nIncome is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no do says what we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor the short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the fossil fuel industries\nYou know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've\nUh emergence of these other high technology sectors that were saying it may be the case I think the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we cannot mitigate we have to meet to get\nThese ... cases if I can just bring you back from a ... year he was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of question some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier round you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the terms mission was a massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can totally that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition to we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work from the sustainable finance area we can say the\n... financial products ... pension products have to be aligned with a one point five Paris target for example I can see that and I was in the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and they in much in the world that is climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult it will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes now\nKnow I just want to work to do that when asking the question who is going to pay for this\n... something to redo no because otherwise we could just go on the business as usual project wants to just reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and when asking the question was going to\nPay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already returned observing today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree of warming\nAnd with two degree of form induces ... in the far future this is um one point five to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who's going to pay for ducked\nDown the road and find them eat the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefree managed and they have to be carefully managing managed so ducked the issue the poor of the impacts of this show duck tape it can be compatible with sustainable development and entering a real welfare law where he wants to come back and\nAnd I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and that they were just made a lot has been done we have Ninety nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries we auctions fifty eight countries that are that have other places to see that when you both and\nThanks to all these work over the past ... years or so we've seen costs the cost of mitigation coming down significantly so he says making it easier reason to global carbon price for instance has agreed no but do is that what do we need and\nI mean it might be the most efficient ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next election but I think what do we have to realize there's being um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best\nPolicy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally being\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications unconscious indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's these investments ... it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have\nBeen doing it it's not enough as they say the report is reminding us okay um but I Do think this points out he's made all center report about making sure that the most vulnerable or not heard is not just necessary for\nEthical reasons but he's also necessary for political reasons because only in that situation do you get the support you need both you know so when we talk\nTrends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty cents even down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to\nDouble Ninety Chilean will be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we might the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years eve we grow at the ... rates of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next four years they are trends in the global economy that are going to happen\nWe have a choice of whether we continue with\nOur current growth model which was delivering US cities the dock ingested polluted unpleasant places debate not productive or we designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing\nTo make investments in a more sustainable economy rather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast and now ... got ...\nAnd you eat the gal

the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for a think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protests\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an him in a crisis because that's their charge from the United nations about his level but\nI mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this little seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are a pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron ... talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't is not lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and the abuses science to argue for the fact that use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think fat\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on the science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBubbled wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not decided that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how that how do you decide gate and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states and cities some companies all fact we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nPaul ... when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it seems to be cheaper to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut he's in the ... the facts are becoming separates it from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she said olds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is Easter appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including coal mining industry um we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is part of coming up the solution here\nBut the the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is pick up because it's sea level rise and there's a good chance that the warmer than average waters and the goals were partly puma because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress in the U.S has gone way this has been in the

pasta Andrew Brunson mocked low and joins us from Istanbul or he's been in jail for two years on charges of supporting terrorism or what might happen today\nThere is an expectation cautious optimism I think from the Americans stand that a pastor Brunson might be released\nYou see news or scoops that they had gotten a secret deal that had been struck between the American ... governments to release pasta Brunson by sentencing him to time already spent hair in\nDetention remember this is a case that has led us turkey relations to plummet I'm Donald Trump lost patience with the fact that he was still intention here I Would have some uh two years after he was and she looked up\nAt that led to sanctions on two Turkish ministers and um the White House announcing at trade tariffs\nOn steel not a million would be doubles encore reciprocated and so a U.S techie relations plummeted and with it\nThe Turkish lira that's lost forty percent of its value against the daughter of this year so if he is

update there's no counting the millions of lives saved by the discovery of antibiotics and you know the use of the twentieth century\nWill the twenty first to see the end of the effectiveness one of the reasons might be the widespread use of herbicides\nWhich is adding to the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria that's according to new research by scientists in New Zealand and I spoke to one of them he is professor jak hide them in from the University of cans of brand new Zealand to most of the connection between herbicide designed to kill weeds and antibiotic resistance\nNice surprise at all all of this is that as you say we expect herbicides to kill plants and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria but\nThe chemistry of these different kinds of of agents and drugs are such that bacteria proceed both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the ... the bacteria that we study but the bacteria I don't know this and they react to them as if they were good toxins\nBecause these are or toxins because herbicides or poor toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you'll get a sub lethal affect\nThe bacteria would respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for bombs that remove all those toxins from inside themselves to outside\nThat pre adapt the bacteria for exposures to toxins that are much more potent like antibiotics so the herbicides and a sense or vaccinating the bacteria against the antibiotics\nAnd this is happening this protest is on the way and the most harmless of sounding places anyway told the park's ... looms where people play with the dogs\nThat's right wherever herbicides and antibiotics may come together and they come together and these places because for example you might use herbicides on your lawn your cat uh or your neighbor's cat might walk through your lawn walk\nBack into someone's house where they're stroked that puts her side and application levels on their hands and they ...\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support WC a guy at Cape and islands dot org\nWe found that that particular combination when herbicides and antibiotics come together the development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicides\nWhat can be done professor\nWell first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of all the different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria these sub lethal effects on bacteria presently were unaware of any regulatory process in the world that asks these kinds of questions\nWhat would happen when these bacteria are exposed to sub lethal levels of chemicals that are people are routinely using either and work or at home\nThen once we have some sense of what kinds of combinations of chemicals could induce antibiotic resistance that could inform us into possibly revising what we think of as appropriate use of the different kinds of manufacturing chemical\nCan you imagine a post antibiotic era\nI can imagine it but it's not a very very pleasant image\nThe post antibiotic era will be like pre antibiotic era except we won't have the hope of new antibiotics so we have to be very very careful with the antibiotics we have now and the fuel yet to be discovered so that they continue to be useful to us in the future\nProfessor jak hind them in more than a million people were killed during eight years of fighting between Iran and Iraq a war that ended so to use
