complex and there are some gray areas but over what I'd say the Supreme Court's decision today was a victory for freedom of expression\nFreedom of expression includes both the right to express and a point of view but also the right to not be forced to express or facilitated view with which you disagree\nSo the up shot of today's ruling is the ashes cannot be legally forced to aid the promotion of same sex marriage by putting such a slogan on a cake\nBut it also means that gay bakers cannot be compelled by law to decorate cakes with slogans against gay marriage so it works both ways I certainly and it's got much wider implications and just gay rights does it say say president\nThat that that that people could discriminate on the grounds on the basis of religious belief that is what complicates it\nUm no I I think it's belief not religion it it's about an idea whatever the motive um the court is saying that a business doesn't have a right or doesn't have a duty to promotion idea whenever the idea is if it conflicts with its basic fundamental beliefs now\nThis issue is much wider than gay rights if ashes had been ruled against\nIf if if if the court said that they should be compelled to promote a message we disagreed you can imagine a scenario where a Muslim print or could be obliged by law to publish cartoons of Mohammed\nOr a Jewish print or could be forced to publish a book that propagate Holocaust denial or it could also encourage farmers extremist it among the other service providers promote that anti immigrant propaganda\nI understand that obviously in this

of step even with people or face a moreover\nWhat is very very difficult to me is um they asked the poor thing in effect discrimination in law they sign a law should discriminate against gay couples
