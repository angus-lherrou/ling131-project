did he think Italian government was hoping to do with this budget\nThese two parties where elected in the latest political elections back in March with some are on feasible promises and now they

dirty man into the is basically taxing and banks and insurance says\nAnd on the spending side a and a A N ... there is an increasing current expenditure mainly pension expenditures and also the so called basic income so\nAs you can imagine where they hide that to be um says I mean this is not the kind of a budget that easily needs\nAnd or it could actually undermine the long term sustainability and er it's no wonder that the rating agencies in financial markets or you know concerned about the the outfit\nAnd I think you'll understand that the government is going to make any effort to modify this budget I'm following the the demands solve the the European Commission\nOr not immediately I think it will take alive um I think uh uh the uh the governments\nWere applied to the to the commission that the intention to change it or the numbers and the targets for next year that the two point four percent of that for two for next year I'm either they will go ahead with the budget\nAnd eventually it will be protein and especially if the procedure which implies are preparing a plan correction plan for the following year so my guess is that two thousand Ninety and he's gone but then

to do something to worry about the whole the economy and spending more for instance some infrastructure has the potential did it not to boost the economy\n[laughter] yeah my point is that they really need to really an overall as you said about that on the supply side knocked on the demand eagerly does not need this report to the man\nI'm not a W needs some major reforms structural reforms to a

as being a candidate within that democracy and being a right wing candidate which clearly it's not an extreme right wing candidate and at the moment he is and also in accusations of illegal\nUp to spread fake news in the president election\nSo the problem here it's not just in relation to the Workers Party but also how the open notes from a shadow alchemy of the center ride from Medina seals on

S. I usually go Stuart security initiative on the other half towards various\nEconomic development and social development project so it is kind of counterintuitive to try to caught you know the funds that actually focused on what is the root causes of this\nSo you're saying that if those governments that receive age in the United states more reason for people to prosper and their own country\nThat is actually what has been happening the cooperation from the United states to this country's have more and more focus precisely in this type of initiative that tried to strengthen the countries\nAre it's not like now it's got to happen like and and some of his projects actually show advancement in this topics specifically so yes these are the things that we know that have worked\nAnd that it starts as I mean this is a long process but that are starting to work and caught in it ah does not help but\nSaid President Trump's supporters would say that that aid has been wasted because it hasn't gotten rid of the problem corruption still rice across ... countries\nThe power of the criminal gangs is gripping city centers and towns around the whole region and this age issue as both of them as pets the more you give them all the countries need where does it end\nFirst of all I I think the problem is that if you pretend to try to solve a problem\nThat is very long time you know very short term it's very complicated we're talking about countries that ... years ago were at war the democracies are starting even even\nWith it but there's a lot of people that actually could responsibility of the current situation on us and us intervention I Do end as wars and afterwards I Do believe that this project how old thought this is a slow process but this is the one process that works if you say well we're we're not close the borders are we going to stop age\nWhat is that going to do is that going to help you know what's going to help ... case the U.S\nHow able oh the ... in these various countries to stop this caravan of migrants posing through that countries\nThat problem is what's going to be the solution of what you can do about it if you're gonna you know accept than as refugees and try to establish camp center that it has to port in order to those is because without support it is very limited what this government can do and what shape that takes is definitely going to be very political and that is the other thing right the\nRhetoric and the elections being so close\nAlso make this a little bit more complicated this is not a problem of today this care of and it's not the first carbon but definitely put in pension and more pressure because of its disability\nWhat other options on ... to the United states to try to stop so many illegal migrants coming through\nI think a lot has to do with the conditions in the countries and promoting migration that is documented and that is legal the other thing is that we do see lower numbers of immigration there are more immigrants crossing and everything but it's in much lower numbers that it was\nFive years ago and it specifically for Mexico you see that a lot definitely what needs to be done his support this concrete and the other thing that needs to be done is promoting migration that it's orderly\nThat document that that is that it that is checked because the other part of the migration he's the man\nA real factor is that the U.S unemployment is under what it has been in decades and the reason I demand for this labor\nOpponents windy into American ... in Washington DC and we'll be heading line to the U.S in a few minutes sent to our and James ...\nDistribution of us has supported barn home advisor measuring homeowners were home improvement profession for Roger Mudd peers to remodel homeowners can reviews and book appointments home on or dot com and [noise]\nYeah you just got to tighten your belt and just hang on for the pretty much what it is it going on for the right people\nThe things we asked for to level the playing field was Wisconsin dairy farmers work looting in there that was good it was at a time when our dairy farmers ... ... ...\n...

legislature is controlled by the Republican Party for Nineteen twenties so we are really at the high water mark in an awful lot of ways so of course when you have a president who is controversial\nWho is opinionated and people are fascinated about him is going to probably result in some give back all our high water mark it's really because of the person in many ways that people identify with the
