real life\nAnd he turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of this man's spreading video\nThis really really fits it'd almost perfect example of the pattern that you see\nThese Russian trolls or the Russians on social media to take over and over and over again they're going to either create or take a piece of\nControversial material they're going to release it onto their state funded media social media platforms\nAnd then they're going to start talking about that piece of information\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context in politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election [noise] what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked\n[noise]\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles wanted\nThat's Dr molten Bayh he's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the

star wars film had so many women in ethnically diverse factors thing prominent roles and fish is gone some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten got curious so he decided to look into the profiling\nDirector Bryan Johnson\nSome of them except that behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\nAt the states you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying free weeks before an election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kinda have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's something else that doesn't really matter\nLet's stick to digest that it's not that divisions haven't always the existed in society ... example whatever people's thoughts would about the constant choices there would always be some people who would agree and some who disagree\nBut if ... our rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives infiltrating these spaces and sending up the volume as each one of those disagreements and of course a fractured society is a society that struggles to take action\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nFrom a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already look with skepticism at a western feminism\nThan what has video does is to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media and the context of conversations about the me too movement and so won\nThe ... is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments to vie do gets picked up by media around the world and uh because if you were so provocative\nOr it's the only down to increase the divisions in societies that all well already divided\nIf you are sympathetic to honest points or in other words if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that a rabbit\nOh on the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias then divvied year will only concerned is in the strongest possible terms you're very likely to see it as an example of the senseless political correctness brigade in action [noise]\nSo back to the question that we raised at the beginning of the program can we

whole new industry I'm from the other countries to follow Canada's example ... also concerns about the implications health and public safety aisle correspondents Jessica Murphy went to see one of the first kind of bishops opened its doors in British Columbia\nAn unassuming for from the outside very simple design and what I saw of course when I got there in the morning before it opened was people starting to line up and we saw that across Canada people lining up outside of these new legal stores are waiting for it open to be among the first customers of legal cannabis in the country [noise]\nSome of them said you know they'd been waiting for this for forty years for fifty years and you know other said they never thought they'd see something like this in a lifetime so when the store opened a cat in the morning first customers walk in you know ...\nRocket and throughout the gay and people were coming out they were showing off what they thought they were really just excited to be part of that day that legalization in Canada\nCanada who is is only the second country over to Europe wide to to legalize cannabis\nWhy legalize why this decision well there we didn't even by the Trudeau government is that\nProhibition has been a failure in their view that Canadians we're still heavy users of the drug especially Canadian use minors teenagers and so on so they said look we're going to try and bring in this new strict control regulation framework instead and in doing so they hope to reduce what they see as a failed to the west\nThe hands of miners profits out of the hands of criminals and and would reduce it some of the health and social harms that they've seen with the drug use and you talk about strict controls that are regulations will still be in place then\nWell just briefly what it looks like what is legal federally 'cause it's a bit of a patchwork across the country depending on the province the federally an adult so that's about Eighteen or Nineteen years old depending on where you are will be able to\nPurchase from a licensed producer\nAnd possess thirty grams\nOf the drug and dried form or its equivalent in Cedar oil form and you'll be able to use it again it's a bit of a patchwork same some places you'll just be able to use it in a private residence and others like Ontario for example ... most populous province you can use it essentially the same way you would if you were smoking cigarettes huge youth tobacco so that's roughly what it looks like now\nIt is regulated so a you have to buy it from a license producer it's still illegal to buy it on the black market to possess over thirty grams there actually some new infractions around selling minors which carry a charge of up to fourteen years in\nPrison so of course the Canadian Medical Association journal called it a national uncontrolled experiment not everybody is thrilled with this development older\nNot everybody is thrilled a lot of especially health organizations health groups\nPutting out press releases urging a lot of caution so there was that organization that you noted an organization representing psychiatrists warning about use of the drug\nFor people under twenty five so their concerns around developing brains issues around mental health a society representing gynecologist an obstetrician saying there was a growing body of evidence that there was risk of using the drug among pregnant women concerned about the development of the fetus so again\nBoth organizations were saying be cautious make smart decisions now we're hearing a lot about a green rush about the possible\nBoon to the economy that this development could have\nWhat are people thinking about that\nIn the month of legalization here in Canada I mean one of the headlines that you saw almost every day it was just talking with the stock\nPrices of some of these big license producers just rising and rising and rising a lot of speculation a lot of people really interested in joining this legal market to give you an idea Kennedy statistics agency it's national agency crunched the numbers they tried to figure out\nHow many people used it what kind of market there was an aide twenty Seventeen and they found that Canadians used or spent rather\nAbout five point seven billion dollars on campus\nMost of that was in the black market so that just gives you a rough idea\nDoing this and it's a it's amongst the first to do it all the countries will be watching very closely they absolutely ... and across the world has just been a bit of a shift around the attitude towards marijuana we're seeing obviously\nCanada is taking a very big step of the kind of a bold step I Would say and it is an experiment into this full legalization model but a lot of in the U.S of course a lot of states were ahead of us in terms of legalizing the drag on the state level it remains illegal federally in the United states\nAnd we're seeing other countries bringing on line medical marijuana frameworks we're seeing other countries are looking at decriminalization so having this experiment in Quetta seeing whether or not the Trudeau government\nIs able to realize the goals they put forward and if that is a successful thing I think there may be you know obviously other countries looking at that and seeing how that plays out\nThat was Jessica Buffy in Canada and

depends entirely on text messages which is a form of used to see you can share advice and he's just signed up its millions member I spoke to ... founder and chief executive Kenny you and and I asked him what kind of people used it\nI guess their primary level we're targeting people who don't have those other ways of communicating with each other as the roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia who have no connection to the Internet and therefore a massive information gap of finding\nA information and knowledge and how to improve the farmer or a bottle of disease now so we farm or we enable those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture in just about any local language for free or get spoke content back or even off line so using a an SMS message\nSo that technology is very simple technology it's SMS does does that well\nSo it's it's simple in the front and a son that's a message obviously a hundred and sixty ... it's a very simple information format but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get get content people in such a simple format\nAs open a former asked this question uh for example on on as a mess we don't use machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is their intent of the question where are they what are the farming and essentially use that analysis to match them to you know three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question\nAgain not content back to the original farmer\nNow you you go to a million members I think you just signed up a million the million man the war war\nIt wants to people [noise] yeah so ... million which is as I was so great milestone for us having to one point two million I'm I mean I think the the first thing they get a indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it\nOr even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched\nUm so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know it in context is is probably knew your seven or eight percent on Twitter\nUm you know we know protest more than a million questions and answers every single month a which gives you an indication of the level of content that we found is necessarily a fun system to use is not a social system its value for their businesses and people don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so I think that's probably the primary indicator that would say\nUh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand why they're using it and what sort of benefits they're seeing from it\nAnd we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally had information it's helping save their their livelihoods and farms through we farm it was an example of how it's been years or so I mean the example I I Would give is that there's a chicken farmer that was using we farm and in Kenya called called castle\nHe kept something in the region of of fifty chickens hum as and this was his entire livelihoods paid for his kids to go to school at dinner and he finally table or on a diseases ... killed so you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days\nOr any ask questions about this on we farming got get information back ah which vaccines to you is how do I just thought the disease spreading and he managed to save the rest of east chickens um which is I mean that's that is the minds entire livelihood and that's that's the kind of vital\nYou know often seems to us fairly basic information but it incredibly fundamental through these farmers but that we found is able to to to provide\nA Kenny you in from ... from a Mona El sol are from the ...
