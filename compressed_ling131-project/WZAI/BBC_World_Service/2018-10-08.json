back to the Paris summit at two thousand Chastain Lawrence went up until that point to Celsius hacked into sort of agree political soggy\nBut emerging from that conference was an agreement that

temperatures strings cold temperatures spells though does those are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought I'm assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes\nThat right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nWouldn't have been that we have to be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which wrote so much damage in the ... is just a few weeks back [noise]\n[noise]\nWell\n\n\nLast week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his mobiles were suggesting we hadn't fist\nShe wouldn't be a ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these storms tend to strengthen those temperatures were not unusually warm and\nWe were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an oceanic heat wave this extreme warming several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you\nReally warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before foreign ... made landfall ... raised with scale full wins the Atlantic side clinics but can read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in the forecast simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description outside from friday also which used as a great marketing heard of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strength of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics or intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously won't Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in in that tradition you could ...\nGlobal warming so we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists\nAnd that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and feather warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initialized ... so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that there had on the atmosphere temperature as well as atmosphere temperature changes that have\nOn once during the atmosphere to me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... vets are associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform changing of the F F T we actually have a pattern change of the F F T that comes from the fact that the climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by\nA uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in the set up\nThese conscience of geographical variation ... look on does a bonus of climate change so to speak because the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes\nThey sent me interest Michael Mann particularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see a wall still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming that region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support double UCI at Cape and islands dot org thing

seeing\nOne of the things you talked about his marriage jobs and you know and it's been the arguments of the current president and his administration that actually jobs or on the line because of some of the decisions that were taken to get rid of coal and gas how do you argue against that\nWell you probably look at facts which this administration sometimes doesn't look that closely had you know the facts that clean energy is winning in the marketplace that's where the job growth is it is not in the old fossil fuel sectors\nWe see clean energy taking off in the United states and it continues to move at a pace that's faster than we ever intended\nThat doesn't mean we're nearing any finish line but this administration doesn't understand about the jobs of the future versus trying to make

how when you don't burn coal you don't spill mercury into our atmosphere that's an or a toxin ... kids\nLet's talk about the contagious diseases that are moving in a changing climate to places where we've never had them before the drought we're facing let's talk about the opportunities we have to lift everybody up\nAnd moved to a future that's better for everyone I feel like we're fighting about nothing instead of grabbing the future in running\nTowards and this report would it make any difference to the conversation in the United states has been going to just be seen as another more of the
