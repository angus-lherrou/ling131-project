I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that have left to do with the identity of a sudden than with questions of justice\nWe can talk about that that little bit more Adrian past what does it mean to you\nThat politics is really about individualized or then street individuals are small groups very often focal minorities that saw rocky all getting for quality of inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevated of a commonality that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same can use these ... countries so there's a problem I think enough it's response individual lives and but I think it's an individual's response rather than more communal collective Islam\nYeah sure among you know to me into politics as crops two very different phenomena that are going on at the same time it's a lot of confusion stems from mixing goes up so I'm Wondering what we're seeing at the moment is a lot of a minority groups claiming equality claiming riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing\nThink we are seeing as sort of movements but as Adrian just said I sort of trying to re center the basis of liberal democracy from being about individuals to being ... about groups has ... elements of the state line of try to [noise]\nBeing coded as oppression and that's a real difference between actually being oppressed and\nRachel is that rather an important point Adrian ... says it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nBut I think the problem is that you have on the one hand very technocratic leads believing abstract things that doesn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people on the one hand and then you have lots of minority or majority responses to that and I think none of it is very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you up like a wise or whether you're a venue ethnicity or any ... any sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims days we'll oppression exploitation\nBut the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ...\nThat that doesn't ask to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about ... writes could you have complained that you'll suffering you'll repression was an offense against humanity many people would have some you know recognize it but that's exactly in fact what\nThe tea movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately want in ... exactly the same as what ... and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit with them will just society would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big sick\nAnd very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin American stand up comedian who falls enough with ... can go then to sort of dramatic life story they have no spot is\nUm [noise] I was amazed by the way in which that movie which tells in the mainstream romantic comedy a story of an interracial marriage\nStarted to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't that problematic that this round protecting us have to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the right was saying\nWho has if you find somebody who he was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and it was parts of the left but some of food that was problematic size leaving me is the crux of a disagreement about what society one because I went to society whether it's more into racial match where there's more contact between\nHe has to stay in the lane and devoid cultural ... and you put a picture and in a movie of interracial relationships is probably my identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the Ron Paul has come up\nI find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like a kind of cheesy\nA wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left on my life\nWho even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we'd have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheet about all falling in love and living happily ever after moving we coached on politics until it kind of button all Hollywood wrong call\nModel I Would for you in 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on that issue though GB T rights and the way that change but feel free to come into ... well I think\nThe what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful is on a on an artery social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party and there's somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're\nBlack or they're Pakistani but you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong\nBecause you might use the wrong word you might express something that's a little you know not all perfect there's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful\nIt's intolerance outline will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on all ...\nKeep on saying we'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow the differences defined as more than the ... of course they're real differences out than to celebrate it\nBut they also the coming out she's that's how we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus then they shouldn't be warm\nBut the memory simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's I think that politics has become\nSo do you live on strike I I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I for the handwringing about authoritarianism land\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example the only example that would get and it was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo so let me give you a couple of examples of first what I Want to make the uh but I think a lot last night in many ways is an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to our understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think that as one of them and put back I've met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers it was also true that the majority of the people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the registry small portion of the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to the education is if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is a particularly deepen justice but you know what if you're a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually there's two\nWhite people who got shot by the police as well one last quick question to you before we wrap up this tough ... people have never lived in ... show Monday religious monolingual states this is new to the new\nSituation that we find ourselves and why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nReasons why I think it's difficult and I guess is because a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society simply no longer function fiscal policies trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and can\nThat's why people feel this is a sense of powerlessness is a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized nothing the problem with essentially than she is by definition exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier ...\nWell it's hard to disagree with the premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a mono ethnic ... self conception of themselves and find God who started to challenge that we now live in societies which most people embrace the idea that the more to ethnic societies that if something has talked quite new Korea\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which that addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that\nWay by is minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called identity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering\nOkay pledged to think about that thank you for ... panel grandfather Gopal\nYes among ... and Adrian ... we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think of the program or any ideas the topics you'd like us to look into you can email us that the real story at BBC don't care what you K O tweet me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have a pulled cost you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll cost [noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

I Do feel happy and his biggest space people pushing themselves into these\nWell I think that because the mainstream parties offering something that's inclusive been off they still stand for you know a consensus that has failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree with that of course the working class is not simply watching a lot of other components of the of the working class has suffered in often suffered more than the white working class but saying the other people have suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide\nAlso you know we're rebelled against the status quo and and who reached to tell them to somehow that I didn't see much less the mess of all there's not a small thing I'm not saying you did what I'm saying\nThe idea that somehow we can just say\nWe don't even look at the most depressed people in the early ... an India and everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not the president and build some of rational utility maximizing preaches we ...\nWe have people who embedded in relationships institutions not since feelings do method is angel longing and if I'm going to place to people to communities and countries masses we can all today that feeling out of politics or will it got to\nThe obvious question that footage and that has been loaning ... onto wet and ease positive reasons identity politics that actually it is people expressing a sense and on the ... that actually that that identity that was that the fool whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there that these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or your Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact\nThat's a boring observation in northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tried then they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interest not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... hit the easy\nIt's a cool policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on the door a bull in some ways it was if you'll\n... and ... and you a pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India Hindu view of India it winds bodes\nWell one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as as a species break up into what are often very competitive\nClumps sorry I'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice but to the tribal it is a problem but I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's\nA natural tendency of people to especially when the larger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's\nAll the politics happens because those tribes are bad but other tribes are okay\nI mean I'm very bad I don't know I mean I think the\nQuestion is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who as close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious ethnic food and the question is how do we deal with this in highly diverse society in a productive manner\nA one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen I look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years and I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response\nIs to try and domestic hated ... feast of national is to try and claims pause files to make that inclusive to say that he's a high or a collective\nUh it is a level of magic kingdom of looking at states but obviously we fight for inclusion of all different groups under that common identity how do you make that choice\nW sea

doc a side of history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots you love that country it's a question of mutual respect\nEach other all the anxiety saying that you love found that it really isn't that are going to tour what's wrong and loving your country and its people\nAccuse people of identity politics but I'm saying that your national dizzy and Livio poster nationalism I imagine you are and your your your um your your\nNational thing making my country but for the action of much of a\nTown and I said look of Hindu majority of them so I look at nationalism that's something that had served to step in the anti colonial struggle with today has become a very deeply dangerous obese\nWhat is the writer response will be ... for it is the or the national Congress party but sad but we're all Indians are respective a\nNominee that he's not true I mean it's not our facility older a form of national lives in the Congress talk he didn't have ... elements to it the one\nOn the days of areas of angry as well as the agent if if I can bring you back then in a sense there there is a we\nWe do seem to be making a distinction between figure identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such gets\nWell because I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more of rocks and that can build a bridge you know we can be work because we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be London as we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause I'm bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further the kind of cosmopolitan and they all spoke about\nThat can doesn't have to uh can be a bit abstract I think the ... isn't that option I think a lot of people feel European\nBritish or German or French but I also feel they have a low cost them to see these layers of possible\nSo that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we managed to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here and beyond says that if everybody identifies primarily with the national ...\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu and Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough and\nTo gather productively and peacefully whereas if we've had our sense of collective pride at the level which coincides with the actual how is\nIt a sense it doesn't everybody carry multiply and of course unless you're offsetting should in between the identity is what she choose for yourself on the ones that have foisted
