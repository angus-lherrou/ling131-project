protection and machine audio protection because humans of course how some limits to their perceptual ability for example after it very loud\nProceeds very quiet town for free speech recognition system that's just the fame and there's other effects like that so not only can you not hear quiet sounds after an hour\nBut also when you have a very loud sound at one frequency for example let's say you at the very very our age\nFifty herds ... then you won't be able to hear very quiet following like at fifty five for its really close by to that level sound and all of those so called cycle acoustic masking effect are utilized already by many gadgets and check so for example you were MP three player\nAlso uses those cycle a coup stick effect\nTo be able to work with very compressed audio files in MP three including you only in cold that information that is relative and that is protected the choice human listener and you can\nThrow away you can discard parts of the silent that won't be perceived or maybe not include them so precise me so there's a lot of tech out there that's using those um cycle Christie masking effect but we were wondering if it would also be possible to use them to hide\nInformation from humans which would then be very clearly proceed with the for an automatic system\nRight so it seems from your research that there are ways of am betting on through imperceptibly bold move by militias ... within very sounds and they might be able to trigger something like\nOne of your voice systems or elect so you have another example which involves an autonomous cars do you like joy ... what is that well\nThe idea is really that if we have\nThat were controlled by voice and we can use that very same attack factor to make it for example in in our example activate the emergency brakes by voice\nSo there you all you'll being driven by you know it's one of them is called Simon and Garfunkel on the radio and as I\nAm I on me\nI mean that music sounded

the ... and found the\nObviously this is proof of principle and bumping that you'd be points on and you'll probably be you haven't actually done this or you were the ... as it were just going straight to the voice recognition system so that made me very much a proof of principle\nThat's the lines in the nation that are currently have\nAnd the second imitation is that we're currently assuming that we know all the parameters of the speech recognition system so in effect were attacking\nThe speech recognition that we've trained ourselves that's a ... system so it's a speech recognizer that is very widely used and the research community and we're pretty sure that that's also used in many commercial systems\nThat we definitely need to know all its parameters and to compete fracture in order

your main message that you want to get across from this research\nWhat I really think that frankly it's the point in time we're companies offering speech recognition systems should look at how to make

does move the field on the term\nWearables if you just think about it was really developed to describe something we don't wear what we where we call close\nAnd that really sets the stage for really what we've been focused on here which is really getting technology into the things you actually we're into your clothes into the fabric and into the fiber themselves\nAnd that really is what sets us apart and and what makes this point in history so special\nSay are we moving beyond that will find strands of cup of waving in food like a black T shirt that you just buy from the local store and then

in and out but the most important material the most in in corn class of materials that really enables all of the technology that we know of today is called the Seventy\nAnd until very recently literally a few weeks ago\nThere were no real reports on how to get semi conductors into fibers and into fabrics and without semi conductors your phone is not smart at all without semi conductors we don't have computers and without semi conductors we don't have displays and we don't have communication [noise]\nAnd so um what I wanted\nForeign ... getting semi conductors into fibers and fabric as an enabler of functionality and enabler of you know I don't like to use the term smart or we could leave that to describe humans but certainly something which is highly functional and technological and it's actually\nDo digital revolution happened after all because we have good uh I'm growing components transistors and I said wait for the for the good comic go so far as to say well now you all

the comparisons that are generally made are made between our current climate where we are now in a climate before humans began to exert an effect on the climate system [noise]\nSo what we tend to do is we run parallel experiments we run experiments where we're stimulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in stimulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like prior to humans producing in effect\nAnd we compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happened more frequently or more intense or none of the above in the current climate relative to that parallel simulation of the past climate\nThe American beach where old school for ... approaches methodical and cautious with analyses being invited from ... off to the uh\nReview and number crunching to follow through the

right there is a pretty unequivocal at this point we have pretty high confidence and those types of events and likewise cold temperatures the reduction in cold temperatures strings cold temperatures spells though does those are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought I'm assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes\nThat right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nWouldn't have been that will that please be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which rules so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back\nWell\n\n\nIn last week's program climate soldiers Michael Mann explains the several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his mobiles was suggesting we were heading for something\nOf a comma let me issue and be a culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predict\nAtlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these storms tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an oceanic heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before farms made landfall ... rage with scale full wins the Atlantic sunk clinics but can read Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in the forecast simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was the most pacification overland after impact of the storm with fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great ... of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strengths of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing a slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the ... Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you could ... them specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to\nSurface temperature and that's been something that that an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern is in uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer area and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initialized ... so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change for a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as atmosphere temperature changes that have\nA washer and the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... vets are associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform\nChanging of the F F T we actually have a pattern change of the F F T that comes from the fact that the kind of system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and for that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in this set up\nThese patents have geographical variation ... look under the bonus of climate change so to speak because the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see a wall still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually expanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier\nWe're seeing storms turned into\nThe rover in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nUse marginal changes to the Atlantic but potentially ... then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many of the events that have mocked the past few months\nSea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most some is recovering more poorly each Windsor\nJulian stream of the national ... center was recently in the Arctic between Alaska and Siberia seeing kind of self continuing decline in Arctic ice\nOne of the things when I was just out in the Arctic Ocean and the ... see we really struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up an ice camp and also thick enough to support many people out there doing their their field observations\nAnd also we were trying to deploy ... and you know we couldn't find many flows that were very thick so we're putting out these buoys and ice that may be a meter sick and you're hoping that it was still survive", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Brewster", "day": "07"}
