I'm drew would our business present this morning I just coming up to twenty minutes possibly out could scientists\nHave found a cure for a drug resistant strain of tuberculosis new combination of drugs have successfully treated more than Ninety percent of patients who have this form of TB and batteries which is good news considering about guys this is the world's deadliest infectious disease last year\nIt killed at least one of ... million people around the world doesn't pulled up would you Ari it's from the international union against tuberculosis and lung disease\nStudying Bella rooster significant because\nIt's a country with an extremely high burden of the most difficult forms of tuberculosis what we call extensively drug resistant tuberculosis or ex T. R. T. V. and that in addition to what we call\nMulti drug resistant tuberculosis it's one of the top five countries in the world and so they had a difficult time in treating patients\nUsing the ... they were able to find that these very very difficult patience that they were able to actually have an extremely good success rate of Ninety three percent is one of the two new drugs that we have for tuberculosis in the last fifty years\nSo uh this is a ... is a big breakthrough but it points out the need for more\nKinds of drugs like this and it's important because with tuberculosis you cannot treat with just one drug\nYou must have at least to effective drugs so just in developing one and and just giving that alone is going to cause resistance to that particular drug\nSo it was the ... the only way to beat tuberculosis is to have one drug and combined with the others was does that mean it was simply a case of mixing a coke south together in the right\nAnd then eventually the bingo you've done it right now since the ...\nIt means that you do have to combine them with the drugs that we already know about and uh but that's not going to be good enough pretty soon you're going to need additional new medications in order to get to the to the bottom of treating tuberculosis in all its forms\nWhy is the book you know it's just so from aids points of view so successful tuberculosis is successful it's it's an organism that can live\nIn your body in a dorm at fashion you can live there for years maybe never even developed if your immune system is healthy you may never even actually develop the actual disease all just like dormant in your body and some ... and then other times if your immune system is weak for example when you have HIV when you have diabetes\nOr in other conditions that where your immune system goes down certain cancers like kidney disease that can actually make the organism come alive again to actually develop to actually develop the deed disease of tuberculosis\nAnd tuberculosis is spreading to the rich countries is that correct\nI think that the tuberculosis is a disease of low and middle income countries in countries like the United states the the the numbers and the rates are very low but there is something very interesting that's going on in especially the middle income countries like South Africa\nChina India needed the countries that have some of the highest burdens of tuberculosis there now middle income countries they're rich countries are becoming richer and with that becomes better nutrition and in some cases a lot of obesity why is that important because obesity is linked to diabetes and diabetes is linked to the curriculum is is because\nIf you have diabetes your risk of coming down with tuberculosis is three times higher so that we can have the thinking but it's like putting fire\nOn something where you're tuberculosis is common and now you're going to have diabetes adding fuel to that fire and I can see a a growth of the tuberculosis in somebody's especially middle income countries that quarter of the world faces and it is in India\nOkay and then if they're if the obesity is going up there then you have the ... the people who have a dormant in their bodies growing in a place like the United states where the where the of background\nA level of tuberculosis very low even when you have obesity you're not in diabetes in term it's not you're not going to see the effects as much\nFor the service for countries like India South Africa China the prior so you will be to fights obesity would die a weed lifestyle and through that way you can be tuberculosis\nAnd that's one of the ways that you were able to beat\nFor tuberculosis it to make sure that people are treated appropriately with the right combination of drugs\nTo pull the food you are there for me the rational union against tuberculosis and lung disease telling us about discovery by scientists but to Ninety percent of

has revealed the menu for confidence protected areas such as national parks of loss underfunded\nJenny middle of the University of California is a coal so it's a study\nAbout Ninety percent of protected areas with lions are underfunded it's a pretty dire situation\nWe found that these parks require between one to two billion dollars annually in order to adequately protect lands but they

saving people it's an investment in people as well\nBut more ... repeated this on the funding of parks is a long term problem and yet the lions are still look\nThat's a good point um lions are very resilient species generally but we're now at a tipping point for their species so unless we act now there are species will continue to\nWe feel like the timing of this study is particularly useful
