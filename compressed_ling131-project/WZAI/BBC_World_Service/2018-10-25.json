[noise]\nPicture this you sitting on the train maybe scrolling down your Facebook feed your totally minding your own business\nAnd suddenly someone poses a bottle of water down your lap\nIn shock you try to piece together what's happening and you see a woman\nBrown hair black skirt black leather jackets\nJust like that\nShe's calling you see her rushing out of the carriage but when you look down at your genes you find a large white staying where you've got splashed not only with water but also bleach\nIf this sounds familiar to you that's because you may have come across the V. do that when bottle on social media capturing exactly vaccine\nIt was filmed in the St Petersburg metro by a Russian activists called an adult because\nShe wanted to send a message to those men spread is out there sit with your legs wide open in public show the world how much of a macho man you are and will teach you less [noise]\n\nIn the days that followed the release of divvied you a moldy studying picture stopped managing\nSuch there were reports at least one of the men splashed we'd watch was paid to appear to feed you and then suggestions the whole thing was the propaganda be staged an orchestrated by the crumbling\nIt'd be almost perfect example of the pattern that you see these Russian trolls take over and over and over again\nSo what is the truth is is this video part of a broader disinformation campaign orchestrated by the Russian government or is it just distance pulled by a Russian activist with a genuine concern\nMm\nI'm like ... and with me as a reporter who's been looking into this story Marco sells them\nUp and trying to uncover the truth behind these bottles video protest against men spreading we'll hear from the Russian activist in the eye of the storm but we'll also talk style\nThe meet a Russian troll hunter [noise]\nThis sounds like the kind of forensic work that you'd expect security or intelligence agencies to be doing a Josh has a background in programming and I see\nAnd he knows the mind of a troll because well he used to be a troll he got a kick out of pushing people's buttons on line\nJumping into hashtags on Twitter and are sending out tweets that trick people into thinking on someone else so when there was a a thanks Michelle Obama supposedly high schoolers were sending out this week with pictures of their\nDisgusting looking hunch is I just randomly looked up are fun to play and tweeted out with the hashtag thanks Michelle Obama and it\nIt went viral it ended up in a lot of the conservative online newspaper she was kind of funny because all of my previous two weeks before that are where the tweets of obviously not a high schooler\nRoom uh\nHaving followed dozens of Russian troll accounts having studied that'd be have yet Josh isn't a great position to tell us wanting submission wolf that looks like in real life\nAnd he turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of these men spreading video\nThis really really fits is almost perfect example of the pattern that you see\nThese Russian trolls or the Russians on social media to take over and over and over again they're going to either create or take a piece of\nControversial material they're going to release it onto their state funded media social media platforms and then they're going to start talking about that piece of information and you'll see them\nJump onto like Youtube video and they will run commentary talking about in this case it would be anti social justice warriors and then they would also come in with the pros social justice warrior accounts\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nRight let me put it in these times meant spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it and as we do provoked very strong feminist and anti feminist responses\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on social media accounts and you'll find that rather aggressive comments\nIs that ... right but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context in politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election [noise] what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the well the politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked\n[noise]\nThat would come by itself as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged with the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat's Dr molten Bayh he's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the University of Southern California but more importantly he's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the union yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of an evil and good imbalance\nWhen Star Wars the last jet I came out last year some sounds took issue with the casting choices you seat never before I had to stall will steal match so many women in ethnically diverse ... prominent roles and fish is gone some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at directing Ryan jumps and\nSome of them except for the behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\nThere were sixteen out of nine hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been\nAround for at least you know a number of years and the Russian trolls have been served themselves in American discourse on line for a number of years and all kinds of situations\nThat you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before an election and so if you watched\nAre they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's\nSomething else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer attack say that's the kind of idea just a generally destabilize the harmony that normally exists between people so that the nation is just not coming together at all\nLet's stick to digest that it's not that divisions haven't always existed in society it's like the star wars example whatever people's thoughts would about the costume choices that would always be some people who would agree and some who disagree\nBut if ... our rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives thought infiltrating these spaces and sending up the volume as each one of those disagreements and of course a fractured society is a society that struggles to take action\nAs Yoda says anger leads to hate may lead to the dark side and I think that there's a lot of anger out there right now this is a tactic as old as war fanning the flames of anger and the populace as a very very easy way to start\nUprisings but Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nFrom a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism\nThen what happens to be due does is to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media and the context of conversations about the me too movement and so on\nThe continent is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments divvy do gets picked up by media around the world and uh because of the ways so provocative\nOr it solely bound to increase the divisions in societies that all well already divided\nIf you are sympathetic to honest points or in other words if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that a rabid conservative writers just spinning out of control\nOn the other hand if you already have an anti feminist biased then divvied you will only concerned is in the strongest possible terms you'll very likely to see it as an example of the senseless political correctness brigade\nSo back to the question that we raised at the beginning of the program can we conclusively say that and as video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ease campaign against this information suggesting if you're looking\nFor a smoking gun here then we don't have one but what we can say is that whatever the truth is this whole ... suddenly fits into a broader than one very similar to people studying the way Russia drives it's disinformation\nCampaigns but at the end of the day does that really matter does it matter to know whether or not and as video which raises a valid point I suppose is an act of propaganda\nWell I'm going to let Josh the rushing troll hunter we spoke to earlier on um sometimes\nMy real even goal here is to get people to be a little more conscious about\nWhat they decide to share on line and get people to maybe understand the sharing this piece of what looks to be on verified information or this viral retreating is very by rote tweet that confirms your political bias\nMy not always be the greatest thing to just take like a couple of minutes and look at what you're getting ready to do before you do it\nSo as we've said before think twice before you ...
