with them\nI'm curious what missile I spoke to independent research just Stephanie hat and I asked to what exactly needs reforming about the WTO\nIs three main points so at first as they want\nSo the monitoring system so you've got a hundred and sixty four countries around the world all trading together it's really difficult to keep an eye on what's happening now right everything's technical now and that brings us into the second point which is they need to modernize trade rules for the twenty first century so we're talking everything from digital trade\nTo international investment to state owned enterprises that's code for China by the way\nUm and the third thing is that they want to safeguard and strengthen the dispute settlements system to right now it's really tedious\nLengthy and inefficient to try to resolve disputes between countries\nWhich is why we're in the current situation we're in which is that the United states and China are breaking the world Trade Organization rules and having their own private trade war at the moment that started this summer and it's not great because it floats the WTO rules in which case why should the other one hundred sixty two members of all of them\nOver all these people that are meeting in Canada obviously with trying to in the United states not being invited to the world's two largest economies so how's it going to look\nIt sounds like a disaster and not have them there but at the same time it might be really inefficient to have them there at this early stage so one of the things we could see as a negotiating strategy is that\nThese Thirteen stakeholders are joining Canada for this today Jan Murray of ideas come up with some solutions and then present them to the to feuding parties as look\nThis is a nice basis for discussion what do you think what do you like and it really takes something on the disposition and personality and ... and insurance of the people who are committed to multilateral trade to keep doing that I mean that this is diplomacy this is state craft\nThis is stuff that Canada frankly is very good at\nRight on the European Union is very good at it the United states used to be very good at it but under US President Donald Trump we've seen him on to renegotiate the north American free trade agreement which he has recently done and he took that right to the wire he's pulled out of the Paris or he didn't want to sign up the United states the Paris climate accord he doesn't like\nInternational agreements and he was complaining that the United states spends too much on NATO for instance which isn't true by the way but he likes to say that and to paint the United states as a victim\nChina similarly also is saying you know we're really happy to be part of the world Trade Organization but we are really against we oppose anything that's got penalize our state owned enterprises because that's a huge part of how they operate\nOf the main functions of the WTO that have a lot of ... looking at international trade the U.S has actually been withholding appointments too\nDoes that say you got the United states and the one hand saying that you know\nWe're going to withdraw if the WTO doesn't shape up and then on the other hand making it really difficult for the world Trade Organization to function by blocking the appointment of judges who who do all of the education so that sounds inconsistent they would say that this is part of the way of forcing the issue\nForcing the negotiation and we saw the former head of the world Trade Organization amending ... let me say say what you like about Donald Trump by him wanting the trade war with China and threatening to withdraw the United states he has done what many people have said needs to be done which is to reform\nThe WTO that

those questions so the first in your ear off to rate your mood now how how tense your feet and yes so you have great care so like how\nDiscussing you for the right now how anxious you're once you're done with the questions that would be able to do and this is tell you that for you so it's a picture it's a film of you washing your so you guys must host washing my own hands the way I wash\nEvery day [noise]\nI Do wash my hands quite often like for example if any for touch my mobile I feel like okay sure I wash my hands before I eat anything because I'm just touch my mobile even if I go to ...

Iquitos exactly and then it asks you\nHow you feel after you've watched yourself wash your hands and now how disgusted or anxious you failed\nYes so it's also the same set of questions to measure like is it better for watching video or was it was after watching with you\nOh you washing your hands as much as you were before the trial or or do you think it's had\nSome sort of lost in fact if I keep on watching videos for us\n[noise] lectures my mind I was like okay you're going to ... so I can see a little bit different struck we'll ...\nWe'll be talking to professor Barbara Sahakian one of the developers all of the brain training at ... who's findings wicked in scientific reports\nMany of these people wash their hands so many times a day that they can damage the hand some of them get so extreme they put bleach on their hands and because they're worried about the contamination touching things that other people have touched maybe getting some disease sometimes they can't even leave their own house because they're worried that anything they touch\nWill you know a contaminate them\nI'm wants treatments currently exist\nSo there's two main treatments one is cognitive behavioral therapy and it's a special for them it's called exposure and response prevention\nSo in that therapy they asked psychologists would actually ask you to sort of maybe ... around the edge of a toilet seat maybe even put your hands in the toilet and then they wouldn't let you\nGo and wash your hands so what happens is anxiety goes way out in these people as you can imagine because they're worried about this contamination\nBut eventually it subsides and when they can't wash their hands anymore they realize that actually there were All right there's nothing wrong\nSo it isn't effective treatment and many people but not for everybody and also as you can imagine many people don't want to undergo that treatment because it's too stressful for them to do it and it causes too much anxiety\nAnother treatment as the selective serotonin ... taken him a disease of drugs\nThat are used also in the treatment of depression the ss our eyes drugs like Prozac\nBut again I'm about forty percent of patients are don't don't really get a good response to treatment\nBut yours you maintain your brain training out is more effective what's the thinking behind well the thinking behind\nThat was the first of all also when you have to do the CBP therapy you have to go into a specialized hospital I have to make an appointment it's expenses sometimes it's an inpatient treatment\nAnd that now with the new technology we should be able to use these new technologies for you know developments and the twenty first century I'm going to a meeting on those therapies for that at the world society and Academy of medical sciences\nAnd we should really use this new technology and get it into play and the idea behind it was well perhaps if you watched\nW UCI sustaining members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nItself so there were two different types of happened both seem to be effective actually\nSo you're getting the person to reflect if you like on their behavior\nYes so they they really when they look at the at the some of them said you know I I used to not be able to go on the bus but now I can go on the U.S because if I get worried that I've touched something I just can look at the uh myself washing my hands on the up and I feel fine I'm not anxious stressed or anything like that\nAnd then with the other one um which is more akin to the CBP therapy\nThey would say things like I used to be able to uh not be able to touch them been or used a cloth twice they used to have to throw it away if I was wiping accounted but now I realize that actually this nothing nothing wrong with using it twice rinsing it out or when I touched been I don't need to rush away and wash my hands\nSo what sort of says has have you had with those using this some brain training him\nSo we have a certain measures of this kind of obsessive compulsive symptoms and they were reduced by about Twenty one to twenty five percent so that was a good reduction because they've only use the F for one week stuff they used it for longer than it might even have a better effect but that was quite a good reduction\nAnd also it affects their ability to a\nCognitive abilities so they're not so rigid in their cognitive thinking anymore they're not so habitually can sort of think of

south China Sea and wishing here a change of strategy by China\n[noise] um no I think that China's always actually in the past couple of years especially stress too on the un member states and that it is willing to host a an and conduct\nAnd military a maritime exercises and joint drills so I think this is just the an opportune time where they've all parties have seen that there is a necessity to have some sort of confidence building exercises and measures and they're taking each other up of a up on that offer\nBut the countries involved um I have not given up the territorial claims you know the south China Sea\nNo they haven't so this is really I'm In a way it's it's putting that aside for now and that is a long term issue that that is not going to be solved in terms of deciding which features belong to whom\nI'm the hope is that at in the meantime at least these countries can come together learn from each other build some sort of trust a and make sure that if there's any sort of maritime emergency in the south China Sea they have a basis to work with each other on it\nAnd is China's thinking that all these countries might come to look upon the United states is the common enemy [noise]\nUm I think China um is certainly worried about the position of the United states I'm In the south China Sea as one that is not going away as the one that will will continue to reinforce its bilateral multilateral relationships in that region\nUm but it is at the same time going to uh exercise it's its own efforts to try and build upon its own bilateral multilateral relationships there\nWe do we stand with some international jurisdiction international rulings on who wins walked in the south China Sea\nWe have no international ruling on who owns what in the south China Sea we have international ruling of course as a result of the permanent court of arbitration finding and she doesn't sixteen which are ruled on the nature of the features\nTerritory they had around them but they made no ruling whatsoever on the sovereignty of those features\nSo um it's still up for grabs this is what she was saying and whoever hangs on to want to have a a gets to keep\nWell um it's definitely going to be difficult to say that countries who occupy certain features at the moment will suddenly relinquish them I'm not by ah like I said that sovereignty feature at sovereignty issue is going to be an issue that these countries are are going to be working on in a very long timeframe\nSo China or the United states do you do you see the the potential for more conflict and has occurred in the south China Sea before\nBetween the United states and China on um I mean the the near collision that we saw recently uh between a Chinese and American ship\n'em was certainly worrying I'm On the United states that have been reports that have come out of the United states saying that um they will step up exercises\nUm in the south China Sea that is likely to aggravate China but I think it's important to note that that neither China nor the United states are looking for war looking for conflict in that region that is hugely destabilizing um and that is exactly what these types of of exercises in simulations are for\nUm which is why we see this type of re engagement this push to try and build that trust\nIs knowing so many things that was a ... a research fellow at the royal

us environmentally friendly alternative\nAnd better recycling chains and so on we know that the vast majority of plastics that enter the ocean are coming from Europe that coming from other parts of the world to take early\nMost problematic are are those countries that don't have good strong formal or well managed waste management system and it doesn't sound like a very exciting thing to do what a waste management says ... it's actually vitally important to have good flows of collection drew chew recycling and other ways of managing white springs\nDon't you tell you there's been talk about

political plastic so creating something that has some of the same property has plastic can perform\nDifferently when released into the environment not damaging and there's lots of innovation around approaches election soldiers innovation over policy that's an opportunity as well as creating attractive recycled materials that people can use as well there's there's loads of opportunity\nCould I ask at least our question today it's at but I don't use it it up on on just production of these\nProducts that doesn't appear to be a ban on plastics in certain products which would be a huge fan I'm

they'll spent days munching on the grass in the fields will they hear people were actually starting to feed their livestock hey inside a ledge and June and July because the ... for the ...\nThe real kind of extreme weather like that and then you know the the contractors in the winter when we were under snow for for five months on just make everything so what's harder you know just getting around the harder it just makes everything that little bit harder here's what we need to do it as far as as we need to look at the last fifty years and\nWe need to look at what the Next Fifty years on hold
