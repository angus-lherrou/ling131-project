large chunk of my conversation has twice a single topic after a while I got a little obsessed with the topic and he started asking people about it directly that generally elected in size and drones

initially angry and then I settle in and say turn up the tunes gets modified going and just relax it's either that or take advantage and I don't have a prescription yet so\nThose were commuters we tracked down in Atlanta and Chicago\nTraffic something that affects the health mental state wallets family life and work options as so many Americans which kind of makes you wonder could traffic be fixed or is it just destined to track us in our cars for more and more times each year\nThere's general agreement the congestion in our major urban areas is getting worse\nMichael ... is an associate professor of urban planning at UCLA Luskin school of public affairs his focus is traffic and he says if you live in or near a major urban area you probably spend a chunk of your day in gridlock\nLos Angeles New York Washington DC that metropolitan area San Francisco Boston Chicago Atlanta in general the bigger and denser city you are the more traffic congestion your roads have\nRush hours have expanded as we try to avoid driving at the worst times a day stresses grown as people grapple with the unpredictability of traffic so one day it can take thirty minutes to get to work and the next day takes fifty and that costs don't end there\nOne of the most under appreciated impacts of traffic congestion is the pollution that results from it\nWhen vehicles are idling and moving slowly are just going stop and go around ten to Fifteen miles an hour they amid much more pollution\nOr they met more carbon which sort of matters for climate change and sort of these global concerns\nBut at a local level they're likely to him that much more sort of what we call local emissions or a local pollutants like fine particulate matter or benzene and things like that and these have been strongly associated with increases in asthma increase and other respiratory diseases or increases and cancer\nAnd most especially increases in a premature birth and low birth weight\nThose costs Mandel says are mostly born by people whose homes are between five hundred and a thousand feet from the congested road which means that not all of the costs associated with traffic are paid by people who drive a lot\nOf the drivers who suffer from last time it's the drivers who suffer from stress it's the drivers who suffer from most crashes but you also have people who just live near freeways and those folks tend to be a much lower income than the population at large and they breathe or very polluted air\nThere's a reason why we don't have chronic shortages of those goods or we don't have blackouts every day we don't have the toilets backup every day we don't have massive shortages of heating fuel every day a big part of the reason for that is that we allocate those things by price right\nWe don't say you can have as much electricity as you want go for it and just see how it works out\nExactly and we ... and so we understand that to officially allocate those vital pieces of infrastructure\nUm we need to price them we also understand that putting those prices in place can be a big burden for some folks who don't have a lot of money and that's why virtually every state every utility\nWhen you contribute to WC a you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on everyday support double UCI at Cape and islands dot org\nAbsolutely no reason that we couldn't do the same thing with congestion prices\nHow do you know it works and where has it been tried like where can I go to see this\nOkay so I think there's two ways to think about this one is that if you just think conceptually about what traffic congestion is\nThen you you understand the pricing is the only thing that solve that problem so again if you understand the congestion results because of very valuable asset is under priced and so as a result too many people want to use it at a particular time\nThan just logically the only thing that is going to ameliorate that\nIs making it more expensive at that time ... so that's like sort of just the the logical or conceptual basis behind it if you want to see it in action Singapore has used some version of congestion pricing\nSince Nineteen Seventy five I Believe wow and it has used sort of more sophisticated electronic road pricing since the late Nineteen nineties early to thousands a Singapore is a very dense city it's desert in San Francisco\nIt's freeways move pretty consistently at fifty five or sixty miles an hour oh you can also see examples of this along certain\nWhat we call high occupancy toll lanes throughout the United states that's our Ninety One roadway in in orange county for instance is a great example it's congestion priced roadway that sits in the middle of a free freeway in orange county okay and\nDuring rush hour you will see traffic snarled in the free lanes and zipping right along at fifty five sixty miles an hour\nAnd the price planes a variant of congestion pricing is it at work in places like London in Stockholm where driving into the center\nOf the city and this is not freeways but this is driving into the downtown you encourage charge to do so\nUh that it's been very successful as well the first day of London's congestion charging traffic delay went down by about thirty five percent\n[noise] so this is an issue that crosses party line it's not partisan doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican if you're you know stuck in traffic every morning\nOn but I have not heard a lot of politicians talk about it do you see we've kind of a local thing but you see mayors governors I'm Talking about this doing congestion pricing really trying to\nA better so congestion is absolutely a much bigger priority at the local and sometimes state level than it is it's a national level right it's not something that the national government has a lot of concern or authority over\nAnd it's also just not something that even if you look at polls you know if you ask them to American and a Gallup poll or something like his congestion bad they say yes but if you ask them like name the top three problems in your region\nOnly in a handful of regions just congestion rank really high mhm so I think it it becomes much more an issue that mayors and city council members out and in smaller states like Massachusetts governors tackle\nAnd the question of you know\nDo I see these little acted officials embracing congestion pricing\nWhat I Would say optimistically is that more people are willing to talk about it now than they were ten years ago\nI think it's a hard political cell I mean this is people are very accustomed to the roads being free\nThey're also very accustomed to unfortunately policymakers having told them to other things would solve congestion being told that because we're building transit or adding road capacity\nThe problem was going to get better so I think it's been difficult to sort of go back on that and say actually we were wrong the only thing that's going to solve this is pricing\nBut I I'm optimistic that as more and more places many of them outside the United states uh experiment with this mayors in the United states will look around and say you know there's no reason we shouldn't be part\nOf the success Michael ... is an associate professor of urban planning at the UCLA unless ... school of public affairs his research focuses on traffic Michael thank you so much\nMy name and then\nYou heard from some commuters in Atlanta and Chicago at the beginning of the segment we asked us what the world will look like without

I think that's so interesting to like hone in on that the the potential problem with the is seven behaviors beyond potentially if you you know believe in how the fact that you might go to hell on but beyond that\nAnd it's the shining a you know other people shining that doing these things will lead people to say I don't want to hang out with you or there's something wrong with you I don't like what you've got\nYeah exactly and if you guys read them one by one slough\nWe humans throughout history and also in the present day um have been relying on one another and so if someone's lazy and not pulling their weight not doing their fair share of the work then why should they benefit from an equal division of the bounty that results from ... work if someone thinks that\nThe center of the universe the right price for the narcissistic\nIf they treat everyone else is the ... second class citizens compared to themselves why in the world would you reciprocate an entrenched evenly with them ... you know we humans are an intensely social\nSpecies with ... reliant on one another's cooperation and if we go too far in these anti social behaviors than other people\nWill withhold that cooperation and and basically be like stuff you if you how you feel about things then off you go see how you get on your own\n... and I talked before about these two less right the seven deadly sins and the ten commandments why did you write about the seven deadly sins and not about the ten commandments\nUm well it was because of the number seven so as the as you alluded to\nThere is a nice little piece of science George Miller from Princeton University published it in Nineteen fifty six and it was about the magic number seven plus or minus two that was the type of the paper\nAnd among scientists that vaguely humorous but I see the capacity the limit of working memory a back then at least was ... plus or minus the so the average person could remember between five and nine items of information say\nOn average several nights and we can hold in mind\nSimilar tiny asleep for long enough to perform some kind of mental operation with them and so in this case is looking at\nYour conduct an honor to have you that you perhaps thinking of of acting up on a ... thinking of acting upon you think is right or wrong you can quickly run through those a list of\nThe sudden caught in the vices oh deadly sins and then you know that's a nice sort of rule of thumb to ... onto the straight and narrow as opposed to in the ... the other reason was that as a neuroscientist he was raised an icy as I Am I still nonetheless\nSinaloa hymns at school because I went to a stretch of England primary school and secondary school high school\nAs he called it in the states I Am and\n... every morning we sang an assembly and I realized that you know when I finally got out of it or the ... sort of ... stop the Christian moral framework and I was living my life according to it despite not actually believing in code or heaven and hell and I feel that my life was was better off from that led to the idea\nThat religious have been studying human behavior for millennia\nSciences are knee go onto the scene in the last few decades imagining a world without any moral guidance or at least prolific moral guidance that everyone has access to 'em would lead to a worst case scenario\nThan a ... or you know an incredibly strict tight solitaire in the ... like it's almost like nice moral framework and I feel like um things would would fall into disrepair and sense of communities and so forth\nYou're listening to innovation happen turn now I'm Talking with Jack Lew rescues and you're a scientist and author of that but the ... why we do the things we know we shouldn't\nSo let's talk about one of the sense here ... pride which we touched on on a couple of years ago I talked to a professor at the University of British Columbia named Jessica Tracy I'm sure it a whole book about pride and she talked about how sort of paradoxically it can be a really good thing for you\nTo be good students whatever um but she also said it's got this dark side at what she called hubris stick pride so here she is talking about that\nTo our research shows that people who tend to feel this kind of hubris to pride have problematic friendships right they they have trouble making friends and keeping friends because really what they value more is boosting themselves up at the expense of their friends sort of put others down to feel good about themselves they'll have aggressively to try to get power and control\nAnd so the result of that is behaviors that can be really destructive like cheating in line\nJak Lewis I'm probably as one of those really interesting things that's not ... and ... it's not an unalloyed like bad thing it it it has these two sides", "show_name": "Innovation Hub", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "08"}
