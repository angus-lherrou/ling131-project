I had no idea that an epileptic seizure is a disease rather than someone who's been consulting with Satan mhm oh I had no idea circa Nineteen fifties that a child has a lot of trouble learning to read\nRather than being lazy and an motivated has the cortical mal formations that we now call a learning disability and when you look at\nThe sheer percentage of what we know\nAbout the biological shaping of our behavior\nYou know Ninety five percent of it was discovered in the last\nIs twenty five years eighty five percent since you woke up this morning and all that has been happening is this endless march of oh I had no idea of biology had to do with that and it is already convinced is of that and some of our most fundamental areas\nAnd at the end of the day either you could conclude there's no free will whatsoever and that's my spouse or at least you're going to have to admit there's a lot less free will than there used to be\nIn sort of western thinking and western values and judgments\nAnd it's getting squeezed into all sorts of really uninteresting places and that's just gonna keep happening and maybe down the line if you want to insist it was free will while you've lost your upper teeth It's MORNING instead of your lower ones go for it be happy but\nI think by all logic again this notion free will is just the biology we haven't discovered yet\nDoes that mean you must think that all the time in your own life you know am I really choosing to me in primates are if they do that again and I really choosing not to eat that cookie or that already kind of baked into like who I mean do you think that all the time in your own life\nWill that's the problem um you know mid again I'm totally intellectually comfortable with the notion that there is no free will whatsoever it's a myth we are nothing more or less than her biology at the same time I haven't the remotest idea\nHow you're supposed to live a few actually started to believe in me\nThere's obvious things to do which is completely revamp\nHow we do criminal justice and education and all sorts of other things like that\nBut at the end of the day like you know without question I show that I'm a total hypocrite and there's not really incorporate thinking [laughter] because like if I give a lecture\nAnd somebody comes up afterward and says oh good lecture I'll say thanks also when I'm supposed to say no actually it's this amount to you I have my having adequate protein levels as a fetus on this and this is my called\nRight yeah yeah and like how do you function that way I'm a certain level if it's good to be hard for us to accept that there's no free will when it comes to judging them and they're awful behaviors I'm going to be that much harder should acceptance absolutely justice\nOnce I I Want to go back to something that you just mentioned the criminal justice system so believing what you do how do you think about this system that's all about choices people make and then how other people obviously choose to punish them or not punish them uh for for what they did\nWell not to sound like too much of a hot here as if I haven't already but\nLet's see just to sort of stayed at subtly the criminal justice system makes no sense whatsoever there's there's no souls there's no evil\nThere's no there's no punishment that in and of itself I mean none of the stuff makes sense that the criminal justice system runs on neurobiology that's close to two hundred years old\nLiterally in what's called McNaughton ruling the difference between ... between right and wrong and other than that for most parts ignored the last two hundred years of behavioral science twenty five percent of the men on death row in this country has a history of can cause of head trauma to their frontal cortex\nAnd when you damage the frontal cortex\nUs somebody who can know the difference between right and wrong and they still can't regulate their behavior and when they do something appalling that point invoking evil it makes much sense as invoking the notion of evil on a car who's breaks the failed hit somebody ...\nAnd in both cases you don't leave them out on the street being dangerous but when you put a car in a garage because he can't fix the brakes and dangerous you don't sit there and say justice has been served\nAnd there's cars not going to get to drive around in the countryside anymore on a sunny day is just\nA mechanical problem and in a horribly simplified way we're biological machines and if it's ... to turn listened to machines in that way it's a hell of a lot better than demonizing us into having rotten souls when we may just have something screw with wonder transmitted system\nIn some ways at the argument that you make\nReally affects huge swaths of our culture it seems to me like I think about the entire section of a bookstore I'm right that is designed to help you succeed Martin life so that you know books to help you find that to help you succeed at word books doubt you do well in school I can make friends better\nAnd but there is no need for that section if it's pre determined whether you're going to succeed at work\nWe'll but nonetheless you've got to incorporate the fact in there that behavior changes yeah\nAnd it's not determined to stick in the sense that like a puritan neurobiologist would have set a Plymouth Rock or something but it's instead in a much more interesting hopeful way for example\nI'm conventional language that we would use you sit there and you hear about the story of Hugh Thompson and you come out of their inspired inspired\nShe did something amazing inspired\nThere was nothing extraordinary about his upbringing\nInspired five minutes before that he was no more amazing when you were me put his pants on one leg at a time it's after a while maybe I could be more like Hugh Thompson ... so we've just given sort of in the English description of what it is to be inspired by somebody\nWhat does that neural biologically and the fact that a human can do what she did\nAnd the fact that you just heard about it\nMight very well change something in your ... and two and a half more neurons than we're working this way this morning are now involved in a sense of advocacy ... and doing the right thing when it's the terrifying thing to do\nWhen you're inspired when you're demoralized when you're deflated when you're bored by something those are as biological phenomena as anything else and they leave their traces so the fact that\nUm men in the early Nineteen hundreds who owned an amusement park and he actually use the power that corporations had gained a to protect his own civil rights ah so the man who own the amusement park\nOr with African American and he was sued by folks in Virginia who were saying and this and we don't want all these African Americans coming into our neighborhood to go to this amusement park on and meet her was actually able to defend himself because corporations had such extensive rights I Do want to talk about that case\n[noise] sure it was a case involving like you're saying amusement park for African Americans are in Virginia back at around the turn of the century and the local neighbors sued or trying to put the amusement park out of business because they said on the African Americans were not allowed to buy the land that the amusement park was located on\nOkay was that in the law the average or not allowed to buy that land\nWas not the law so that African Americans couldn't bought a land it was there were restrictions in the deed of land okay that you could not be sold to African Americans okay okay um this was a racially restrictive covenant the common place way in which racial segregation was enforced in America and the Jim Crow era\nAnd the court nonetheless ruled in favor of the amusement park saying that uh the amusement park was not owned by African Americans was owned by a corporation corporation may have been run by African Americans but the corporation had no race itself the court said I'm a and a really highlights\nYou got the history of corporate rights is that in many ways it the rights of corporations became tied up with questions of race slavery and civil rights just like almost anything else in American history\nTo go back to Mitt Romney that that famous quote you know corporations are people couldn't you argue and I I guess corporate who's probably has that you know look corporations are a collection of people and\nUm their interests you know when they fight for their interests whether it's talking about terrorists or whatever it is they are fighting to keep their workforce to not have to lay people off to be profitable to share those profits\nUm isn't that in some you know I think ... you know people derided Mitt Romney but isn't that\nA reasonable way to look at things they'd corporations are a collection of people and they're trying to act in their best interest\nThat is exactly the way the Supreme Court has tended to view corporations over the course of American history and the for all the controversy over corporate personhood\nCitizens United never relies on that idea at all and in fact what I find in my book is that if you look at the history of Supreme Court cases extending rights to corporations\nWe find that most of those cases the Supreme Court rejects the idea of corporate personhood and says instead the corporations are associations of people and that people come together in the corporate form and they shouldn't lose their rights when they do so but there are some interesting questions about who really belongs to the corporation\nWhen Hobby Lobby refuses to provide birth control is required under federal law\nAnd health care plans for employees\nUm that's you know ten thousand female employees who are adversely affected by that there isn't a that is made by a to pursue the interests of the four or five owners of the Hobby Lobby company um whose interest really should be a recognized the the people who contribute the money or the people who contribute the labor and everything else\nCan you imagine a whole bunch more cases coming down the pike like as more CEOs get active and get involved um I think a bank of America that just a few months ago said they didn't want to finance companies that that make a weapons like the air Fifteen\nAh we've seen Patagonia sue the Trump Administration over\nA national monuments protection national monuments\nI just wonder if there's going to be a whole new crop of these cases that like test the power of corporations we're really seeing ...\nAnd we're seeing lawsuits brought against graphics cigarette warnings we're seeing lawsuits brought against conflict mineral disclosures under the securities laws and and do you buy one study a full fifty percent of all First Amendment cases brought today abroad by corporations and trade associations that represent them\nI didn't Winkler is a law professor at UCLA he's the author of the new book we the corporations how American business as one their civil rights Adam thank you very much\nThanks so much for having [noise] we\nTalked earlier about a lawyer Who Lied to the Supreme Court saying that the directors of the fourteenth amendment which gave rights to former slaves meant to give rights to companies do well that man former sender Roscoe ... also turned out a nomination to be on the Supreme Court twice [noise]\nHe's actually the last person in American history declined an appointment to the point\nWe're going to have more on him and his strange and extraordinary life\nAt our website innovation hub shot [noise]\nJust ahead didn't living during the pandemic at the twentieth century Neal night\nA lot of people thought they were in a sort of sort of ... you know that it was the end they had as I should this huge um punishment from go\nFrom here I Am WG beach radio I'm Karen Miller and miss is innovation hub backing them support for innovation hub comes from Northeastern University\nOver the past decade northeastern has taken a signature co-op program around the world with opportunities for students on all seven continents you can learn more at northeastern dot edu [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWhy oh why oh\nWhy oh why oh why oh\n\n\n\nWell come back to innovation I'm ...\nAnd the fall of Nineteen eighty a man in his mid thirties got sick\nHe was a relatively powerful man and assistant secretary of the American navy and by the time he got sick it was clear that his illness was part of an epidemic sweeping the clothes and know that assistant secretary whose name was Franklin Delano Roosevelt did get better already actually went on to contract polio a few years later\nThe illness that sickened him in Nineteen Eighteen reshaped our world it was the Spanish flu which might not roll off your tongue when you think about the most important events of the twentieth century\nBut it killed between fifty in a hundred million people\nPossibly more people than the first and Second World wars come by so what happened was they would stop out\nWith the same symptoms of flu that you and I know in a normal flu season if we're lucky sore throat fever headache\nAnd then the unlucky minority would have to trouble breathing they would ten blue in the face would tend to black and at that point and it was really no chance of recovery on it depended on the individual but to take hours or days um but they would die\nWorst beneath the author of the book pale writer the Spanish flu Nineteen Eighteen and how it changed the world and she says by the time the flu came along the world had been at war for years and people are exhausted\nAll other people's ... and you know that that it was the end they had invited this huge um punishment from\nGood the Spanish flu which by the way it was not Spanish it was cold Spanish because Spain printed more information about the flu than many other countries\nIt killed at least thirty times more people than die in a regular flu season it also altered the way we think about all sorts of things from viruses to preparing for pandemics so is the Spanish flu something that society has confined to the dustbin of history\n... says may all come down to the power of narrative\nI think that would lend themselves much more easily to storytelling than mine them makes you know that\nIndependent and there's a sort of beginning a middle and an end where the Spanish flu just just struck people will completely wilted and then it had practically gone by the time they realized what had hit them so as you said even though it was a much bigger disaster in terms of the number of victims it kind of got lost in the easiest stories you tell\nMhm I Wonder too if in some ways the Spanish flu kind of like World War one with a lot more lethal warfare then we'd ever seen was the story of like the modern world emerging and you know I told that story by FDR", "year":
