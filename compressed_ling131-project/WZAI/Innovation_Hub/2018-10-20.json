Abigail Roberts in what she was only six team and the poster came out there was an advertisement for flowers to use her baking which seems like just about the most innocuous thing in the world\n... wasn't the year was Nineteen oh too and what Roberts and saw horrified her she saw herself the picture she had posed for in a photography studio which the flower manufacturer Franklin mills had somehow gotten a hold of\nThe tapes over whether the company was entitled to this private picture\nHurt suit begins at kind of whole chain of cases and state courts around the use of one's image without ones permission\nSarah I Do is an associate professor of history at Vanderbilt University and she says today's worries about privacy aren't all that new in fact\nThere were a rash of technologies in the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds that me people feel like privacy was being stolen from them technologies like photography particularly instant photography and mass media and if you can believe it postcards\nWhen postcards came on board of course anyone could read the back of a postcard from the mail carrier to a nosy neighbor and so there's this you know small but I think very interesting and telling ... around the etiquette of postcard writing that people shouldn't be selling their secrets on these cards\nThe rise of telephones also seemed to many in the public like a serious violation of privacy\nTelephone operators a wire tappers of various sorts party lines in um domestic telephone communications all of these men that people were communicating with each other about private matters but that a whole bunch of people could potentially at any point\nBe listening in on the same was true for the telegraph in terms of communications over telegraph cables both government and criminals or various sorts it was well known could could tap into those communications\nSarah ... new book is the known citizen a history of privacy in modern America\nAnd she argues that the story of privacy isn't linear we didn't have a whole bunch of privacy and some previous era that we continue to lose piece by piece what we want to but we demand what we hope for\nHe keeps changing which brings us back to Abigail Robertson the girl who was shocked to see herself on the flower poster\nRobertson one her case in court but when she got the state level on appeal she lost her last enraged the public\nThe chief judge Bolton Parker said there was no quote so called writer privacy Parker was pilloried but he went on to run for president against Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd if you've never heard of ... and Parker well you know what happened in that election the U.S meanwhile kept grappling with new inventions and ideas that required often compromises in our privacy\nSocial Security numbers were one of those that that I think Americans really weighed and made a trade off about that this number which did allow the government to track\nDeveloping openness rate in revealing who we really are and not having shame about that right so stigmas are falling away yet\nPrivate data is becoming more valuable uh so those those are different pieces of privacy but they're moving in different directions\nSo fast forwarding a little bit\nAnd it has affected privacy both kind of real privacy and then like our perception of the privacy that we have\nUm so the Internet is a huge topic for privacy of course I'm One of the things the Internet did was make opting out more difficult of giving away wins information of presuming that you intended to share and disseminate a\nYour personal details unless you very carefully and deliberately opted out and that really rivers as\nDanah boyd has written about this really nicely that really reversed a tradition where it was actually hard to get information was hard to get information out and to circulate it it flip flop that so that that was a hugely important part of the Internet and the way that it's intersected with privacy debates it also of course gave\nAmericans who have long um many long wanted an audience of some kind right and\nA kind of influence and reach exactly that gave them a platform for their blog for their\nThoughts for you know sharing their photographs of their meals [laughter]\nYou know giving allowing their friends to see their movements it allowed people to do what they've been doing since the days of the postcard which is you know share information about themselves and and so those those two facets um again have come together and really powerful ways in the\nUh ability of now many many many people to look into and use that information in ways that we're not always intended of course by the people who put it out there to begin with\n[laughter] let me just take a step out of history here for a minute ... will step back into it for a minute but I think in some ways people think of like history is a story of privacy mean off straight you know your last summer with the with uh the telephone people can listen in the calls and the telegraph\nAnd then the Internet and you know and closed circuit TV cameras all of our city that you just keep going and people know more and more about you\nBut in some sense if I if you think back to like medieval in London or something people living very close together walls being not very thick you can just hear what people are saying on the other side you know or people in living in very small villages in small communities where everybody knows everybody and everybody knows everybody's business\nIn some ways like tomorrow if I Walk through Rio or Beijing or like New York city\nWould know who I was I mean I can walk through anonymously and maybe privately I mean in some ways I feel like you could argue that we maybe have more privacy than we had hundreds of years ago\n[noise] absolutely I think this is what has missed often in our contemporary debates this I\nThat was there once and is now gone and or eroding\nSlipping for our fingers but no it's true that we live privately\nMore privately in many ways then did people a couple of centuries ago in terms of a White House construction ways that neighborhoods are designed homes are designed but also in terms of our very rights and our sensibilities sense of what should be private um has changed and so it I think it's really a mistake to think about privacy its own moving in one direction\nUm this is what makes it hard to chart and hard to kind of place in any given point but it's it's ... and in certain ways even though perhaps we have less privacy in our communications today or around our personal information\nSay um it's accessibility to others\nWe have more privacy I think some ways in ways we live in the way we think about ourselves as private up people who are not to have the state or neighbors peering in through our windows all the time [noise] so\nWhat's your diagnosis of where we are now are we in like a lot less private than we were a hundred years ago [noise]\nI don't think so but I Do think that the substance of our privacy in our ideas about privacy rights or\nHave changed and changed in conjunction with all kinds of things technological developments state developments a commercial or and so on architectural even I think if I were to describe our current moment I think what we're experiencing are\nTwo different trajectory is coming together and have created a lot of problems I'm One of them\nIs the ability for many different agencies to know us very well um by matching emerging technologies the other is this a impetus that many citizens have had since the Nineteen seventies to disclose more of their authentic selves on different kinds of media platforms right\nThose are coming together in ways that are I think um we're unanticipated and which have meant that there is a ton of information out there about us some of it uh kept by record keepers some of it disclosed voluntarily by us um and and then we've got we're in this technological and commercial moment where all of that is valuable to others\nAnd there are many many ways to harness it so those two things have come together they didn't they didn't necessarily have to come together but they have and I think that explains are a scandal late in a\nMoment you know firm Equifax to Cambridge Analytica and whatever is next to\nSara

[noise]\n[noise]\nBack to innovation hubs internal\nDivide you see over and over and politics is on the question of how much the government get involved and how much did they get involved with regulating guns or reproductive options are taking money in taxes on this list of what the government auditor or not to get involved in he probably never seen the issue of rowing rights\nAnd why would you well says author Seamus ... this is no ordinary race\nThe story here is that a few years back there is a a farmer rancher and a west Texas in arid west Texas a by the name of Williams Jeff Williams\nWilliams and his family had their rights to a ton of water in Texas that they can pump out of the aquifer under their land no matter how dry Texas got to the state Supreme Court had told them\nWhat it basically comes down to is that an individual landowner has the right to literally pull up as much water as they possibly can and as long as it's used for quote more or less\nThat's the end of it it boils down to whoever has the biggest pump wins in the Williams is that among the the bigger pumps\nMcGraw is the author of a Thursday land the making of an American and water crisis he said that what Jeff Williams could not do by law we ship the water to other people who needed it\nEven when drought began to plague Texas in two thousand ten and even when that ... was forcing some farmers to abandon their crops\nJeff Williams thought the situation was curious to say the least\nHe reads the newspaper the well you know what forty thousand acres of rice or being let go oh I'm a I'm a far you know what I'm going to do I'm going to raise rice\nIn the district now to be fair it was only a small part it was only a few acres was a test part [noise] it was more to make a point but it was to actually make a profit\nThe point was that despite the fact that race is generally grown in places like Southeast Asia or monsoons dot the landscape with rain the Williams is can grow rice in the desert in the middle of a drought\nAnd not McGraw argues tells us a lot about where we're headed with water not just in Texas but in the country as a whole\nYou have the abdication of the federal to the state the abdication of the state to the local and ultimately the abdication of the local to the individual and\nThat becomes I think that's a powerful challenge and how Texas response to this challenge is instructive for how the rest of us are going to respond to the challenges for fish\nWhat we're facing the nation increasingly played by both lack of water droughts forest fires and too much water much of it unsafe for contaminated\nUp until now water has been a classic government versus the individual struggle in America politics by another name but it can't stay that way McGraw says when we're struggling to find enough water for people in lots of American cities Las Vegas Los Angeles Phoenix\nSomething's got to get in Texas for him most clearly encapsulates that lesson\nIt's not an accident that for much of the southwest for example when they first became part of the United states they were very sparsely populated mhm they were very sparsely populated because they could\nPopulation and technology has changed that to me it's hard to imagine a Phoenix before air conditioning for example I mean the Phoenix today\nThere could be no Phoenix before before air conditioning there could be no El Paso there could be no there could be no San Antonio today\nWere it not for the technological advancements that have taken place and particularly took place in the post war era\nSo ... so the implication is here that we put too many people um or that they put themselves in the Las Vegas is in the Phoenix is in the past those certainly given the amount of water that we have and those places and\nI'll I'll just say on behalf of those people like what I mean these are major areas of economic importance and cultural important are you saying in Thirty years
