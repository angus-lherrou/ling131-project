an election especially election that's clubs in two thousand sixteen late shift in three states that often vote democratic Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania turned out to be especially important in handing Donald Trump an electoral college victory\nIn Oxford University study found that those three states would have voted for Hillary Clinton if their use robots have been just two percent lower\nIt happens she'd be the press\nThey don't agree at all as to whether the problem with the economy and all the political fallout that it's caused this technology or whether they're real problem is us\nFirst step Brian Alexander has chronicled has several swing states had the effect of completely shifting or politics from Obama to Trump\nTo whatever comes next he's the author of glass house the one percent economy and the shattering of an all American town and he recently wrote about automation and the MIT tech review Bryan welcome thank you it's a great pleasure to be here so\nYour book came out in two thousand Seventeen after the two thousand sixteen election but you continue to report the story particularly focusing on Ohio which where you're from and obviously we're right up against another election right now\nWhat's your sense of whether anything has changed in the last couple of years ...\nYes I I I mean I think some attitudes have changed somewhat I think ah speaking specifically about Donald Trump I think there is\nSome chagrin among some people who voted for Trump in states like Ohio who are not pleased with his behavior\nOn the other hand I think there is a reluctance to sort of admit to that because so many\nPeople you know who are very broadly generalize over generalize as the the so called elite or the coastal elites or whatever I've been telling people that they made this huge mistake and so there's a there's a big reluctance to admit they made a mistake it's sort of like when you've been swindled nobody wants to open up to it\nSo I think there's still a lot of support for Donald Trump or almost as an act of defiance against people who\nAre doing well you know often there's this um mocking among\nSome of my colleagues frankly about the you know they talk about oh economic and security wink wink nudge nudge when it was really racism or something else\nThe fact is it's not just economic insecurity insecurity about everything it's cultural insecurity gets insecurity about money and politics and where they stand in the world now uh the ground has shifted under their feet\nThat feeling is still there in these places and in fact might be stronger than ever ...\nUm you read about a study that estimated that close to seven hundred thousand jobs um I had been lost automation between Nineteen sixty seven and two dozen fourteen do people feel like Donald Trump\nThe whole story the corporation fundamentally was reorganized sometime between Nineteen Seventy like lady in a new way that created more insecure lives for the rest of

dividing line between the jobs that have dates fairly steady and those that are new on the scene will technology obviously except says historian Lewis\nNot really he says American businesses have loved the idea of freelancing for a long time not just in this era of Internet startups in very low unemployment rate and the shift in the economy that we're seeing not about tech it's about us and the choices we make\nLewis timing is an associate professor of economic history at Cornell University he's the author of temp how American work American business in the American dream became temporary Lewis thanks for your time a real pleasure to be here thank you so when you hear people say things and I'm sure this\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nWhen do you think when you hear that kind of complaint [noise]\nIt's really interesting to me because there's a way in which technology acquires sort of an air of inevitability that there's nothing that can be done this is just the future it's algorithms and futuristic robots and in the book I really push back against us pretty strongly\nThat technology is neutral it solves business problems tech doesn't drive change it consolidates it\nAnd things that you think happened in the last few years that are being driven by apps are really the byproduct of you know the rise of a certain kind of surface economy that has been insecure increasingly insecure and unequal for quite some time\nAnd so you wouldn't say then I guess that technology has always driven things and I think people think like\nTechnology is the reason we had the industrial revolution right that if the ... you hadn't had automatic looms and that never would have happened in that the Internet is like I said you know the reason that all of this temporary work has happened ... you just sort of don't buy that argument\nI don't and I don't think many historians do either it's really important to realize and it's and it's a story we're told so there's a reason why I Do think it's not just because they're you know confused at there this is the story we're told that the story of progress the story of technology you know the cotton gin and the steam engine in the railroad\nBut before all that was made possible there was a social reorganization of people are from their homes into the factories\nAnd the what historians called industrious revolution which preceded the industrial revolution by about a hundred years the ... revolution the industry is Rob a bank not that people became suddenly moral and hardworking uh but that they were\nPut into rooms together and supervised and you know they were leaving textiles they were\nYou know making pots pottery and they had nothing to do with technology and how to do with simply\nOrganizing people in a row and watching them this is where Adam Smith famous example of pin manufacturing came from right it wasn't you know the idea of division of labor that you know one person could make you know fewer I sat down to make a PIN we could make like three pinned I could make zero pins I'm not very hit it makes you know all that but let's\nExactly but if you sit down thirty people and you break down that process in the separate step suddenly oh maybe I can I can definitely hit something in a certain way again and again and again and that these Skilling of work that division of labor this is the foundation of\nCapitalism and a lot of ways it's one of the foundations of capitalism\nAnd this is what we're seeing today that the corporation fundamentally was reorganized some time or between Nineteen Seventy Nineteen eighty\nIn a new way that created more insecure lives for the rest of us and ... is the waste product of that service economy it's the it's only possible because the rest of our work lives at Starbucks in Wal Mart or so bad\n... so if what you're saying is in some sense factories were created before the kinds of factories we think about where so many things are automatic and electric powered\nTalk about then how the gig economy was there before even before the Internet forget Hoover and the Internet ever came on but it was really there before\nAbsolutely so in the book I talk about temp jobs and by temp jobs I mean jobs that are loosely affiliated with a corporation or a workplace and you can see them in all kinds of ways from consultants which are well paid to temps which are run through an agency to migrant laborers\nOr which are pretty much shut out of any kind of legal protections or workplace rights so\nThe story really begins after World War two when the first temp agencies come into being when the first\nConsulting fees really comes with the foreground so here I'm Talking about manpower incorporated as before for runner the temp agency and McKinsey and company as a foreigner of consultants and of course at the same time the ... program which brought guest workers from Mexico to the U.S for the very first time\nTalk a little bit about man power a which is still going strong it's a company that exist today but it started in the Nineteen forties before we think about the gig economy just talking about like the guy\nYou started it and what it was hoping to do and sort of how it ended up changing America\nSo all these different kinds of temp work really whereabouts supporting that postwar corporation that was focused on security focused on stability and long term jobs and so the founder of manpower incorporated Elmer winter was a lawyer\nIn Milwaukee and one day he had a crisis where he needed a secretary to type up some\nHe didn't have one so he called around he couldn't find somebody and he realized that this was not a problem this was an opportunity like so many entrepreneurs and so he founded manpower as a way to supply emergency replacement labor for\nBusiness executives and for companies and this was a tremendous growth business they exploded through the Nineteen fifties\nThe by the Nineteen end of the Nineteen fifties he realize there was a limit to how often secretaries got sick or ... you know people went on vacation and you begin to imagine a different kind of workforce of workforce that could come in as needed that can be a permanent the temporary workforce\nAnd yet people didn't do it and they didn't do it because of the reasons they didn't have the experience with it they trusted the people that they knew\nAnd they didn't quite believe that that was the purpose of the company the purpose of the company was to provide security to provide long term investments and all the things that are missing in the meaning of the corporation today\nSo then how did he had an manpower convinced corporations can take that next step that just you know replace somebody while they were having surgery or like you said like went on vacation but um you know gee I'm One\nOf your work place or a lot of the people who work you know with you interchangeable you don't have to like make a full time commitment to them\nWhat happened was\nThe first that there was something called the computer that became really important in the mid Nineteen sixties especially the system three sixty by IBM and corporations were entranced by it they were entranced by this idea of losing all their paper records to deter records\nAnd talk to them about how they would use robotics exactly the same way they would use a hammer from here I Am Wu GBH radio I'm Karen Miller and this is innovation hubs back in a minute support for innovation hubs comes from Northeastern University\nOver the past decade northeastern has taken its signature co-op

from our business sponsors whose commitment to W. ca I work on the Cape the coast and the islands is shown to their financial contributions please take the time to let our sponsors know that you've noticed and you appreciate their ongoing support\nTry it for instance when this week we're cooking was America's favorite professional eater jail sentence were swimming and beautiful vinegars learning about that\nAnd we've got a love story about boisterous that's the splendid table the chauffeur curious cooks and heaters from a PS this afternoon\nTo see a on [noise]\nWasn't that innovation and turn them\nRushing headlong\nInto a technological future I mean I guess you could make the argument we been doing it ever since the industrial revolution started but by the U.S has especially accelerated it seems to me in the late Nineteen Seventy in the early eighties\nThat's author Brian Alexander who I talked to earlier in the show about how much new technology like automation and robotics has ended jobs and community especially in places like Ohio where he grew up\nAnd at first it seemed like great promise and there have obviously been many benefits of all this technological change but I think one of the very destructive parts of it has been that it has contributed to this erosion of community\nThat erosion Alexander's that's been particularly powerful in states where factories have substituted robots for people and were solid blue collar jobs now feel scarce but for those who are part of building the technology that drives our lives these sorts of changes have been going on for well ever\nIn the early eighties the job of being a switchboard operator was on its way out\nDaniel Theobald cofounded their bikes company ... and he now serves as their chief innovation officer\nI think in Nineteen eighty four eighty and she had forty thousand switchboard operators today you know a handful at most and nobody really but I Know of is really lamenting the loss of the ability to sit behind a desk and plug wires in and out of the switchboard all day long it wasn't great work\nBut the other side of the equation is really interesting for me at least and that is if you were to try and handle today's communications\nUsing switchboard operators it would take many many times the population of the entire earth\nTechnologies the about argues change they always have people who made their living constructing horse drawn carriage who made dresses to order who had hot chops at a time when men and women\nAll those jobs more or less ultimately came to an end you can't\nTurn back time you know we have one point seven seven six trillion dollars of our Indian investment globally Seventy five percent of that is outside of the United states [noise] Ninety percent of all the science and scientists and engineers who ever lived are alive today\nFormer deputy assistant secretary of defense for research Melissa flag says that even if America wanted to stop the advance of the sorts of technologies that can lead to fewer workers and car manufacturing plants we couldn't really the economy is to globalized this time\nBut that were harkening back to doesn't exist\nAnd so the question isn't\nBut we rushed into it the world has already gone there and in order for us to think about fundamentally improving the lives of the next several generations\nWe have to actually ask them to help us figure out how do you transform were or build totally new types of communities I Do think we're going to have to accept that\nAs new things are created some things that we remember when the soldier will no longer exists\nFlag is now the northeast regional lead at the U.S army research laboratory\nAnd she and Daniel Theobald who started the robotics company agree that the march of technology offers incredible potential for making our lives better but in the short term they say our responsibility is to pay a lot more attention to people who have been displaced\nYou know when the when the person who's been working a certain type of job almost all of their life feels threatened that the world is going to change because of technology that's the real issue and that's a real hard issue to deal with\nSo uh you know we need to do a better job in this country of taking care of those people have training workers of retraining workers have and continuing education but to to blame the robots um ultimately is counterproductive because we will end up in a place where we can't take care of the exact people that that we're trying to protect\nDo you feel like I mean you spent I think pretty much your entire adult life making robots doesn't feel strange when you hear all the sort of\nCoverage in politics in the media about automation and and you know people feeling really alienated and upset because of sort of what technology in robotics doing does it feel weird to be a person who creates robots yeah it does\nIs really important for me throughout the throughout that period of building robots as well as we've really been focused on this idea of how do you encourage humanity how do you make life better for people\nThat's got to be the primary focus and I believe very strongly that technology can do that and by and large technology has done that all the way back to the stone age I'm\nMelissa I I Know you grow up in Missouri and your family had and actually has now a a cotton farm in Arkansas talk about what you see not in Silicon valley not maybe in Boston or New York uh but they're\nSo my hometown Sykes and trucking is the main industry there so there's a lot of conversation that I've had with folks who I Know who live in ... and and their thoughts about listening to conversations about automation\nAnd they're scared and an angry that people talk about it like it's exciting rather than talking about the impact\nWhen I go to the farm the flip side is it's allowed small farms to continue to exist and to actually make enough money to be relevant for families in ways that we couldn't have otherwise because\nHaving precision grading and no till farming and\nQuite frankly Roundup Ready cotton and things like this that have allowed us to do farming with fewer people right I mean those\nTractors are basically robots that have satellite precision you know place the input here and so it's kind of incredible to see both sides of it where it's really enabled individual families to farm in a way that they could never have done and it's increased the yield of this land by\nJust tremendous amounts on the other side right you you see people losing jobs and so I think when you start to have those conversations across communities in the same town it's really exciting because then you start to see these debates between people who really trust each other\nAnd that's an intriguing again it's it's that having the technology is in charge of the conversation is tricky and you learn in D O D because\nEvery single thing that a soldier or an airman or a sailor and marine uses a ship a jet right\nA submarine thirties incredible pieces of technology but these are kids that came out of my home town right and we've trained them to be in this universe and incredibly high tech\nAnd so there are these incredible translators between hey you know\nIt an amazing ways and you don't have to be a PHD computer scientist to do it\nYou're listening to innovation have I'm ... I'm Talking with Daniel Theobald co founder and chief innovation officer of ... robotics and must have flagged the north east region only eat at the U.S army research lab\nDanielle let's talk about another strand of this conversation uh which I think probably doesn't get talked a lot about 'em in in most media um because we're very busy having the jobs in technology conversation\nBut I Wonder how much people in technology worry um that the U.S and maybe because of some of these concerns is falling behind in the world in terms of robotics and automation or art know are we doing great and don't worry about it\nYou know because we have a very high standard of living here and because you know we're several generations in from significant events in the world like World War two et cetera", "show_name": "Innovation Hub", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "27"}
