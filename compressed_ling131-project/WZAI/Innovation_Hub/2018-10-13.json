I'm Talking with Robert supposed to be a professor of biology and neurology at Stanford he's the author of the have the biology of humans at our best and worst [noise]\nSo we've talked about culture we've talked about genetic if both of those have tremendous power very often beyond your control you you don't\nChange the culture you're you grow up in usually you obviously cannot control your genetics what does that say to you about free well and our ability to shape our own lives\nWell if you spend enough time looking at how we are shaped by everything from\nThe subliminal sensory stimulus ten seconds ago to\nWhy humans evolved a way they are rather than being ... everything in between you spend enough time with that and you know that concept of free will start seeming mighty suspect ... one can argue till the cows come home with certain branches of philosophers\nBut in terms of that I come out as which turned hard determinist I don't think there's a shredder free will help there um I think free will his what we call the biology that hasn't been uncovered yet\nAnd when you look at the history of our knowledge about what biology has to do with behavior\nWe've spent the last couple of centuries or so over and over repeating the same phrase which is why I had no idea that sort of biology had anything to do with it\n... I had no idea that an epileptic seizure is a disease rather than someone who's been consulting with Satan mhm oh I had no idea circa Nineteen fifties that a child has a lot of trouble learning to read rather than being lazy and an motivated has the\nCall a learning disability and when you look at the sheer percentage of what we know about the biological shaping our behavior [noise]\nNinety five percent of it was discovered in the last half century Ninety percent of in the last twenty five years eighty five percent since you woke up this morning and all that has been happening is this endless march of oh\nI had no idea of biology had to do with that and it is already convinced is than some of our most fundamental areas\nAnd at the end of the day either you could conclude there's no free will whatsoever and that's my spouse or at least you're going to have to admit there's a lot less free will than there used to be\nIn sort of western thinking in western values and judgments\nAnd it's getting squeezed into all sorts of really uninteresting places and that's just gonna keep happening and maybe down the line if you want to insist it was free will while you've lost your upper teeth this morning instead of your lower ones go for it be happy but\nI think by all launch it again this notion free will is just the biology we haven't discovered yet [noise]\nDoes that mean you must think that all the time in your own life you know am I really think it'd be interesting primates are if they do that again and I really choosing not to eat that cookie or that already kind of baked into like who I mean do you think that all the time in your own life\nWill that's the problem um you know mid again I'm totally intellectually comfortable with the notion that there is no free will watch or wherever it some ... we are nothing more or less than our biology at the same time I haven't remotest idea\nHow you're supposed to live a few actually started believing that to me there's obvious things to do which is completely revamp\nHow we do criminal justice and education and all sorts of other things like that but at the end of the day like you know without question I showed that I'm a total hypocrite and there's not really in court\n[laughter] because like\nIf I give a lecture and somebody comes up afterward and says oh good lecture I'll say thanks also when I'm supposed to say no actually it's this amount to how my having adequate protein levels as fetus and and this and this is my called\nRight yeah yeah\nI'm a certain level if it's good to be hard for us to accept that there is no free will when it comes to judging them and they're awful behaviors I'm going to be that much harder to acceptance absolutely justice applicable when it comes to us than our laudable once\nI Want to go back to something that you just mentioned the criminal justice system so believing what you do how do you think about this and that's all about choices people make and then tell other people obviously choose to punish them or not punish them uh\nFor for what they did well not not to sound like too much of a hot here as if I haven't already but\nLet's see just to sort of stayed at subtly the criminal justice system makes no sense whatsoever there's there's no souls there's no evil\nThere's no there's no punishment that in and of itself I mean none of this stuff makes sense that the criminal justice system runs on neurobiology that's close to two hundred years old literally in what's called ... ruling the difference between ... of knowing between right and wrong\nAnd other than that for the most part is ignored the last two hundred years of behavioral science twenty five percent of the men on death row in this country has a history of can cause of head trauma to their frontal cortex\nAnd when you damage the frontal cortex\nUs somebody who knows the difference between right and wrong and they still can't regulate their behavior and when they do something appalling at that point invoking evil it makes much sense as invoking the notion of even when a car who's breaks the failed hit somebody ...\nAn in both cases you don't leave them out on the street being dangerous but when you put a car in the garage because he can't fix the brakes and dangerous you don't sit there and say justice has been served\nAnd this car is not going to get to drive around in the countryside anymore on a sunny day is just\nA mechanical problem and in a horribly simplified way we're biological machines and if it's ... to turn this into machines and that way it's a hell of a lot better than demonizing us into having rotten souls when we may just have something screw with one or transmitted system\nIn some ways at the argument that you make really affects huge swaths of our culture it seems to me like I think about the entire section of a book store right that's designed to help\nThat you know books to help you find that to help you succeed at work books doubt you do well in school I can make friends better and but there is no need for that section if it's pre determined whether you're going to succeed at work or you're going to make friends or you're not\nWill but nonetheless you've got to incorporate the fact in there that behavior changes yeah\nAnd it's not determine a stick in the sense that like a puritan neurobiologist would have set a Plymouth Rock or something right right but it's instead in a much more interesting hopeful way for example\nI'm conventional language that we would use you sit there and you hear about the story of Hugh Thompson and you come out of their inspired inspired\nShe did something amazing inspired\nThere was nothing extraordinary about his upbringing\nInspired five minutes before that he was no more amazing when you were me put his pants on one leg at a time it's after a while maybe I could be more like Hugh Thompson ... so we've just given sort of an English description of what it is to be inspired by somebody\nWhat does that neural biologically the fact that a human can do what she did\nAnd the fact that you just heard about it\nMight very well change something in your ... and two and a half more neurons then we're working this way this morning are now involved in a sense of advocacy ... and doing the right thing when it's the terrifying thing to do\nWhen you were inspired when you're demoralized when you're deflated when you're bored by something those are as biological phenomena as anything else and they leave their traces so the fact that\nUm men in the early Nineteen hundreds who owned an amusement park and he actually use the power that corporations had gained a to protect his own civil rights ah so the man who own the amusement park\nOr with African American and he was sued by folks in Virginia who were saying and this and we don't want all these African Americans coming into our neighborhood to go to this amusement park and the owner was actually able to defend himself because corporations had such extensive rights I Do want to talk about that case\n[noise] sure it was a case involving like you say an amusement park for African Americans in Virginia back at around the turn of the century and the local neighbors sued or trying to put the amusement park out of business\nBecause they said on the African Americans were not allowed to buy the land that the amusement park was located on okay\nWas that in the law that ... are not allowed to buy that land\nWas not the law so that African Americans could bought a land it was there were restrictions in the deed of the land okay that you could not be sold to African Americans okay okay um this was a racially restrictive covenant a common place way in which racial segregation was enforced in America and the Jim Crow era\nAnd the court nonetheless ruled in favor\nThe park was not owned by African Americans was owned by a corporation corporation may have been run by African Americans but the corporation had no race itself the court said I'm\nA and a really highlights an interesting an unexpected phenomenon I found in looking at the history of corporate rights is that in many ways it the rights of corporations became tied up with questions of race slavery and civil rights just like almost anything else in American history\nTo go back to Mitt Romney that that famous quote you know corporations are people couldn't you argue and I I guess corporations' probably has that you know look corporations are a collection of people and\nUm their interests you know when they fight for their interests whether it's talking about terrorists or whatever it is they are fighting to keep their workforce to not have to lay people off to be profitable to share those profits um\nIsn't that in some you know I think ... you know people derided Mitt Romney but isn't that\nA reasonable way to look at things that corporations are a collection of people and they're trying to act in their best interest\nThat is exactly the way the Supreme Court has tended to view corporations over the course of American history the for all the controversy over corporate personhood\nCitizens United never relies on that idea at all and in fact what I find in my book is that\nIf you look at the history of Supreme Court cases extending rights to corporations\nWe find that most of those cases the Supreme Court rejects the idea of corporate personhood and says instead the corporations are associations of people suit and that people come together in the corporate form and they shouldn't lose their rights when they do so but there are some interesting questions about who really belongs to the corporation\nWhen Hobby Lobby refuses to provide birth control as required under federal law and health care plans for employees\nUm that's you know ten thousand female employees who are adversely affected by that there isn't a that is made by a to pursue the interests of the four or five owners of the Hobby Lobby company um whose interest really should be a recognized the the people who contribute the money or the people who contribute the labor and everything else\nCan you imagine a whole bunch more cases coming down the pike like as more CEOs get active and get involved um I think a bank of America that just a few months ago said they don't want to finance companies that that make a weapons like the air Fifteen ah we've seen Patagonia sue the Trump\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a

brought against conflict mineral disclosures under the securities laws and and do you buy one study a full fifty percent of all First Amendment cases brought today are brought by corporations and
