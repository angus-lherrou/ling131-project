ten what she was only six team and the poster came out with an advertisement for flower tease her baking which seems like just about the most innocuous thing in the world\nWasn't here was Nineteen oh two and ... Robertson saw horrified her she saw herself heat picture she had posts four and a photography studio which the flower manufacturer Franklin meals had somehow gotten a hold of\nThe keys over whether the company was entitled to this private picture of her ended up in court\nHurt suit begins at kind of whole chain of cases in state courts around the use of one's image without lens permission\nSarah I go an associate professor of history at Vanderbilt University and she says today's worries about privacy\nThere were a rash of technologies in the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds that make people feel like privacy was being stolen from them technologies like photography particularly instant photography and mass media and if you can believe it postcards\nWhen postcards came on board of course anyone could read the back of a postcard from the mail carrier to a nosy neighbor and so there's this you know small but I think very interesting and telling ... around the etiquette of postcard writing that people shouldn't be selling their secrets um these cards\nThe rise of telephones also seemed to many in the public like a serious violation of privacy\nTelephone operators wire tappers of various sorts party lines in um domestic telephone communications all of these men that people were communicating with each other about private matters but that a whole bunch of people could potentially at any point\nBe listening in on the same was true for the telegraph in terms of communications over telegraph cables both a government and criminals or various sorts it was well known could could tap into those communications\nSarah I goes new book is the known citizen a history of privacy in modern America\nAnd she argues that the story of privacy isn't linear we didn't have a whole bunch of privacy and some previous era that we continue to lose piece by piece what we want to but we demand what we hope for\nHe keeps changing which brings us back to Abigail Robertson the girl who was shocked to see herself on the flower poster\nRobertson one her case in court but when she got to the state level on appeal she lost her last enraged the public\nThe chief judge Bolton Parker said there was no quote so called writer privacy\nParker was pilloried but he went on to run for president against Theodore Roosevelt and if you've never heard of ... and Parker well you know what happened in that election\nThe U.S meanwhile kept grappling with new inventions and ideas that required often compromises in our privacy\nSocial Security numbers were one of those that that I think Americans really weighed and made a trade off about that this number which did allow the government to track ones earnings and\nOr even something simple like their telephone number so I think the shift that we're seeing is a kind of protection around pieces of information that might\nBe aggregated to harm us in some way versus I'm a kind of\nDeveloping openness rate in revealing who we really are and not having shame about that right so stigmas are falling away yet private data is becoming more valuable uh so those those are different pieces of privacy but they're moving in different directions\nSo fast forwarding a little bit um how do you think the rise of the Internet has affected privacy both kind of real privacy and then like our perception of the privacy that we have\nUm so the Internet is a huge topic for privacy of course I'm One of the things the Internet did was make opting out more difficult of ...\nW ... members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming so standing member visit Cape and islands dot org\nActually that really reversed a tradition where it was actually hard to get information it was hard to get information out and to circulate it it it flip flop that so that that was a hugely important part of the Internet and the way that it's intersected with privacy debates and also of course gave Americans who have long um many long wanted an audience of some kind right and\nA kind of influence and reach exactly that gave them a platform for their blog for their\nThoughts for you know sharing their photographs of their meals [laughter]\nYou know giving allowing their friends to see their movements it allowed people to do what they've been doing since the days of the postcard which is you know share information about themselves and and so those those two facets um again have come together and really powerful ways in the\nUh ability of now many many many people to look into and use that information in ways that we are not always intended of course by the people who put it out there to begin with\nLet me just take a step out of history here for a minute ... will step back into it for a minute but I think in some ways people think of like history is a story of privacy being off straight you know you lost some with the with uh the telephone people can listen in to calls and the telegraph and then the Internet\nAnd you know and closed circuit TV cameras all of our city than you just keep going and people know more and more about you\nBut in some sense if I if you think back to like medieval in London or something people living very close together walls being not very thick you can just hear what people are saying on the other side you know or people in living in very small villages in small communities where everybody knows everybody and everybody knows everybody's business\nIn some ways like tomorrow if I Walk through Rio or Beijing or like New York city\nBut he would know who I was I mean I can walk through anonymously and maybe privately I mean in some ways I feel like you could argue that we maybe have more privacy than we had hundreds of years ago [noise]\nAbsolutely I think this is what has missed often in our contemporary debates this idea that the privacy of some things on quantity that was there once [laughter] and is now gone and or eroding\nSlipping for our fingers but no it's true that we live privately more privately in many ways than did people a couple of centuries ago in terms of a White House construction ways that neighborhood they're designed homes\nWrites in our sensibilities sense of what should be private um has changed and so it I think it's really a mistake to think about privacy is all moving in one direction um this is what makes it hard to chart and hard to kind of place in any given point but it's it's the exact and in certain ways even though perhaps\nWe have less privacy in our communications today or around our personal information say um it's accessibility to others we have more privacy I think some ways in ways we live in a way we think about ourselves as private up people who are not to have the state or neighbors peering in through our windows all\nThe time [noise] so what's your diagnosis of where we are now are we like a lot less private than we were a hundred years ago\n[noise] I don't think so but I Do think that the substance of our\nPrivacy in our ideas about privacy rights or have changed and changed in conjunction with all kinds of things technological developments date developments a commercial or and so on architectural even I think if I were to describe our current moment I think what we're experiencing are\nTwo different trajectory is coming together and have created a lot of problems I'm One of them\nIs the ability for many different agencies to know us very well um by matching emerging technologies\nThe other is this a impetus that many citizens have had since the Nineteen seventies to disclose more of their authentic selves on different kinds of media platforms those are coming together in ways that are I think um we're unanticipated and which have meant that there is a ton of information out there about us\nSome of it uh kept by record keepers some of it disclosed voluntarily by us um and and then we've got we're in this technological and commercial moment where all of that is valuable to others\nAnd there are many many ways to harness it so those two things have come together they didn't they didn't necessarily have to come together but they have and I think that explains are a scandal late in the\nMoment you know firm Equifax to Cambridge Analytica and whatever is next to\nSara I go is the author of the known citizen history of privacy in modern America she's also an associate professor of history at Vanderbilt Sarah thank you very much thanks for the conversation I enjoyed

grassroots organizational prowess of the n._r._a. from P.

innovation hubs I'm Karen\nSixty cigarettes where you get good parents most of them are on kids doctors smoke them around ... you could barely turn on the TV without seeing someone with a cigarette in their hand\nPart of the rat pack was no exception here he is doing a spot for Newport cigarettes during his show on NBC\nFalse listen to this new for commercial I just wrote or expect you to write jokes on commercials listen to this new port refreshes while you're smokes because only Newport combines mental find tobacco's and the entertainment full that I've always thought about Newport\nAnd cigarettes they popular over the next few decades\nBut then something happened cigarette prices started to rise health awareness campaign started popping up all over the country little by little cigarette smoking ... a few decades ago more than fifty percent of American men smoked now five and six don't\nSo what does it take for a social movement to face down something as big as the cigarette industry and what does that success tell us about other movements\nThe tobacco control side has been so successful against the tobacco industry because they realize that the enemy here is not you know just Philip Morris or Salem or any of the cigarettes it's the brands that says these iconic images of the Marlborough man is Joe Camel\nThat's mostly crutch field executive director of Georgetown University's global social enterprise initiative she has spent years studying why certain movements achieved our objectives like the fight for gay marriage that campaign to expand gun rights and white others\nSo let's talk about social movements that using as you kind of look forward here might be strengthening in their power out we talked a little bit about gun control advocates in that vein is there anything else that strikes you\nI think about a lot about the me too movement with all that's going on in the headlines these days\nAnd certainly from a grassroots perspective as you have more women coming out and just exposing themselves to the scrutiny and the hatred that they often are up against on the side of transparency and saying this happened to him and there's a lot of strength in numbers\nYou know what's interesting about me too is that the challenges around gender equality sexual harassment sexual assault there isn't a policy or a law that can necessarily change things at this point if you think about it and most workplaces except for a few exceptions\nYou know sexual harassment sexual abuse is illegal right what you need to do is change social norms so if you think about one of the successful movements we studied in her book the anti drunk driving movement led by mad mothers against drunk driving you know there is no policy or law\nThat says you have to have a designated driver\nBut because mad both tried to enforce existing laws they also put forth a campaign around friends don't let friends drive drunk and that was actually invented by a group in Canada but mad had the chance\nMake that go viral you know decades before we had Internet and things that go instantly viral and it became the norm that if you're at a party and you see your friends had one too many you don't let them back drunk you take their kids designated driver\nThat the social norm shift to behavior change so when you look at me too I think a lot of this is incumbent upon men in positions of power who are the ones that can enforce their peers\nTo not engage in abusive um types of behaviors that movement thinking about what how do we actually shift the norm becomes\nApparent and then there's you know other things you can do as well like continuing to advocate and push for nondiscrimination laws having more women in positions of leadership and power\nIs the number one way to prevent these types of things from happening as well and you still have vast inequalities at that level [noise]\nMostly ... is the executive director at Georgetown University's global social enterprise initiative she's also the author of the book how change happens way some social movements succeed while others don't asleep thank you very much thank you for having me\nBy the way a while back we talked ... about how effective modern protest actually are\nIs a conversation that challenged some of my assumption will have a link to it on our Facebook page Facebook dot com flush
