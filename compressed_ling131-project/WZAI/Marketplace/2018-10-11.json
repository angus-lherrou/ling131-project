{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WZAI", "content": "You came into the studio today ...\nThank you for having me like uh most of the people who are going to hear this my guess would be and probably most of the people who know you now ... as the guy that you are a no you from from TV and the Tonight Show yeah even though you've met a ... you know I've had\nThis one year's meant hey you never know I mean George Foreman a helps your sandwich\n[laughter] at all things before the ... no\nNo new um I knew early I was going to be all things to all people at least people were getting spot on now you know previously I was you're the kind of germs which Jay Z right or yeah or even to this day it's like\nOh you're Jimmy Kimmel drummer right [laughter]\nOr even worse than we finally get your gym do you think\nI'm the first there was a little it throws you off a little bit you know people have history like uh\nNowhere but um do you are and what to do you ever look around and say I'm a kid from Philadelphia man what am I doing more [noise] more or less a it's how did I get here often when I go back to Philadelphia I'd do something called chasing ghosts\nAre still in my first car and I keep it up I'm Sorry you still have your first car accident and I still ... yeah and I go to my mom's house and I get it and usually I drive around\nWhen I go to Philly all drive from like midnight till three in the morning literally just chasing ghosts and the thing I always do is when I go past\nThe place where the roots used to a mosque on um\nFit than south street there I'm always like yell like back in Nineteen Ninety two I thought Nineteen Ninety nine was going to be the future you know yeah let alone\nWhat I still be a thing in two thousand Eighteen I mean I'm not one of those knock on wood people that I don't want to jinx it but as he knocks on what I as I as I did it you know apathetic ally but I I just I'm Amazed that no one's kicked me out the pool yet yeah we we had\nUm we had ... on the program in about two weeks ago and when the whole thing about she got limited what radical during you know and she's doing really well and I said how are you made now and she said oh honey you're never made\nUm yeah and even you know this is our our technically are twenty seven professional year as a group\nAnd I I still work as if this could all end tomorrow that's why people ask like well you do so many things you have a Nineteen jobs like when did you get the relax and you just don't in my mind it's it's always this could end tomorrow so don't ever sleep\nYou know it does it ever surprise you that you have become that guy now to people turn to for advice and mentorship and\nI'm I'm very uncomfortable with that even my Twitter handles says like I'm I'm Better as a student I had a teacher like\nThis whole course love is said scholar at ... earlier I your bunch of rappers called me like oh gee [laughter] no I I I kinda shrug it that ... would you be\nHere without the Tonight Show I mean you you have said that you looked at it that tonight tribute as a as a way to sort of fade into the sunset\nOn um resilient so I Would like to think that I've always been something but I Would be a fool if I didn't tell you that\nIn a way more doors than I expected like I I truly thought this was going to be the most gentle mercy killing however [noise]\nNo I I did I [laughter] I'm just glad I'm not I'm not one that I think like oh this could benefit you you know because I was reading on the op eds and even though I Love being underestimated huh someone someone had a wrote in a I'm In a block once like\nLike oh this is a sad day for music because watching the roots except this Tonight Show gig will be like watching Miles Davis bus going to New York ...\nI was actually like good luck with what I Want I Want to be underestimated 'cause I wanted to I Want it to to kill all a perceptions of just being a square gig do do you buy the sort of the the commission was intimate you've changed late night music\n[noise] um [noise]\nI mean there are small nuances but uh I think just the times have changed I think we just got very lucky with the timing the Internet and social media\nHad just started to become a thing something like ... the idea of viral videos was becoming a thing\nAnd we took advantage of it like we were really young kid on the block and it was clear like Letterman wasn't going to start you know ... and that sort of thing so we just took advantage of and then the playing field you know a lot of late night shows were just post jazz music\nThere there were other avenues to explore and we took full advantage of it yeah it's it's interesting because there is a lineage right there's ... from the old Tonight Show and then there's Paul Shaffer probably the next notable down in an interview\nAnd the roots that's where it and you know again like I didn't you know I didn't have posters of ... and said I Want to like one day that'll be me is just making them most of it again like in two thousand eight when he proposed that to us so\nWe should say you you didn't take the call for a long time yeah I I was like a man we just got to to a place where we are making good money on the road like why will return\nBack on Seventeen years of climbing the mountain to start all over again and I'm you know the one thing is that where we were failing miserably or was that our domestic personalized huh kids were getting older crime more at the airport\nSo it was sort of like we weren't actively asking for it but it was like man if there's\nWay into a position that I use all this stuff is birds right there Celine Dion our way into a position where we could still make a good living without having to\nHave lobby caught for him and be on the bus for nine hours and that's where I Am in this fell into our lap and it was like be careful what you ask for there's a\n... this is going to get old marketplace in and you know ... management on your here but I Lived for that's what we'll good and in fact that's the really the question right because you have said more than a couple of points\nPlanning something is the joy of actually doing that something and the question that the out of the question that comes out of it is what's it like to work for you how do you run the ban how you run the how do you run you guys on the show\nUm you know there's there's lessons to be learned about it because again where we're at a phase in our lives where we're not twenty two\nTwenty three by the bureau what forty five now yeah I Wish I was okay for at least ...\nI'm Sorry I'm so the things that I Would like to do like you know relentless rehearsals for seven hours in a row in that sort of thing and we used to do\nYou know you got to kind of be considered the fact that it might be soccer night or you know that's sort of thing not to mention a lot of our side projects\nWell it's weird because one the roots is just one of Nineteen things I'm responsible for when we're in a very sweet spot right now where we're actually having more fun with each other\nSocially which is great that we've ever had I realize that we're going to fall apart if as people we weren't having fun with each other you know what I mean so I think now that we're in as as a unit [noise] this is the best it's ever been\nWorking at it right there
