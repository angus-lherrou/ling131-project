marketplace [noise]\nIs going to sound a little cynical and I suppose in a way it is but that doesn't make it not true kids and I'm Talking really young kids who are or a market there a market that can be catered to the content can be created for and from which profit can be made\nThe corporate example at hand is YouTube and its influence on the youngest of consumers Alexis Madrigal is a staff writer for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised it by ... to walk on the program thanks for having show talked about how you came to work on this story\nThat scene toddler YouTube and I was like\nWhat are all these things all these brands I'd never heard of these companies all over the world and I watch my daughter becoming totally absorbed\nIn this kind of animation that to me looks kind of pre Pixar you know what I mean\nHuh okay there's lots to unpack in there because the idea first of all of a toddler you to what what is that is it as it sounds\nSo Derrick channels on YouTube that are built specifically for you know when you're old ... year old three year old is and that's what I call tons of YouTube and it's this kind of like wild place well [laughter]\nI I almost don't even know what to say uh the premise here is that is that really young kids in this economy have tablets and phones and they're on them off almost as much as adults that kind of see\nWho I mean YouTube is by far the most popular brand among children and even little children have their own favorites for one of the biggest brands within the space has called to chew TV\nThey have Nineteen billion viewed as they have twenty nine million subscribers this is a global children's entertainment ... kids love it they can't get enough they watch them over and over and over and over\nAll right so maybe I'm being naive here but I'm a you know back with the the analogy you make in this piece is to PBS in public broadcasting in Sesame Street in children's television workshop from like fifty years ago now in in the American economy\nAnd the ostensible reason for all of that was to educate not necessarily want a two year olds but\nYou know slightly older toddlers and and give them a leg up is that\nThe mission of of toddler YouTube and and true true TV is that what they're doing\nYou know I think right now they're in a transitional place they've banned entertainment they've been just trying to capture as much children's attention as they possibly can and now they realized that they've done that and they need to\nDeliver them something better and so what I'm hoping is that this global phenomenon of all these video producer it's on YouTube will have a similar revelation and do similar work to create YouTube it's good for kids rather than just something that sucks up their time\nWell so spit bullet for me do you think that's gonna work because you know not to make the American analogy on everything here but there were researchers and educators and and government regulators in some sense talking to the folks who are doing children's television workshop is there a sense that there's that infrastructure beneath what toddler YouTube's do not really on the other hand\nYears of research on children's television but the media environment the media business there's obviously a much different\nAnd the biggest difference is there's just you to basically dishes where kids are going this is where the whole businesses and say YouTube itself would have to be the one that sort of maybe tip the scales for educational content within the algorithms\nThat determine what people watch what do we know what do we think uh it's actually doing it the kid setting aside for a minute whatever educational benefit they might have we know what being attached to our phones and our screens does to grownups\nWhat about the kids young kids well I think you know they're the worst possible impact is that essentially that kind of attention grabbing fast paced content and the ability to switch between those things very quickly maybe sending kids have to expect a kind of pacing that's actually not educational\nAnd that's kind of the big worry that we sort of been juice kind of attention a loss and kids\nAlexis Madrigal he writes for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised by you asked me what you want to show [noise]\n\n\n\nComing up a huge part of the music
