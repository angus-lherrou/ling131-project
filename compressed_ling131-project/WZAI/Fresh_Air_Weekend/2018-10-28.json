Terry Gross back with Melissa McCarthy she co starred in bridesmaids start in the heat and now stars in the new film can you ever forgive me as a biographer turned literary forgery it's based on a

know no I don't know why are you not [laughter] but\nBut the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and love le mans teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal and the other couple the Leslie manpower ... couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash than he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do hear them say All right you know to know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with

cornered rat you corner me I Will chew through you know she was ...\nAnd then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty it's just you kind of improving insults in that scene in it and it just goes on and on with more over the top insult is that something that you're famous for outside like in the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not oh go around insulting people I Hope ever\nBut the first time I watch that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] I never say that and the first time a sitting with with that said we're watching you say it you said all of it and I\nI didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came off the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory\n[noise] Melissa McCarthy at what point did you start thinking about either acting or comedy which came first like acting or comedy comedy standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of suddenly and\nI moved to New York when I was twenty kind of out of the blue or had been living in Boulder, Colorado I'm not sure exactly what I was doing or why it was even there I moved there with my sister and then just was still kind of lingering\nAnd ah had a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder and I said I don't know I only want to be in New York so three days later I moved to New York city\nAnd our first night he said you should do your you're going to do an open Mike night tomorrow night and I said All right I went up on stage the second night I was in New York and\nI kinda thought oh I think this is what I'm going to do and I remember calling my parents saying I'm not going to go back to school\nI had planned on finishing up at FIT I hadn't finished school this the fashion I went to yes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but I Love making clothes I loved\nWatching other designers studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching\nAnd then they did stand up one night and I just thought I think I'm gonna go this direction\nSo um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there when you went in\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nAnd like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly show them that not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to Hitler God I don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not\nHow was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road if like can I get a show of hands for women who is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself because you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feel is that like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAnd they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and sang times oh my God I saw the light oh\nEver present uh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't know what the light man\nI Would have flashes like ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know the stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal\nSenator who's ever running the night is also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four and ... other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up people actually laughed at something much to my surprise and as they left he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up\nIt was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me\nHe's really encouraging me and then I finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good rules because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know I Want to be a part of\nMaking these three dimensional flawed often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read were kind of\n\n\n\nMm [noise]\nMm [noise]\nMm [noise]\n\n\nOh\n\nThis is fresh air weekend I'm Terry Gross my guest Paul day now is probably best known for his performance in there will be\nLocal preacher imagine being in your early twenties and working on that film with director Paul Thomas Anderson an actor Daniel Day Lewis\nThey know it was only twelve when he had a part in the Broadway revival of inherit the wind starring George the Scott\nDino also co starred in the films Little Miss sunshine twelve years a slave and portrayed Brian Wilson in the film love and mercy\nNow the age of thirty four he directed his first film called wildlife the screenplay which dino co wrote with his partners away 'cause then is adapted from a Richard Ford novel of the same name\nWild life is about a fourteen year old boy Joe who was recently moved with his parents to a small town in Montana he hasn't yet made friends and he's looking to his parents for a sense of home and stability\nBut his father played by Jake Gyllenhaal loses his job and his sense of purpose the mother played by Carey Mulligan takes a part time job to help make ends meet\nMeanwhile it's wildfire season and the father decides to joined the men fighting fire which leaves his wife and son to fend for themselves during the in determinant period he'll be gone\nAnd that changes everything just this virus can get out of control soak in people's lives here's a scene in which Joe comes home from school to find his father breaking the news to his mother that he's leaving them to fight the wildfires sorry\nI'm late [noise] talk to your father tell them not to act like a fool nappy finish\nI put my name on a list I waited for my chairs and all the fundamental point is for me\nYou don't know anything about fires that burned up ... I've been reading about them I don't know reading about the study were Johnny gene whatsoever father leaving us go fight wildfires\nWhy why\nAre you what the grocery store we'll go out with a bunch of that faith risk I tell\nPeople what isn't right\nFor what does it pay\n[noise]\nDollar an hour [noise]\nYou do what I Will be a law against you can do is no housing no [laughter] I don't know [laughter] we\nWent on to the problem [noise]\nMaking this film and welcome to fresh air so that this film is adapted from a Richard Ford novel that like your movie is called wildlife how did you first find novel and why did you fall in love with that [noise]\nUm I was a fan of Richard forwards I had just read a book called Rock Springs which is a beautiful collection of short stories and I went to the bookstore in Brooklyn called book court which is which is now closed looking for any other book of his opened up wildlife and honestly from the first sentence\nOr even the first paragraph remains probably one of my favorite in any book ever so I was sort of immediately in just as a reader I mean not not I'm going to make a film but while this book is for me\nWould you read the first paragraph from the novel which we happened to have sitting on the table here\nOr [noise] in the fall of Nineteen sixty when I was sixteen and my father was for a time not working my mother met a man named Warren Miller and fell in love with him\nThis was in great falls Montana the time of the gypsy base in oil boom and my father and brought us there in the spring of that you're from Lewiston, Idaho and the belief that people small people like him are making money in Montana or soon would be and he wanted a piece of that good luck before all of it collapsed and was gone and the wind\nThank you [laughter] I mean the language it's just a high out of the richer for our family before yes I yes I agree [noise] so tell us more about what you related to in the story of this is the writing which is beautiful yeah but you were adapting the story so what was it about the story that we're\nSo even about twenty pages into the book there's a paragraph about a um kid watching his mom teach swim class and thinking that everybody around her thinks oh there's a woman with a good smile or there's a woman with a good figure there's one is happy and he knew something was wrong it home\nAnd at that point my heart sort of left and I was like wow this is as great writing can do or a great song or whatever it is it felt like it's for you in some way and that\nI just remember I moved to a new town when I was fourteen your home is sort of the edge of the world when you move somewhere new ... because you don't know what's outside of it you don't have friends yet\nYou know school is not yet a release um it's sort of scary to go there for the first time and so we grew up in a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan\nI'm really close with my family maybe too close and I remember when my parents started having you know struggles in that relationship sort of what a profound and I guess\nLook sort of reflected back to me how family is one of the greatest loves in our life and because of that it's also sometimes one of the greatest sources struggle in our life and he was able to capture that with compassion\nIn the clip that we just heard the parents are fighting and one of them says to the teenage boy what do you think Joe how awkward is that ask game a teenage boy to weigh in on the battle between his parents were you in that position [noise]\nWell I think so and I think that's something that are related to in this character I think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about I'm a kid rebels writer or something from their youth that's for me\nI remember sort of standing in the middle feeling the ground shake and not wanting things to tip so Joe and I have something in common and and Richard Ford and I have something in common in that regard I was somebody who wanted to keep things together so if something like that had been posed to me\nUm you know I wouldn't have said\nUm you know out of here and like what are you know I Would have tried to actually understand what was going on and then it kind of help did your parents separate well my parents have an interesting situation which is they separated they like the end of this book strangely which is on the on the film ... living together a few years ago\nThey never got officially divorced but we do not always lived together [laughter]\nLet's talk about your acting and let's start with there will be blood you gave such an amazing performance and this year you're a teen evangelical preacher in a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century during the early days when they are discovering that there's oil there\nAnd there's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also an incredible capitalist you comes to town and wants to\nGet as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and have become antagonist and in one scene in Oregon here he's basically told by one landowner that he'll sign over the oil rights\nTo Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you and your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're baptize ing him and I should just say parenthetically that the Daniel Day Lewis character of earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father\nAnd then when the boy goes death as a result of another oil accident Daniel Day Lewis sends him away to school okay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and\nWe have a center with us here who wishes for salvation ... are you a question or\nOr ... you would you\nSay it to him go ahead\nAnd speak to him it's All right\nYes ... nice\n\nWhat do you want me to say [noise]\nYou come here and you wrote and goes and wealth but you have also brought your bad habits as a back slider\nYou lost did after women and you have a band in your child your child that you raise your the band and all because he was sick and usa and she'll say now I Am a sinner should say it loud I ever since I'm a student", "show_name":
