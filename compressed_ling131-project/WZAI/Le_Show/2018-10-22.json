an opportune time to welcome Dr killed me back to the show she's professor of public policy and economics at Stony Brook University in New York formerly professor of economics at the University of\nMissouri Kansas City she was she comes from the U.S Senate budget committee minority party staff that is the Democratic party stuff\nAnd a founder and editor in chief of the blog new economic perspective a doctor killed welcome back thank you so much for having me back [noise]\nLooks to do with a ... a little really limited stuff at the beginning I'm just so people don't feel left behind or or just so people don't start reading the left behind books what is macro economics so macro\nEconomics is the is the big picture stuff right as distinct from ... which focuses on things like individual consumer behavior or the behavior of individual firms macroeconomics tries to wrap its arms around\nThe entire economy and ask questions like what makes the economy behave the way it does why does are out to our GDP bound up and down and go see these things we called business cycles why do people sometimes get thrown out of jobs in large numbers and why does the economy go into recession and\nThere I it isn't clear how much more ah unemployment there is and the economy you know how how much closer we can get to something like you know genuine full employment without creating an inflation problem that I don't think we're there yet\nYou mentioned benefits I I get the impression from some stuff I read that one of the reasons employers won't employ more people fulltime than they do now is because they want for precisely the reason they want to avoid\nThe obligation to pay benefits is there any data to to\nIt's not only data to support that there's plenty of anecdotal evidence as well I mean in my\nPrevious post as a at the University of Missouri where I was chair of the economics departments I can remember um being cautioned by uh the dean and other administrators to be careful or chairs to be careful when\nA hiring adjunct professors and you know putting people over that threshold where the university would be on the hook for benefits and so it's just you know it's a\nA a feature of our disastrous health care policy and delivery system that you know you've you've incentivize employers to restrict the number of hours available so that they can avoid providing benefits\n[noise] no I'm not big on charts I I'm I'm I'm a text person as opposed to a truck person but as I read a him into material uh there's there's one chart that was sort of stands out as as particularly\nMemorable and made them mnemonic which is the the um I guess it is of comes out of the banking background of a one or more of of the people in them empty which is\nThe accounts have to balance that that are spending on one side of the balance sheet equals income on the other side of the balance sheet can you talk a little bit about the\nSure ah the chart you're referring to we usually refer to it as the sector financial balances chartered or the ... that's ... that's that's a catchy name for their roles oftentimes\nIt uh you know it's funny about this thing is you're right uh we used it we use in a in empty but a lot of other people use it like ... she's the chief economist at Goldman Sachs\nHas referred to that chart and these are his words the most important grass in the world you see how what is so important about this these three lines right how why why you're studying and understanding this thing so important and what I usually do when I you know speak to audiences and they introduced this chart\nAnd it is a mind bender it really does flip the perspective I Walk in and people have a certain understanding of the way government deficits work and by and large the audience thinks the government's budget\nUh ought not to being deficits that it would be better to eliminate deficits an even better if we could get the government's budget into surplus that's kinda the starting point for people\nAnd then they voted in again you're talking about the federal government 'cause it's very different for ... local gr good ... exactly for the federal government\nMost of these people so I Walk in and I put up this chart and I say okay\nLet's let's talk about this let's talk about what the government's deficit really is and and you know I started at basically zero with them and they say what is it government deficit really mean what it means is that the government is putting more money into the economy than it's taking back out pay so if it spends a hundred in\nBut it only taxes Ninety back out we label that the deficit\nAnd everybody gets all you know their hackles\nUp because the government's budget is in deficit but it's like walking through life with one eye open and the other I closed you gotta open both eyes so that you can see both sides of the ledger it's these are accounting identities as you said everything has to ... to zero where everything has to balance so if the government's budget\nEnds up in deficits with ten somebody else's budget ends up in a surplus\nWith ten and that's what this sector balance Graff does it bring that into that ...\nAnd so people are able to see effectively that the government's red ink is our black ink and so I can walk them through history through the fifties and sixties and seventies and and that period in the late seventies early eighties when the\nWhen the trade balance goes from deficit interest of from surplus into deficit when the U.S begins running trade deficits and all that and I walk them through the whole thing and then we get to the Clinton years and we stopped\nAnd I say okay here we are Bill Clinton is president Nineteen Ninety eight Ninety nine two thousand two thousand and one for years running\nThe government's budget federal government's budget is in surplus now we're supposed to celebrate this right this is a great achievement fine fiscal responsibility and\nThen I show them that the consequence of having the federal government's budget move into surplus is that the budget for the rest of the economy the private sector moved deeply into deficit at that time and they can see it All right there before their eyes and suddenly\nThey're not so excited about the prospect of having the government's budget in surplus or even in balance they suddenly gain a new appreciation for government deficits because they can see that they're in fact the source of the surplus to the rest of the economy\n[noise] it it strikes me that I'm old enough to have seen a lot of different administrations come and go sadly I'm no much fortunately that um\nRepublican or Democrat very often seems to be more hawkish about deficits than they can party a that the party for a various reasons\nUm differing between the two parties but the the the in party always likes to spend money more than a dozen\nAnd that the out party always likes to uh Hector it for a creating deficit so that now the Democrats are the deficit hawks the Republicans make these tax cuts they make the spouse or a very big defense budget increase\nAnd uh you know do worry about it don't worry about it ... it'll take care of itself\nIt's almost well I guess it's really supply side economics again but you know the growth and the economy from the tax cuts will pay for the tax cuts and even more have we ever seen that are actually ... the the\n... and data\nOh I Know but you know what you it might be possible how that works that way it's just that they keep constructing their tax cuts in the worst possible way which is to say\nAlmost all of the benefits go to the people who are least likely to turn around and spend the windfall back into the economy so eighty three eighty four percent of all of the benefits from the recent one point five trillion Republican tax\nCut virtually all of the benefits go to the top one percent overtime now\nIf you were really trying to have tax cuts do the supply side art Laffer curve trickle down thing pay for themselves and all that stuff and presumably you would construct tax cuts exactly the opposite way I Would make sure that yeah you make sure that the money goes to the people who are the most likely to turn around and spend virtually all of it back\nInto the economy might in fact create so much of a boom that tax revenue goes up\nAnd and you know the thing quote unquote pays for itself right\nAh I guess Republicans would say but the odds are part of the\nThe private economy to say\nYeah yeah there are I mean there are a great incentives for private jets and\nUh and so forth but I mean that's that is the private economy as well I mean it's not just grow you know it's no question so if something that windfall it's a very very wealthy take some of that tax break and and buy a new yacht somebody's got to build it somebody's going to be employed producing that yachts you get a few jobs added that but not the kind of\n... you know widespread job growth set the Republicans were touting when they talk\nTax cut and jobs bill so it really was supposed to be a lots and lots of a new job than that ... new jobs higher paying job that was the promise\nMellowed a uh last time we we spoke we talk mainly about the United states I Want to talk about to other countries uh which seemed to be a on point for this discussion one of which is the United kingdom a Theresa May at the recent conservative party conference of proudly announced that after ten years\nThe the a period of all of austerity\nIs over a austerity was the approach taken by almost all the countries in the European Union in response to the crash of two thousand eight and\nI as I recall I thought I think you and your college thought austerity was exactly the wrong approach to dealing with the crash\nWell yeah I mean like we were saying earlier the what you want the government's budget to do is is behave counter cyclical not pro cyclical and austerity\nIs pro cyclical policy it means at the exact same time that your economy is turning down because everyone it in the private sector's tightened their ... the government tightened its felt as well which is the same as just putting a noose on everyone and saying you know we're all going to jump to gather\nA it's precisely the wrong policy and not only that\nBy announcing as she just did that you know the era of austerity is over which she's really doing is just confirming that it was in Ireland voluntary it was gratuitous was never an out of economic necessity\nRight a budget that delivers the windfall to your constituencies that these are the people that I'm here to work on behalf of my donors the the well the big corporations and you use the budget process in a way that focuses not on what happens to the budget\nWhere the budget ends up but on you know how the budget can be used as a tool to benefit your constituents that's exactly what the Republicans have done very very good at it\nUm when my contrast that with when the Democrats were in a position to run the table or and or were in the middle of a financial crisis and uh some of the president's economic advisors were calling for a\nStimulus program of at least a trillion dollars I said a and a president thoughts of the bargain to down in order to\nTry to\nCompromise with Republicans who voted me to that point\nExactly right they were in a position to run the tables essentially Christina Romer a who was um very influential at the time in the Obama administration\nProfessor from UC Berkeley and I think she famously was pushing it gets come out that she was pushing for something closer to one point eight trillion dollars and you know you had Larry Summers and others also part of the ...\nW see a sustaining members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a so standing member visit Cape and islands dot org\nYou're right a President Obama went in and said basically will start at seven hundred and eighty or so billion and negotiate our way up\nAnd we know now that was done not direct tactic he should start up and expect to potentially negotiate your weight down and he was with himself he did he did he did and and remember that he you know it wasn't just a few months in office as the\nAs everything is falling apart and the deficit explodes because not because of anything Congress did but because the downturn was so severe and the economy was hemorrhaging jobs and so people losing their jobs\nYou know get a variety of um support mechanisms from the government you know food stamps and unemployment compensation and Medicaid a whole host of programs automatically kick in to support a weak economy and then meanwhile people become jobless their incomes collapse and federal tax receipts fall off the cliff to the deficit just\nBlows up all on its own and a President Obama goes on TV and he's asked about this explosion in the deficit and and you know the government trying to do something to prop up the economy and they say you know what at what point do we run out of money\nAnd I don't know if you remember his response but he said well we're out of money now and I thought oh no\nYou know that is a and that really boxes un because once you say essentially we've done all we can do you know we're out of money then that just allow the economy to languish for so many years without um the support of the support that it really needed because the fiscal authorities just\nKind of stepped away and said to the fed you know you guys got to do this because we're done\nI think you you are an and you and Alan Greenspan of both made the point that the federal government can run on the money right\nRight so that was not a useful comment a from President Obama at the time I remember my heart thinking I think the colored drained from me when I heard that\nUm because I knew what it meant I knew that it meant that we were not going to get the kind of a fiscal response that was going to be necessary to pull this economy out of you know the doldrums and that we were going to end up with a long protracted recession which is exactly what we got\nSo I Want to go back to your Senate experience for for one more question obviously as a staff member your main interaction\nBruce on your side of the aisle the legislators on your side avail but you also have a interaction with the staff members on the other side of the aisle as you try to uh put forward your understanding your micro economic understanding of this stuff what kind of response did you get from the staffers on the other side\n... [noise] I remember some conversations with I was the chief economist for the dens and I remember some conversations with the chief economist for the Republicans and he's found that we used to sit and have coffee sometimes and I remember that he found it fascinating I don't know how\nInventing a he found it and I don't know how much time you spent really thinking it through\nBut he did there was something about when I was saying that he was receptive to and I think maybe it's because I didn't sound like what he perceived to be that the typical Democrat that just you know wanted to spend more spend more\nThan I was also open to the possibility that tax cuts could be a useful thing especially where where we were at the time you know um and so\nUh I I remember that um but I to be honest I didn't interact a lot with staff on the other side it was I was mostly dealing with Democrats and their staffers\n... is is do you think that say and increased silo in effect a reflecting the increased partisanship of Congress or is that the way it's always been\nMy sense just when I arrived my sense is that it's um it's gotten worse but that it's been that way for some number of years some of the staffers that were on committee that you know when I arrived had been there for six years something like that and my sense was\nThat things were different but not much different\n[noise] [noise] and they're not getting better um well I'm Dr ... thank you so much for a\nReturn visit infer revisiting some of this material and for refreshing us on on how it's been going a year and in other places that I've asked you about and I'm\nA ... you're you're at a Stony Brook and do you still do a visiting lectures you were ...
