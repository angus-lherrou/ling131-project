calling for the first snow fall of the year but for the good people of buffalo that's not even caused where a long sleeve shirt\nWhen you live in Buffalo complaining about the weather is complaining about life itself I was picked up\nShe's been driving for twenty two years and our cat was filled with stuffed animals they line the dashboard hung from the rear view mirror and among the was attached to the steering wheel these are my co pilot she said some people have Jesus I have these guys\nShe goes by Charlie because her father was hoping she'd be a boy I really think the name made me a bit of a tomboy when I was younger they don't say tomboy anymore now everybody is filled with gender fluids I guess there was ahead of my time but anyway I'm all girl now\nAnd everyone still calls me Charlie after growing up in Buffalo she went to college down in Arizona because they want it to go to the hottest place I could find\nBut it turns out I'm not built for the desert seems more like a place for

midnight the kind of place that so tired that even the ceiling seems to be hunched over at the end of the bar\nThe bartender was a big bear of a man named Chris he had a giant beard and big pause and then grab while he worked he said that he's been in this bar for Thirty years and then he's been there so long he doesn't even smell they're famous buffalo wings any more\nPeople come in all the time and they say they smelled them all the way down the street but I don't smell thing who knows maybe it's me they smell\n\nEagerly place my water there's something great\nIn addition to whatever natural elements are involved the water the air the ingredients there's also a pride and love and as corny as it might sound the love the people ads makes all the difference\nHave you ever been away from home
