our fellow Americans\nThis week I was lucky enough to experience the iconic New York on them as I rolled into New York city there's something magical about fall in Manhattan It's that sweet spot between the summer humidity and the icy winter when you can actually walk around town\nFeel good and things don't smell so bad it was late afternoon when I checked into my hotel and dropped off my bags New York is a great walking city and nothing encourages that more than a hotel room the size of a pine cone [noise]\nThe streets were colorful is always and Halloween has hit the city have you ever complimented someone's costume and realized he was just a New Yorker wears a milk carton\nIs a hat [noise] I have [noise]\nWalked into Washington Square park and sat on a bench near a dog run there's nothing crazier than in New York dog park\nThese are not dogs that are used to the freedom of backyards and rolling hills these are patterns that have been locked indoors for hours drinking coffee trying not to pee on the New York post\nWhen they finally get to the dog park they lose their minds\nI sat next to one of the dog owners musician named Dave even though he was in sweat pants has long hair and cool Jean jacket said he was a rocker his dog look cool to he was a mutt named Rocco\nWith a spike collar and an upper lip than a permanence ...\nDavis lived in the village with Rocco his whole adult life and makes a living now is a studio musician he was lamenting about how the city has changed\nThere's no scene for the young bands anymore than New York used to be a city of artists weirdos who were too strange to live in their hometowns but now there's nothing left that the weirdos can afford\nHe said the one thing that will never change is the amazing diversity in the city there are people from all around the world he said just look at this dog park Rocco just a crazy mud and here he is hanging with three hugs a purebred German Shepherd and the French\nThis is New York\nAfter meeting some friends for dinner I headed back towards the hotel through the west village on a normal night this area's hopping but as Halloween comes near it's truly outrageous\nThe bars were in full force than people were dressed up in costumes roaming the streets to me it's the adults in costume were the scariest part of Halloween\nAt least one child dresses up like a ninja turtle chances are he won't be drunk and hitting on your girlfriend [noise]\nAnd they had a down McDougal street I was approached by what can only be described as a large dirty humor is facing smudge is had had a muddy footprint on it he was sweating and confuse\nThe grabbed my arm and asked if I knew where his friends where I felt bad for the summer but I had to laugh what kinds of friends was looking for where they ... do they live in a magical lamb should I Try and return them into his hollowed out tree\n[laughter] I felt bad for him so he took his big white hand in mine and walking down the street\nHave you ever gotten looks from strangers on the street and you knew without a doubt they thought you in the ... were lovers [noise]\nWe\nTried to reach racist steps and we saw a lot of people but no ... that's when he got desperate and decided to climb onto a mailbox for a better view the postal department might be slow they may not run their post offices that well but one thing they did right was designing their mailboxes\nThey created a square bottom that makes it seem as climbing it would be easy but when you get to that rounded top you quickly find out it's impossible to stand on\nEspecially if you're drunk desperate and dress like a blue cartoon character [noise] his effort\nWas valiant he wasn't falling off but he wasn't going up either he was clinging to the side frozen like a very koala there [noise] and I have never heard alive Kuala bear and couldn't tell you what kind of noise they made this one let out little half Yeltsin runs that broke my heart\nJust as I was about to help three others nerves came running up and grabbed his mom lost rather have them\nThat was blue and white for I felt as if I was responsible for this story book ending and I wandered away

their sliced outside\nI was worried about causing a scene by walking in with these murders but as soon as we entered I realize it was not going to be a problem it turns out that at midnight on friday before Halloween in the west village there are a lot of people in costume thinking the same thing\nThere was a sexy dabble a hotdog a Michael Jackson to clowns from it and one guy who looked like a sea captain who turned out not to be in costume at all [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI'm smiling and not as if I Know what he's talking about but the truth is I don't care [noise]\nUm you know watch my shabby
