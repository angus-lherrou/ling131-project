visit Cape and islands dot org\nIn this very divisive era as well as who governs key battleground states the results could be determined by who has the right to vote\nSince the twenty ten election over twenty states have adopted new restrictions on voting such a strict voter ID laws cutbacks to early voting and aggressive purging voters\nSince plenty fourteen hundreds of thousands of people were purged from the rolls in states that have a so called use it or lose it policy which removes people from the rolls if they haven't voted frequently enough\nIn Georgia alone that policy purged an estimated a hundred seven thousand voters according to a new investigation by American Public Media's investigative unit\nAnd twenty Thirteen the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the voting rights act\nBut current ballot initiatives in several states could make it easier in the future to register to vote in those states and to crack down on gerrymandering I guess Ari Berman has been covering developments in voting rights and voting restrictions he's the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America\nHe's a senior writer for Mother Jones reporting fellow of the nation Institute and there's also written about voting issues with the New York times magazine and Rolling Stone\nAri Berman welcome back to fresh air before we talk state by state and get into specifics is it a coincidence that there are voters being perjure asked for IDs ideas that many citizens don't have in several states\nIt's not a coincidence and let me just give you the big picture of what's happening with voting rights right now so since the twenty ten election twenty four states have implemented a new restrictions on voting so\nNearly half the states in the country have tightened their voting laws to do things like require strict forms of photo ID to cast a ballot or make it more difficult to register to vote or to cut back on early voting periods or to close polling places or to purge the voter rolls\nAnd many of these restrictions on voting are playing out now and the ... elections in critical states like Georgia North Dakota\nKansas et cetera where there are very close elections so is it a coincidence that all of this is happening [noise] it's not a coincidence\nBeen a major strategy within the Republican Party\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman he's author of the book give us the ballot modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones we'll talk more about voting rights after this short break this is fresh air\n\n[laughter]\n\nFresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman we're talking about voter rights and voter suppression he is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nNot just any secretary of State Kerry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state\nIn the country and he has really been the leader in the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission\nWhich was formed in a very high profile way and they shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data from all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year\nKobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this and the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case for restricting voting and what he's done\nIn Kansas is a few things he wrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act\nThat did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship\nTo register to vote meaning that you had to have a a passport or birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote this law blocked one in seven cans ... almost thirty five thousand people from registering to vote in that state the federal court actually struck that law down\nEarlier this year and said that there was\nAlmost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law\nThe votes that part of the law remains in effect that I've looked at the numbers in Kansas\nAnd over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed in Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id but Kobus only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one votes\nAnd now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly\nWho's a member of the state Senate and independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race in Kobach favor and the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter ID laws and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect reduce turnout by two percent\nIn that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted illegally and twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of those illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what is called that do to plant that idea\nKris Kobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically Kobach was a disappointing for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAnd Kobach had to study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purported to show that three million people had voted illegally in the twenties sixteen election and shortly after this meeting with Kobach\nTrump tweeted that millions of people voted legally and when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me\nThat he was the source of Trump's claim and showed me this study that purport to show this however when the author of that study who was a professor at Old Dominion university testified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law\nKoh Buck's own expert disavowed that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted illegally\nKris Kobach has also been an advocate for a new question to be added to the census and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is a voting issue called back advocated for adding a question about citizenship are you a citizen\nMy two voting rights it's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it's used to draw districts for state legislatures it used to draw districts for the U.S house it's used to determine how many electoral votes each state has\nSo the census was instrumental when it comes to voting and what happened according to court documents\nIs that Steve Bannon at the time of the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says I Want you to talk to Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the senses and what Kris Kobach toad Ross as he suggested wording for the citizenship question and then he said it's needed\nBecause right now in his words the illegals or being counted when it comes to representation I I don't want to get to technical here Terry but the the way that districts are drawn is they're based on total population so everyone in a given area is counted\nWhen it comes to drawn a district in deciding what level representation an area should have what Kobach wants to do is restrict those\nDistricts to only counting people who are citizens if you did that\nAreas with lots of non citizens places like Texas and New York and California\nWould have much less representation\nThan places where there's a lot more citizens if Kobach has his way\nDistricts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship what that will mean is that will be a major power shift to Republicans because generally speaking airs lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting then despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nThat the districts are going to become more conservative and this question about us citizenship hasn't been asked on the census since Nineteen fifty and there's a tremendous fear that if it is asked\nLatinos Asian Americans other minorities whether documented or undocumented are going to be afraid to respond to the sense is that the areas where these people live\nWill get fewer political seeds less money less political representation than they otherwise what an affair and accurate census so where does that stand now this question\nRight now there are six different federal lawsuits challenging this question the most high profile lost it as being led by New York and sixteen other states and basically what they're saying is that this\nEffect on people responding to the question that you're going to see how many people are afraid to give their citizenship on the census because they're worried about Donald Trump's immigration policies and they don't want to tell Donald Trump what their legal status\nIs and that's going to affect the entire senses and so if the statue is unfair consensus is that accurate than so many things to the census does is going to be unfair and an accurate as well\nMy guest is Ari Berman author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and senior reporter at Mother Jones after a break we'll talk more about voting restrictions and ballot measures that may expand voting rights and we'll look at the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh on the bench and\nHow it would likely respond to cases

Greenberger\nIn places like Colorado Michigan Utah in Missouri and the biggest ballot initiative the one that could affect the most people is in Florida where they have a ballot initiative\nThat would restore voting rights to ex felons so Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex felons from voting meaning even after you've served your time you've paid your debt to society\nYou have to wait five to seven years in Florida\nTo appeal to have your voting rights restored by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida where one point six million\nEx felons can't though that's a staggering number what that means is that one in ten people in Florida including one in five African Americans in the state can't vote because they have\nAnd if people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections\nAren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia North Dakota and Kansas and other states\nFlorida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news so Rick Scott\nThe governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against three term incumbent males and\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy that has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida is running for office\nAnd the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors and Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush the governor of Florida restores voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons\nCharlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor restored voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex felons in Florida Rick Scott has only restored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida\nDuring his eight years as governor so he has implemented this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect the first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million\nDisenfranchised African Americans aren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\nSo\nIn the past I've certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have been appealed as high as the Supreme Court the Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh to the bench what's his position on voting rights\nHas from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights he upheld a voter id law from South Carolina and twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority voters in that state but cabin I wrote the majority opinion\nSaid that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud that states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent for Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota like Kansas to enact\nNew restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence of the kind of fraud that they are reporting to crack down on they can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to and cabinet as words uh promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court already this was the same Supreme Court remember and Terry and twenty Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing\nThe most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the ... election right now\nThe chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights\nIt's amazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he led efforts\nTo weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored of the twenty Thirteen decision that got the heart of the voting rights act and ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to approve their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea\nThat voting discrimination was still widespread pervasive in his words and in fact everything that we're seeing right now which seemed to contradict that the fact that there are so many new barriers to voting\nBoth in states that were covered by the voting rights act places like Texas and Georgia orange taste that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread\nVoting discrimination that we're seeing right now would seem to argue not just for keeping the voting rights\nStrengthening it to have more protections against voting discrimination but instead the Supreme Court did the opposite and voting rights advocates are extremely worried that all of these new restrictions on voting when they go before the Supreme Court are basically going to be upheld\nThe argument for voting restrictions\nIs fraud that you have to do this to prevent fraud if you look nationally and voting fry how pervasive hasn't been\nEvery study shows that voter fraud is a very small problem in American elections not non existent but incredibly rare that from two thousand to twenty fourteen according to one study there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation out of one billion votes cast\nSo even in states where there are no voter ID laws like New York where I live it's very difficult to commit fraud in New York but we do is we sign our names at the polling station and they have to check\nThat the signature on file matches they signature that were signing when we go to vote well if I wanted to commit voter fraud in New York in a state with out of voter id law I Would have to find a voter I Would have to know what their addresses I'd have to know what their signature looks like I Would have to know that they hadn't voted already\nAnd I would be facing potentially five years in jail a felony conviction a tremendous fine\nAnd I would only be shifting one extra vote after all of that so it doesn't mean that voter fraud never occurs but the penalties for voter fraud are already very high the mechanisms that we have in place already deter people from doing it if you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting\nA very small number of votes one vote usually most\nAnd so what I see based on the data is that the number of people prevented from voting by restrictions on voting is exponentially larger than the cases of voter fraud or see\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is journalist Ari Berman is the author

actually mentioned you are the slapping sounds that you're hearing at the end of that scene that's Paul Dana's character like slapping the devil slapping the devil out of Daniel Day Lewis\nA U.S so getting even with Daniel Day Lewis was beating them up around there in in the film that that is seen as almost like this incredible operatic do wet\nDid you think of it that way when you're making it [noise]\nIt was sort of intense just to hear that you know that it's time for me I I'm I was sort of cast the last minute and this and I started about four days after I was cast in this part\nYou were initially cast as the preachers and brother yeah and then they moved you to be yeah the the teen preacher\nIs that why those two characters ... became twins were they not twins we're there were just brother brother and you know that you were playing both of us so they saw something in you where they wanted you to play the bigger part\nYeah I said I suppose so but you know ... so I mean sort of sort of why I was going back there is is just listen to that clip you know gave me I'm a feeling which was I just remember the the two days before I started\nSpending sun up to sun down in that church alone um you know he lives church and\nThat was a really sort of um\nBeautiful couple of days just sort of trying to learn the script and make contact with the ... the character and in in in this empty church died I don't know why that's what I went back to\nIt was your idea to to learn your part well sitting in the church\nWhen I was just suddenly on location and I was like what okay how well they want is Monday and [noise]\nOkay I'm going to go to the church and learn life seems um [noise] it's funny 'cause that quip to quite a long scenes so that was a sort of seen we film for all all day long and uh\nI Believe our first set up was probably some kind of wider let me some kind of master shop and uh I I slapped Daniel as you said in in towards the end of the scene and\nI think we're supposed to once we get that part just stop you know because what we're going to be doing this all day and\nAnd I remember ah the first take forgetting and just slapping him many times\nTo stop and I went oh God um and I think I ... I even had a little bit of rent on time and you know oh my God was and he just said that's how you doing [laughter] you know and I was like okay [laughter]\nMy guest is Paul dino he co wrote and

she still felt like a school boy about it you know you could be quite uncomfortable about most things but if you were with him and got into music you know he he really but but by lightening sign him I mean\nYou know he's he's really he's giving a piece of himself\nTo us and I think he wanted to help people heal which is such a considering the struggles that he had and you just heard in this scene you know to want to\nGive give that I'm through your music to somebody else who's experiencing you know I'm is just such a beautiful generosity and and gift and you're listening to that scene now it's um you know not it's not just upsetting because he's a musical genius you mean he's offering himself to his dad you know\nAnd we found that totally I get it yeah unseen the core changes in love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those words like you know how to play those courts let alone the sequencing of a\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um and that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teach you the court's not Brian a guy named area and isn't as bad as um helped me\nBy day and saying we're doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say let me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly you know learn you learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through ... through Bryan as his left hand the bass notes\nReally incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the ... note um would you would say if you're playing a gee you know she's often emphasizing a different um note or in the voice thing and that changes the entire sound or the court\nAnd it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney got from the beach boys and started doing as a bass player which was kind of quite revolutionary at the time\nUm so for him in the music to not you know necessarily be landing on the roof note really changes the feeling behind the cord and uh so I learned so much uh and and and I miss it you know listening to that\nI don't listen to them often because it really sends a chill through ... and you know I Do miss
