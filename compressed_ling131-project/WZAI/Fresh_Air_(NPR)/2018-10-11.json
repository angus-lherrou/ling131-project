D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had a kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you'd get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense then\nThen the audience is going to feel at the actors him to be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real the shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight sell uh Ryan ... isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the uh ... Haitian and just physical jostling of all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and and Dave Scott you know ah [laughter] oh we a ride and I both wanted to try and make this physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody fell out in question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh uh apparently started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast night it was getting gas out from where\nWe had to take a we had to take a moment\nWorried for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know are really wants to do as much with himself as as you can ... so I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to ride that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off you hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space capsule or at least it wasn't and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was putting space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean\nA sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of a uh making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of would augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little drones and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire just whenever possible remind them that this is this is a piece by piece a hand built\nMachine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts art something better just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight\nMassive puts together a press they meant about the deaths of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe mhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronauts off into space hoping that\nDonald masses preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release your edgy um get get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it on line and event of moving disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nGiven Heinz who plays ... the whole date is is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can uh again that you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to capture relates in such a poetic beautiful way the\nWillingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speeches says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what they intend to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures a could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil is Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nA live their lives and in seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people of\nMy ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and

seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions of something like that or get aroused I think uh obviously the moon landing was an American achievement and an incredible one\nAnd the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times though the flag standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know and and showing\nThe you know the physical sticking of the rod into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag\nA we made a choice entirely ... choice not a political one to a focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spend about ... minutes from the litter surface we really wanted to spend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what he himself would be seeing\nAnd she'll be for the camera and even gone down and then after his famous line or his own sort of plan to walk off to the little west grader during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras a and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching this um those are the things I think there were really important to us in terms of uh in terms of process\nWhat we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was the product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nAnd I guess ... he directed

Armstrong the first human to walk on the ...\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's a music he actually brought with him to play after the space signing my right about that\nOh this is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah okay yeah so it's\n... piece called lunar Rhapsody ... and ... when I find really interesting about that is that you know\nDescribe it this way with all due respect inhale Armstrong\nLike like Hollywood style celestial voices a therapist in is incredibly like Florida piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like\nBeing ... to the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nCorny version of what you know women are might be it just strikes me as so it's just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how you play music so how did it strike you [noise]\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked to distract and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know or so little known there were also more famous tracks of music that uh that Neal and the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece from by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a ... a listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know or who was having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kinda unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no end in mission control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nI said well why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] oh [noise]\nOh oh oh [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI'm a\n... which Neil Armstrong played on the weight of the moon and it's used in the new movie first man which has directed by ... lots of direct did a lot of land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I found remarkable was that you were working on the land before first man but a lot of land wasn't turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first men are and ah so you know that that was you know a few years in ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know ...\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a thrill out of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I uh I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim and sending\nA fell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way I also if you're a\nYou're into musicals you at the musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and we talked about Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first manned but a lot of land\nBut uh as soon as I learned was done you know this project had been simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical staff you had to deal with like sound effects and we could be seen 'em a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real science and then miniatures it's it's it's\nYou know ... but that's like the choreography in a camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like\nYeah I mean I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing that\nA ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they'd been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day or this was a film but they were are going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under my self and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder\nTo you know really get it right in pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nDidn't you know

what\nWhat was the kind of common understanding of the definition of in the three years\nYou were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nMany students said to me that they weren't sure if groping counted as sexual assault maybe it has to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of those three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you a grass on people in speech and make them feel like justice or like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there are no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line and about this issue I understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we do have a national definition [noise]\nSo um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay\nReally have permission to touch somebody now I guess you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown or pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at us in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is\nA really good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why\nWere you resistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the ways that usually happens means sex is something that is an ... folk and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people and that's part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but\nI Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condom which was always kind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an extra question\n... you read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness one you mean\n[noise] well one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until they end up\nSome of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to fix this problem is about\nGirls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get how\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like\nRules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person and having the full burden of the awkwardness\nExactly so this is a little ... okay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance it may recently\nYou know guys try to come up and downs with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] no I mean his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent I'm I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked\nWas that the first time that happens here that was definitely the first time I did that for today [laughter] I mean I ... yeah I I didn't think that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him I married\nUm I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so I think that's a great thing to have that happen and to have young girls who\nTruly a\nYou know are in night clubs or at dance parties lot understand like this is my buddy I own at people have to ask permission to touch it\n[noise] my guess is Vanessa grew gory artist author of blurred lines sex power
