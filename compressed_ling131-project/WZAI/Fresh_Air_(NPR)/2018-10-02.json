stories on the subject and adding new reporting to those stories Greg Miller welcome to fresh air is your story that you helped break the you consider the most consequential story of\nCandidate or President Trump and his administration what\nI mean there there are several um\nStories are obviously many stories of the Washington Post broke that I had a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing colleagues here\nI think the one that jumps out for for many people is the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with Russian ambassador survey 'cause there\nWe wrote the story saying that he in fact had discussed lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time and a couple of others that I was involved and include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached said that he is secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election was was was trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough conversations\nWith foreign leaders ah we had the transcripts of some of those calls and the story about his um revealing of highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister in the oval office\nThat's not what the ... or I guess that really direct consequences Flynn was fired so and was fired within days yeah yeah so you know you helped write the story that Flynn had calls with the Russian ambassador to the U.S surrogate Kislyak\nAs a reporter there is there is nothing better than to be able to get to the bottom of a complex story that there are so many people who are trying to prevent you from getting it\n[noise] did you face consequences did you get traveled a lot as a result of having an mask this lie\nI mean the ... ... ... absolutely so troll ... attacked a lot um and that has not really a beta [laughter]\nI mean that that continues now not just for me but for a lot of reporters covering the this administration at this really highly politically charged time where we're living through I'm On the other hand we're things happened\nUm

President Trump and the Trump Administration\nStories that have been reported by Miller and other reporters at the Washington Post\nNo you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in\nThe face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had noticed that your immunity I was interested that you use the word lie in\nThe word lying when using the same sentence as Trump [laughter] is very controversial and the journalism world because line implies intent\nYou know a fall so it is when you speak something that isn't true lying implies that you know it's not true and you're saying it anyways so people are just weighing that is a worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want to ask you about how you decide it\nYeah I mean I feel like um\nIt is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being too reluctant to use that word and I think that's true to other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're at here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post to his documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intense I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIt's part of Trump's per se ... very complex personality it's part of it and it traces back to his origin as a as a as a public person um I mean we have run fascinating stories here at the post about\nA times earlier in his career when he would adopt\nPhony persona and call reporters for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there is a there is an intense here and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie\n[noise] after Flynn resigned under pressure\nUm each spoke to Devin noon as the Republican chair of the house intelligence committee and you say that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing CJD by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he tell you\nThis was at a time when we're trying to figure out well we now know that Flynn had discuss sanctions with the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow\nAnd not just raised a lots and lots of questions about well who else was in contact with ... with the Kremlin during the campaign if anyone right so we're we're digging by our news organization and many others and this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee Devon noon as\nWho has who is read into all of the most sensitive intelligence on questions like this\nAnd I was asking him you know what else is there we are seeing lots of indications contact between Jared Kushner and and officials for Moscow and other members of the Trump organist\nAnd he says that the FBI has been looking at this and all and it's all a dead trail\nAnd I pressed him because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already abundant evidence of contact you could say that that was incidental and meaningless and harmless but you couldn't say it didn't exist but he says it you know when I pressed him not even pizza boy delivery contact\nAnd it just struck me at that time that that was\nSo implausible um that he was you know he was trying to throw sand in our eyes basically uh in my eyes as a reporter he was trying to um protect Trump\nAnd that that was um more important to him in that conversation that adhering to the facts that had already been established\nMy guest is Greg Miller who covers intelligence and

I'm not going to trust and not an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are you rules what are your guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really an a really important one\nAt this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources we would really be unable I think to\nGive our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I Want when we say anonymous source the reporter knows who the source as it's the readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know that that really telling you the information\nAbsolutely right the sources are not anonymous to us um these are sources that um we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed\nThey have given us information um and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story in how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions and whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing so sometimes you might be asked well what does the position of the ... where is the source and coming from from the story\nUm who are we talking about here and you can you can basically described their positions in government sometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know\nMore they're going to want you to identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with sore say or source be\nBut it's something you know ultimately despite you know we we all of these accusations and criticisms that's our reliance on anonymous sourcing\nI mean the the record just sort of holds up\nThe stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources of almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were a news organizations aren't perfect and and then can we do make mistakes but boy we've gotten a lot right\nUm and I know Marty Baron executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right\nBut at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right\nIt it's really it would really be damaging to not just the Post's credibility in my credibility as a journalist but to the broader\nUm journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now in its ability to do its job and to do it well and do it right let me try to give you one more example of\nThe reporting environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under as reporters how much pressure our sources are under a as well\nOr when the Justice Department in Congress released the memos that former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept\nEvery time he met with Trump every time he meets with Trump something happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer types up of metal to record what ... what transpired\nOne of those talks about a conversation he had with Trump in the oval office and most of the coverage about that memo focused on their interactions about what Trump wanted him to do in terms of backing away from the Flynn investigation\nBut Trump is also complaining to call me in that in that setting\nAbout the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration he's complaining about how are people Howard news organizations learning what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk and the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post\n... is talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody had on a pike as an example the Trump goes on a joke about putting Trump goes on to put joke about putting just say he believes reporters should be put in jail\nOr in jokes about how once reporter spends a little time in jail they're making new friends suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pikes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving it make you afraid\nWell let me let me ... ... it\nIt made me afraid I ... I was confident enough\nIn my ability in in how I approach sourcing that I wasn't worried about that I work for a news organization that has my back ... um and that's a good feeling\nBut it is frightening in a way Terry and I remember talking about this at home um when I saw this memo describing this document to my wife and what was in it\nAnd our seven year old was at the table with us and he heard me talking about it and using words like jail and he's following this conversation and I maybe it was being\nUp in front of him but he started to cry or he started to get really worried and asked whether I was going to be put in jail um it is frightening it's um\nWe're just trying to do our jobs um we're just trying to get to the truth we're trying to fulfill the role that the founders and vision for for the media in this country and it's an important mission\nMiller thank you so much for talking with us and thank you so much for your reporting\nThank you\nGreg Miller is the author of the new book The Apprentice Trump Russia and the subversion of American democracy he covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm [laughter]\nYou're listening to my point one W C.

uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this an article published in Vanity Fair Greg Miller welcome to fresh air is there a story that you helped break the you consider the most consequential story of candidate or President Trump and his administration what\nI mean there there are several um stories are obviously many stories at the Washington Post broke that I had a a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing colleagues here\nI think the one that jumps out for for many people as the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with Russian ambassador Sergei cause that\nWe wrote the story saying that he in fact had discussed lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time in a couple of others that I was involved and include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached the secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election was but it was trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough conversations with foreign leaders ah we had the transcripts of some of those calls and the story about his um revealing\nIncorrectly because they will be misrepresented in a sense is if this question discourages immigrants from answering so\nWilbur Ross oh did you were you surprised at the choice of him to head the department of commerce since as you say commerce has more to do about data and I don't want to sound ages here\nAnd how it's collected and how it's interpreted has is changing so rapidly and I have no idea if he's kept up with what data means anymore\nWell we know he was falling asleep and meetings where he was supposed to be learning about the department and I know that the people who try to explain to him how the department worked came away and these were Republicans who who were brought in to try to explain how the department worked to him found that he was really utterly disinterested in anything betrayed\nSo even if he was an eighty he just wasn't particularly interested in the mission is apartment an additive at\nWhat became very curious is that the exposure of his finances they put them in a bad order with the White House you know he had to declare its financial holdings ... when he was nominated for\nThe job and it turned out he had two billion dollars less than the Forbes ritual is to calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovers that he'd been lying to the ... rich list all along\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to take a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice he was very odd choice because with that department really is someone who's really comfortable

guy has come in with a sledgehammer\nAnd is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know he's paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know\nOne aspect of the fifth risk\nIs the go a lot of the risk that the government manages are very\nLong term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another a cleaning up uh you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public has gone along with it and that's that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that that kind of level of government where things are being done we positions aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\n... and people and they're people who have the ability to

Noah and\nYou say sixty percent of the ...\nNoah first of all what did you sign on the Commerce Department [laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing you know it eats the Commerce Department and they simply no National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was a ... is the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War in ... Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into Congress department as an act of vengeance so it's there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department a and it does it eat most of the resources\nAnd it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nYou're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather uh that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather predictions are okay well\nI'm so here's the problem are typically the person who runs no uh as as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a fabulous a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but the weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean ... and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nOr all of that saves lives and property or that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let them is that it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather can do it instead\nSo he has had bills introduced in Congress just sexually forbid the national weather service from from doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you at the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIs the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so they can go and you know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayers you'd have to pay for this twice\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\n\nSupport for example UCI comes from you and from ... market and healthy additions on Martha's Vineyard committed to providing for the wellbeing of islanders and offering the ... market program part of the vineyard community for more than one hundred years ... market\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listen politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were running the department of jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of I think he did um as part of the court landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of a name of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpreted as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and they do is you know parts\nEngage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nYou know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works on its assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing pocket because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I and the Trump Administration are getting on ... because there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those department\nSo yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book in this one is what got me into this book in the first place [noise] one of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economists and Amos diversity we were studying the way people judge\nRisk is that when you changed the odds people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that ... there's a one in a million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that\nAnd I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risk of a pandemic or a the risk of a a nuclear accident risk of a terrorist attack or the the one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poison the whole Pacific Northwest\nAnd I thought Trump's approach is effectively taking lots of you know one in a million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely because he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it\nAnd I thought this society doesn't feel it caught him into ... showed you the people don't really feel this and that inside is what got me going in the first place\nSo you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mocked the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse\nMore than recovered over that time but some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done I'm I'm doing what your thoughts are about whether we are now in terms of financial stability and and and world markets\n[noise] well I'm a big question [laughter] well it is a big question you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but\nNo it's not my job but you know if I ... I Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say oh the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole all that money in the first place from is we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a larger way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's gonna be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shocked me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why\nWould if you treat the financial crisis\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots of lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable they'd be a flight out of the dollar\nA U.S treasury bonds of the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket um this is the ...\nWith a bit here but if you asked me to like ... predict\nWhat might trigger a ... I think it's I think I Would predict it's some sort of political of it and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things fundraiser predict things were were ... when they happen they make sense of a lot of things have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fifth risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and commerce departments [noise] we're gonna take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nSupport for double UCI comes from you\nAnd from Decatur House in sandwich in assisted living community in a village setting committed to providing individualized attention for seniors and their families Decatur House family owned for over Twenty years more information educator house dot com and from Dr Neil wrangler general and family dentistry ...\nProud to sponsor to UCI for more than eight years\nLearn more about Dr wrangler at Neal wrangler D.
