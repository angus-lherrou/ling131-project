maybe I don't mean arrogant man just mean that's the type of job you're ...\nAnd honestly one of the hard things for me was that I didn't have any alone time because I'm quite used to that somebody's always asking you a question somebody or you have to make ... million decisions that day\nBut I loved that feeling of collaboration with every little bit of the crew and sort of just helping to create like a space where we could all kind of go to work together and you're almost like parenting like you're just trying to get the best out of every body and I've found that really gratifying\nIf you're

think of it that way when you're making it [noise]\nIt was sort of intense just to hear that you know that it's time for me I I'm I was sort of cast the last minute mess and I started about four days after I was cast in this part\nYou were initially cast as the preachers brother yeah and then they moved due to be yeah the the teen preacher\nIs that why those two characters ... became twins were they not twin and there were there were just brother and they're just brothers but now that you were playing both of us so they saw something in you where they wanted you to play the bitter part\nYeah I should I suppose so but you know ... so I mean sort of sort of why it was going back there is is just listening that could you know give me I'm a feeling which was I just remember the two two days

and um so what did you have to learn those words like you to know how to play those court let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um and that was just so

started practicing day by day\nAnd single doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say let me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly you know learn you learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through piano through Bryan as his left hand the bass notes\nReally incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the route note um would you would say if you're playing a genealogy he's often emphasizing a different um note or in the voice thing and that changes the entire sound of the court and it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney\nGot from listening to the beach boys and started doing as a bass player which was kind of quite revolutionary at the time um so for him in the music to not you know necessarily be landing

basketball I spoke to suck a lot of yesterday when the jury in the case was still deliberating\nWell my ... welcome back to fresh air you know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money does college basketball generate\nWell billions I mean it really depends on how you calculate it directly to the universities and to the NC double a billions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites and all these crazy ways\nYou know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and where does the money go\nThe money largely goes to the adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year\nThe rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches make as much as a half million dollars a year all throughout the athletic department people are making six figure salaries it does not go to the players and what I call the unpaid workforce\nAnd a thousand or more players a couple of hundred college coaches and they're playing in gyms\nAll over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they are being scout at not only by coaches not only by college coaches but also by\nThese characters who exist on the

and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life and one of the things that really struck me when I have been around grassroots basketball\nIs the kids who referred to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick

kind of the family's lives to\nYou write that on the college end of this it's the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're ...\nThe assistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family they fly all over the country\nOn assistant coaches that used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere\nBut the assistant coaches\nThat's their job get me kids thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coach who say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know\nAssistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nBut she had these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of this story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\n[noise] but then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players who are already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the attempt of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n... this is what you do and you managed to have for in some way or another and get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more so\nIf you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that adds up to a whole lot if you were quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars if I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player\nI don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes\nManage their money or if you get traded there are special issue will set you up in a new city they will go to\nPrivate schools and figure out what private school your child should go to they will find you designer for your new house and and interior designer so sports is a very insular business and a lot of the players want to deal with known quantities\nAnd part of this is there's the money manager he manages NBA players money so the game is to become one of those guys and then they have one of these go betweens set you up with a with players\nMichael ... new book is the last

year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI I did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock\nAnd what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college\nW UCI sustaining members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org time\nWas a shock ... and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\n\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so the one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke was quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach case that it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean what\nSports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not\nReal students their loyalty and their their responsibility is to their teen first which takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you are you are having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree coming out with some injuries and yet the NC double a ...\nStudent athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for a\nWhile to come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that the shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nI Do think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be\nAdjusted in the way that people\nConduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful you already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them\nYou know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity\nI think they'll become more careful ... the ... the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grass roots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy you also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on that case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we covered this I mean ... you said that in some respects shooting apparel companies look pretty bad and is what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in these charges\nThe apparel companies have been very quiet they have put out sort of vanilla statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet\nThere is a Adidas executive who is one of the three current defendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and finally James ghetto who this ... executive his father was a high school coach he's an insider he's a basketball inside or almost all of these defendants are well liked well\nThey're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas and Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they're planning on much to change either if they can help it\nMichael ... thanks so much for speaking with us thank you it's great to be on with you\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college
