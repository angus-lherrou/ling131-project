[noise]\nBoom boom boom boom boom\nMobile\nWoman [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with the W. singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media [noise]\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign and they were hip to the importance of this what\nSo it was actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject rigidly and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUh this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign the campaign to twenty twelve opens with\nWell among us militant that's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time a mosque Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how fire\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what have been done about the the weapons caches that had been recovered than a loss would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies of one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see an all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding\nWhose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out but importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nOriginally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a how they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects and\nReorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means and the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world can participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I\nTo download them and serve at the cost and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist in an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in Taylor Swiss army of swift these you can list in the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cause may not be the same but the tactics are\nAnd by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you know giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one pulls from the world at at crowd sources so to speak\nAnd one of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere in ... and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the um ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of hijacking one discussion to drive it through your own ends the same way that ISIS for example\nWould hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's online army would try and hijack discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nThe interview fresh air is Dave Davies recorded with the W. singer and Emerson working authors of

com this\nWrites about conflict in social media was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations also with us pi Wu singer strategist at New America as a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how a social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the Kavanaugh hearings in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and\nIt was in a certain way you had both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military we're using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where uh they were enlisting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nThey wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh too I unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket that\nThen you had the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor for a the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was now that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe um spread of disinformation\nThe spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized and\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this and the Kavanaugh debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona is in the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative\nBe buried underneath this you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself for at least the online place that we go\nWe ... so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russians shoot down an airliner over Ukraine\nRussian um actors go under ... very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where ah he used the term I'm In is a high school yearbook that was a sexual term and during his hearing he says no no no it's not a sexual term it's about a drinking game\nThe problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on week at the DEA to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kind of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms\nAre private companies uh and they are now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nNeural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just ... but maybe in some ways surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad ah so for example they can um\nCreate a wonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of ... for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also is a way to save money or\nThe sheen rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same I chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on the war a certain way\nTo challenge also moves into visual imagery there was an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not\nThe companies and turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks online where a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to a a battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nRight so so so these neural networks like that could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden honoring some you know profane a comment at something\nTo get real world example of this there have already been creations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together\nWhere for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger to ah George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that and meld together to allow you to a in essence create a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in this space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's gonna be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nEmerson ...

D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off to set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense then\nThen the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more ... you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight sell uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real and so that he is really experiencing all of the ah discovery and Haitian and\nJust physical jostling of all of this yes\nYou know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and and Dave's got you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try to make this physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up in a hard question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because he started to uh apparently started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast night it was getting gas out from where we had to take\nA we had to take a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second uh cause riots that type of actor who really just you know are\nReally wants to do as much with himself as as you can ... so I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nOr if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quiet at all inside the space cats a recent lessons and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was putting space in film ... is actually how you can play with sand or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know uh this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of ah making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse\nThemselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks a little drones and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive\nPuts together a press state meant about the death of the men on a flight\nBecause they're planning for possible catastrophe mhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't that's I guess they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy a press release eulogy um did get that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the uh you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy\nYou see a a junior in high school plays about Gilbert movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can ah again you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's really I mean it's it's a\n... actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a wading caps elites in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intend to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what do you sort of a risky costly brave ventures or could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil if Neil Armstrong knew it national which writing has a ... [noise]\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues is just how close to death they\nAre live their lives and in seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people up\nI guess just ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed at la la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break and light trucks will review a new set of ... recordings of ...

the flag material the movie you know I think it was a\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that or get aroused I think uh obviously the moon landing was an American achievement and an incredible one\nAnd the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times though the flag standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each be to the mission and mapping out you know ... and showing\nThe the physical sticking of the rod into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag\nA we made a choice entirely anesthetic choice not a political one to a focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spent about eight minutes on the litter surface we really wanted to spend that time to look at\nThings that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what he himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous line or his an sort of plan to walk off to the little west grader\nDuring which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about I didn't know about before\nThere were really important to us in terms of in terms of process what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice through throughout the movie\nMy guest is Damien ... he directed the new movie first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a

directed the new movie first men starring Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the ...\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think it was a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing on my right about that\nThis was music he plays on the way to the moon things what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah okay yeah so it's\nLess Baxter piece called lunar Rhapsody ... and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices a therapy and this incredibly like Flora and piano if it's like\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support WC I at Cape and islands data work [laughter]\nTwenty version of what you know women are might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange and I asked somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you playing music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm a it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a ... mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I\nThink it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a so Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that are that Neal is to the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece from about divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a ... a listens to together that they loved together when they were young and in love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know or who was having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening knowing image control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay why don't we hear a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nOh [laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThat's an interesting which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and it's used in the new movie first man which has directed by ... who also directed a lot of land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and the thing I found remarkable was that you were working on la la land before first man but a lot of land wasn't turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first men are and ah so you know that that was you know a few years in ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a thrill out of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I uh I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen in\nA fell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way I also hear ah\nYou're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and we talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first manned but a lot of land\nBut uh as soon as I was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which they so much technical staff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real science and then miniatures it's it's it's\nYou know la la land was a complex film but that's like the choreography in a camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like technically difficult in a in a whole other level [noise]\nI mean I I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit the risks\nKnowing that a a ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they'd been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were a going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they were to see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under myself and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get a ride and pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nThey mentioned bell thank you so much for talking with us it's been great to have you back on our show and congratulations on thank you so nice
