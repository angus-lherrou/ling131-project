knows behind a closed door and the men denies it\nThat's an issue universities have been grappling with\nMy guest Vanessa ... is the author of blurred lines sex power and consent on campus over the course of three years she interviewed a hundred twenty students from twenty universities spoke with nearly eighty administrators and experts and read dozens of case reports\nShe says that while writing the book she witnessed a historic moment when survivors move from the shadows to the spotlight versed on campus and then nationwide with the me too movement\nGoogle Riyadh is is a contributing editor at the New York times magazine in Vanity Fair and has won a national magazine award\nVanessa grigorian is welcome to fresh air you know you write in your book that there's a new understanding of what rape and sexual assault means that started on college campuses but with me too movement it's spread beyond campuses\nWhat'd you the Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation tell you about how far that new understanding has spread I guess what I'm asking you is this if if the Republican senators in the Judiciary Committee had gone to college campuses\nWhat'd you think some of the things or they would have been told about ... what did you take into consideration before voting\nThings that they might not have thought of in part by as the Republicans on judiciary were men a lot of them are older men if you know their college days were very different in terms of thinking about sexual assault\nIf so senators had I'm Ben on college campuses as presidents or administrators are title nine officers they would have had a completely different set of questions right because they would have already known what college campuses no about sexual assault which is very few women make it up\nVery few women are excited to get there and report and feel like this is their moment in the limelight\nSomething like not having reported for many years is not a big deal most sexual assault survivors and don't actually report for awhile and they wouldn't know that\nThey might not actually get a lot of evidence because there's very rarely\nCases particularly those that happened thirty six years ago so they have to look at the credibility of each percent\nSo um have hurt guidelines taken effect yet no they haven't\nThey were leaked to the New York times on there will be a notice and comment period or you know we have to see also if she's going to put these these were draft that the time\nMy guest is Vanessa group ... author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus we'll talk more after a break this is fresh air\n\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with the ... author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nMany students said to me that they weren't sure if groping counted as sexual assault maybe it had to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of the three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault this maybe even the way you speak to people the way you abreast on people in speech and make them feel like justice uh like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were\nThinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there are no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in late ... about this issue I understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition\n[noise] so um you\nIs being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there is a huge difference something I guess means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now [noise]\nAh yes you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable intervening which I suppose means I'm mon are grown are pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at this in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question that you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why\nWere you resistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sex is something that is an ... folk and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people and that's part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but\nI Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nI'm into an act we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always kind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an extra question\n... you read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness when do you mean\n[noise] well one of the complexities of sexual assault\nBoys saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well\nMaybe another time uh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until they end up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to\nFix this problem is about girls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get how\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like\nRules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever\nUm but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances and you have to say no no no stop no I really means that no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person and having the full burden of the awkwardness exactly so this is a little\nDorky okay if you it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance and I\nRecently you know guys try to come up and down with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here\nAnd I said no\n[laughter] no I mean his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent and I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked\nWas that the first time that happened here that was definitely for stuffing fight it out for today I mean I ... yeah I I didn't think that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him I married\nUm I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so\nI think that's a great thing to have that happen and to have young girls\nWho truly a you know are in night clubs or at dance parties a lot understand like this is my body I own at people have to ask permission to touch it\n[noise] my guest is Vanessa ... author of blurred\nAnd on campus we'll talk more after a break can Tucker will review in early recording by hazel Dickens and now is Gerard who

flipside to that but they were adamant with me that this was only to the good that they were presenting themselves\nShe reading your book we're in the process of developing new power dynamics in the bedroom an\nArea where feminism has previously not been able to reach so attached to explain what you mean by that I think this raising of\nDemons that has been going on through the meat you era is

what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a [laughter] I was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I I never um\nMy audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight it was gay people that didn't like other gay people let's say three [laughter] it was hippies just didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outside a group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes and in the beginning underground movies when I made them\nThey were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always by doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did an and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe me that was to go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I liked Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy of how she pronounces it um so I I wasn't I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did a newer version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the role of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people but kidnap models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player in it and there's the same or divine isn't drag just weird dried but with no way gone 'cause we were trying to\nEven offend I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously and he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazines but there were many off at the time fan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves\nAnd we have the whole thing the capital K I mean up pitiful version but we have the chef for our we have 'em all the people

is score to our classical music where there's one note that if the gun shot and then divine crawls over the top of a car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphic but it was filmed so

wall and you have to go around the wall [laughter]\nI'm In ... for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with divine when this film that you're referring to play against the Kennedy devine was a very heavy man who who usually played a woman Indian movies and pattern himself in some of those rules on an Elizabeth Taylor\nAnd and what do you think of real drag queens at the time\nWhether they
