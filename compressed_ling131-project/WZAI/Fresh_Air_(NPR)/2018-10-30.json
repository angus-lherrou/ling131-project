out of hatred\nAnd focuses on the story of Derek Black\nTheir ex father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an heir apparent in the movement but here we now is racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties\nAnd a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with fast slow this morning ... welcome back\nTo a fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing you back to our program when I heard about the massacre the synagogue I thought about your book ... black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black\nIs still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull a trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find Don black story relevant to the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert Bowers\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and gone work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter a straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body yet attached to a fourteen eighty eights to white nationalist slogans fourteen refers to a fourteen word\nSort of statement of purpose that is central to what strong fucked us about securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children you know in and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide I Can't stand by and watch my people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on store front and that's the way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is under way\nYeah it was a um a Bowers had had said that um he believed the Jews were committee\nWell ... genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believed the Jews are committing genocide\nDoesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people on gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have\nThere is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gap yeah and I think the danger of a place like gab um and also the danger of of other social\nPeople who already have some of these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and that was when he went on gab he saw the message is only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and\nThat those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and wash my people get slaughtered and that's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting and in a God\nI'm In ... is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about a year and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the sound your son so so what are you reading on storm front now\nSome really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that's\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself but our our global is and that\nJews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect but every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so have you spoken with either gone or guarantee black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nI've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and I think that he's heartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens\nHe feels in small ways culpable and he wanders um you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism plays into you know incidents like this and there was a central\nThat's a popular today somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people and we've got building things phrase that you yourself spread again and again on the radio for years wife if it gets its author\n... slow is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek lack of former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist fight storm front\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\nNo\nIn the new no no no no\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe'd like to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Derrick black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we noun sing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black is the subject of the book rising out of hatred my Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eliza ... who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included fast though the first question was addressed to dark black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than\nWhite national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by my race is like yeah but it popularized the term white nationalism in so that was his thing\nHe didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when\nUnity and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and now that was a\nNot about superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's is totally irrational I how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know the early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nOr whether they really believed that there was a difference between white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better um\nThe the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nIn central is everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo they they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward they lay their clients to word um\nLess out over the years if you look at the language in terms of how many people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively pursuing an end\nIs into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguished movement in the same way because much of much of the country\nWas founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures are based on white supremacy so\nThat's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still\nEffective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick lack a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more

language of vines you just change to the actors are\nAnd who the victims and live an hour and ... and the ... and this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in other countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or posting and the comments section and that quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people who are making society worse\nGetting back to being attacked ... it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know wouldn't be quote unquote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nTalking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had because society was trying to\nHurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the endpoint the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean that you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what ... percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and your racism nebulous thing fits that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining there\nWas a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nUh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those with how are we going to define who is white because only a white person can be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white\nWas that you had a generally be\nConsidered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even

get back to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader who announced his views when he was twenty to his father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter Eli Sasha\nSlow the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred\nSo they're one of the things you did you have been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any belief outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book was a pretty liberal college in Florida that were Jewish people there you actually tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must have publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's their black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found out who you really are um you had your friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who dated if we didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nI I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stevens than and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew ... dinners took the strategy that I think was very\nUh not talking to me about it uh I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up ... every other thing that we were possibly interested in did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after it we're talking about him or die but his life and this is very human\nAnd he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about what we're thinking about Jewish people\nAnd that effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups there already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where I said this is this is crazy when you stop attacking Jewish people to back off\nIn addition to being\nThe story of dark transformation I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was a civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah\nWho won one is trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through in and uh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and\nAnd then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build their relationship hoping that just by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass this\nTo the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners which sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site\nAnd they would see the horrible things that he said about Jews and and ... yeah\n[noise] uh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and are are are sort of the number one

boarders in the Nineteen nineties we'll be right back and we'll talk about some of the films he starred in\nAfter the break this is fresh air\n[noise] during an election WBAI helps you be informed

guest is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would\nBe willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early script\nThe episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter if certain so [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie and\nI wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten and I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old\n[laughter] who is who Marge was Don Corleone because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer\nSo she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dawn [noise] no excuse me she's Michael so OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael wait at home or fan\nNo Homer see that would be but that would make Marge Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mine I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nLewis Diane Keaton like [laughter] where are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were Lenny was Frito and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the M fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who ...\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things I I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film like I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're at another place\nThe film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise]\nUm they said we're so lenient you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange well kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminal movie in my life kids is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down and this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it um a friend of mine who ice skate boarded with who is older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York\nI completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot murder of film because it went over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] disturbing and I need to talk to [laughter] I was like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to them about what I had seen what shape you also about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was to have you so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this stuff for a reason yeah and then I of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two things that are ...\nComfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nI guess is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in their mid Nineteen nineties\nWe'll talk more after a break and Marine Corps again will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American whose murder in Nineteen fifty five in Mississippi galvanized the civil rights movement\nI'm Terry Gross and this is

you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but now he's a screenwriter and director in this directorial debut is called mid nineties and set among a group of teen skate boarders in the mid nineties\n[noise] you know it's been interesting to like first see kind of like I'm coming to manhood onscreen 'cause she was started in your teens I'm super bad you a lot in your early twenties yeah\nAnd and now and like in the past I don't know bunch of years five six seven years you started playing more dramatic roles\nYou know in films like Wall Street and money ball [noise] how did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatic well [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ... told me and then and Catherine Keener and then Bennett Miller was making money ball\nMe to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and it kept me money ball\nAnd then in the interim or\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun\nAnd then uh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um I knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really watch so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry Levinson or people that started out in comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life\n[noise] why don't we hear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese\nAnd written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan bill Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny A's off played by you\nWho eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting\nUm so you start the scene\nSuch a gun on\nFeel for what you actually see that call\nAnd I think we live in\nWillfully lying for full affairs when your kids right ... [laughter]\nFor work or do you do in stock broker Stockton [noise] germs runs her own good for you [noise] so right [noise] you're drama [noise] you know do a risk for myself I'm trying to put it together in my car in the same building I'm just I'm not\nUnderstand how much money [noise]\nOn Seventy thousand last month [noise]\nI'm Serious and announcers to six hours one [noise]\nFor told you so many thousand technically Seventy two thousand [noise] something like that [noise] semi too [noise]\n\nI tell you what [noise] you show me a taste for Seventy two thousand dollars I quit my job right now and I worked for you [noise]\n\nHey Pauline what's up\nNo yeah everything's fine\nHey listen I quit and he he quit his job which I thought was a little weird I mean I just met the\nGets also as a business or well the things about him to like his phosphorus and white T if I got to deal with your wife back to the war warning rooms with clear lenses just look more wash\n[laughter] okay so that's a scene that Leonardo DiCaprio and my guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what\nDid you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on off of Wall Street\n[noise] just honestly so many things I guess the main lesson I learned\nWas that it's okay not to judge your characters to just show their behavior as people and the characters in his films often do really ugly things and you still find humanity and then\nAnd I like\nHow unabashedly and unapologetically she shows human behavior for better or worse which is something you've tried to do when you're in a movie\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to meet in art in general and something I'm\nAnother film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties\nIf we don't want to leave your back to The Simpsons I mean I kind of you as a terrible father ... I mean it terrible father [laughter] you just can't be viewed but he also in Italy loving big hearted person right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area okay\nSo this weekend the Saturday you going to host Saturday Night live November third\nSomething I'm going to play an excerpt of a Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most to me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played a six year old who's with a step mother\nHad a vending hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insults directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by NASA bear and she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nInappropriate inappropriate you listening to NPR on the drive over my nightmares what took place in Syria in stock Terry Gross [laughter]\nMaybe good listening I don't want to train whistle every once in a while [noise]\nOkay and you say [laughter] but I was so shocked and in light of the name ... are you on the show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous to here at this moment oh it's just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic\nThe whole thing was like he like an old man but he's still a little kid\nSo the fact that he has to listen to NPR incredibly boring to a kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show was such\nAnd understanding [noise] but that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first I'm this is my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise] um\n[noise] and I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Eddie Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there and\nA bill Hader and told a story about a going to a Benny ... in his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter] and when that\nClapped his one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style I think I just started doing the kid is if you were like an old Catskills comedian and and that's where when I got her a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that as a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times\n[noise] well don't health thank you so much for coming on the show it's just been great to talk with you thank you to\nJonah Hill wrote and directed the new film mid nineties\nAfter we take a short break marine card and we'll review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American who was murdered in Mississippi in Nineteen fifty five the outrage that followed became a catalyst in the civil rights movement this is fresh air\nSupport for double UCI comes from you\nAnd and the ... theater in New Bedford presenting the new Chinese acrobat for November tent", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Brewster", "day": "30"}
