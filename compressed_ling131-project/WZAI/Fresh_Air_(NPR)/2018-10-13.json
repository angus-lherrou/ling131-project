affectionate and funny or much to the teen dance shows he used to watch in Baltimore\nLast Sunday the Baltimore museum of art opened a major exhibits devoted to John Waters running through January six it's called John Waters indecent exposure and he's the first major retrospective of his visual art in his hometown of Baltimore\nA companion catalog has been published compiling not only visuals from the works and photos of John Waters but also from other works that inspired him\nJohn Waters has been a frequent guest on fresh air\nIn two thousand four Terry interviewed him about an exhibition in New York's new museum of contemporary art it was a photographic series waters began in the early nineties many of the photographs were tribute to his favorite films which not surprisingly include many old exploitation films and tawdry melodramas\nMost of the pieces Terry ask John Waters about in two thousand four also included in the new exhibit at the Baltimore museum of art including a photographic sequence from the movie Peyton place he told Teri why that Phil means so much to him\nPlace were first dirty book I've ever read I Love grace metallic was that I've never read the book the Wii U Betty's crotch uh-huh [laughter] no dirty but uh in Nineteen fifty six that were pretty dirty and oh it's great you ought to repay place or is there any sequels\nIt's like a woman for a [laughter] but grey metallic has that famous author shot of her and the lumberjack gotten a dirty ponytail fitting if a typewriter and I was so obsessed I even went to her grave I went in her house where she wrote the book but\nTapes arms off the radio but then so I could sing them all lip sync from basically so I always I was a puppeteer as a kid I I had a I had a job I had a career when I was twelve years old or puppeteer\nSo I always had an outlet for this that that was encouraged\nNot exactly the work that they wished I was doing but but I I guess they figured it was this or nothing maybe or prison [laughter]\nBut they were very supportive which was very I'm very very encouraging and I I always say that if if you've got a kid that doesn't fit in those rebelling in any way encouraging if your if your daughter comes home and she just had her entire face tattooed what you can you do maybe she'll open a tattoo parlor that will do well that's all you can you got to deal with what you got\n[noise] since you didn't feel guilty about watching things in being obsessively interesting interested in things that weren't supposed to be healthy did you go the other direction figured well I might as well plan up to the hilt and and be you know take on the pose of of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I I I took on\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have\nAny advertising that no one knew who was what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a [laughter] I was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I I never um [noise]\nMy audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight who was gay people that didn't like other gay people let's say three [laughter] it was hippies just didn't like hippies\nIt was it was always the outsider of another outsider group that that's that's what my audience began with\nAnd certainly I'm I encourage that\nBut it seemed to work because yes in in the beginning underground movies when I made them\nThey were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always by doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did and and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe me that was\nTo go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I liked Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy is how she pronounces um so I I wasn't I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did a newer version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the role of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people that kidnapped models and force them to eat their make up a model themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player in it and there's the same or divine isn't drag just\nWe're trying to even offend I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously\nAnd he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazines but there were many off at the time\nFan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing the capital Kate I mean a pitiful version but we have the chef for our we have 'em all the people that were in the car we have Secret Service agents\nAnd I'm divine as waving to the crowd there are no crowds that was filmed on my parents' street and lives in Maryland I'm Maurice avenue and a\nAnd a and then it is scored to our classical music where there's one note that as a gunshot and undermine crawls over the talk of the car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphics but it was filmed so primitive way that's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white ah\nSixteen millimeter grainy over expose that when I took pictures on the twenty five thirty years later it began to look like the real the brood are filmed them one of the most famous a millimeter movies ever so I'm ... I I I did a a photo of peace based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago\nAnd it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke that I'm a Carney while I Believe in our world that the frame as the hype the frame as the advertising campaign so to me it was too big\nFor one wall and you have to go around the wall [laughter]\nI'm In and food for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with divine who in this film that you're referring to like Jackie Kennedy devine was a very heavy man who who usually played a woman Indian movies and pattern himself in some of those rules and listen to him\nAnd and what do you think of real drag queens at the time\nWhether they were square at the time you know I think ... divine help make drag queens ally Hepburn they all wanted to be best Meyerson him and\nSo it was they were really square they weren't happy ever\nNow all drag queens or hip I mean you see him that we'd stock and they're all really funny in a sense of humor and they have funny names everything but but then they were very very serious I remember in Philadelphia there's a great movie called the queen about a drag beauty contest\nIn Philadelphia I Know where where you live and Harlow was the winner and I'm very very famous a drag queen but but we used Elizabeth coffee who was at the time I'm\nMuch more ludicrous and much more funding\nUsed to being a drag queen of as being um comedy terrorists which I think um was much more useful in film than than just a man trying to be a pretty woman\n[noise] you know early in your career you said that your work is really about the sadness normal people feel because they're not involved in show business [laughter] so what\nHe said that about ... I didn't mean to be snobby ... believe that most everybody secretly imagine themselves in show business at every day on their way to work for a little bit depressed because there are people are fab there in a famous America [laughter]\nI guess you really needed to be famous [laughter] um well I I I certainly can't complain about it\nHate to hear people that are in show business to complain about\nAny of that kind of thing but what on earth did you pick that field to go in for if you didn't want people to recognize you I've I've always said that show business is filled with the most insecure people of all of it that we base a life on having to get\nApproval strangers from everything we do over and over and over on each project\n[noise] you know in your book there's a lot of skills of movies and I'm not to stills from movies that were transplanted in their time or you know violating some taboo in some small way [laughter]\nYou also have to first failed or ... yeah but you
