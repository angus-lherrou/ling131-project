Haskell welcome to fresh air and congratulations on being a finalist for the national Book Award Oh thank you so much Terry Gross [laughter] so did you go out of your way for many years not to tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nThroughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting because they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we're going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise]\nAnd my grandfather he sent me down on the couch and he says it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's that's why she's been gone all this time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend like right next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these ... and your families I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward um you know as I get older sometimes I ... I Would share stories with people in high school some watch\nThey call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand twelve that I share the story more widely\nGreat and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nI got to go back to school or do we care about [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crass though you know they'd curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you Kurds but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know um they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather\nJust be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking you know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience to the point where he said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm gonna get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer you die yeah you'd actually well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also a heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to 'em\nYou know she she died the summer before my wedding and unfortunately she died ah she died on a friday on my wife's wedding shower with that Sunday\nAnd the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time Gina now my wife she'd be over and and uh my ... my grandmother was hooked up to oxygen and we always thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and you know like you know she's smoking\nRight with the oxygen around her notes oh gosh ... we're so lucky the house didn't explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents were different people when they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was uh my my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother stopped is that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had from my mother Leslie because that took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always ... uh ... surely was also drinking ... a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit and my mother was young\n[noise] you know had recurrent nightmare as as a child\nNightmare [noise] this recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters and so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around\nAnd make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters when they start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there there in the book and and those were difficult to drop because um you know writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to gates lanes school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then it was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school St building for all those nine years\n[noise] your grandparents later told you that they often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of it um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly were the kind of people who thought he should talk about your problems I mean I'm\nA therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help a distinct ties you seeing someone is talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because uh I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nLead you to art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nOh he was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was ... extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was ... that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles this is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as a as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people\nAre judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that ... comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artists are drawing them professionally at ... in that moment uh and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAnd he tells you you have your own style and that you should develop that he did that upset and what did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comic books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics with that that was actually useful for you\nYou certainly are there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know at the the punches like really real back or the punches been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value on that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know [laughter] real one is ...\nDon't you know everything about her [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J.

relationships and sexism season five is set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that's a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics bow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBut one season one of bull jak horsemen begins bow jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and he spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of a sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then\nLet's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on the Charlie Rochelle\n[noise] in Nineteen Ninety seven situation comedy horsing around me or don't ABC Show which young bachelor horses forced to reevaluate its priorities we agrees raised three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and suffering and not good\nBut the family comedy struggled with America went on to air for nine seasons star of horses around ... or ... ...\nIt is good to be your Charlie [laughter]\nOkay Raphael blah Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter] ... wearing leader you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be\nExcused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode one the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know look at bow jak who was such a mess and all that far into and unprofessional and Charlie Rose a ... by ... is our our straight person in the scene\nAnd yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause there wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it is interesting now to to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse as bright and colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some fun surprising ways\nLiked that sneak attack into sadness instead and some fun ways [laughter] far north as quick as it kind of sadness I like the final version [laughter] and and oh jak as it's\nOf all he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWell let's say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt of the possible deniability like he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in uh Portland but maybe minor distinction to us that he is so does spotted and despairing that he's willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself [noise]\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one lung monologue bow jacks mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at a Mike her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and this is well our net as Beau jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horse around fiercely they'll hold your applause\nWell held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah limb\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network at a note maybe don't mentioned they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to lung for\nAny way we did this one season finale we're Libya's birth mother comes through it she was a junkie but she's got her so cleaned up and she was to be the live your life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya or go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted in any way that we're supposed to water be careful\n... way of letting you do but Libya\nJust thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia dust\nJuiced because there is a Libya gone for good\nBut of course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother at a relapse and they had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. out in the cast stop of course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not handled Libya on the show\nYou shouldn't have happy endings sitcoms not really because\nIf everyone's happy to show would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier\nYou were born broken your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip\nThat um he ended our our fans because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to um what made you think about that [noise] well you know I I I think\nA big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself\nAnd I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think\nWhat's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe on a personal level level that nobody is era deem a ball or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven\nAnd how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've heard so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption and I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension\nReally interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement was so so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the series or you you and the writers is do we forgive you award you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the lea\nFor sure but we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a\nWe forgive you award from I think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger and\nIt one of the sad\nSlash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is\nThat our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and they're able to kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized that and then over the course of the last year\nIt started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just in the last month or so it started to feel like\nOh no wait maybe more forgiving\nI don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years well\nIt makes me think that people are being forgiving again\nWell or it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers and I I don't know if we have we forgotten\nHis anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her his use of of racial slurs\nIn Mr ... me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nThat it still feels like we are not you know Louis C K A stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation a there are reports that Garrison Keillor and and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is work that those men can be\nWould personally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I found it tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is ... the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series bow jak horsemen after a break hotel\nHe'll tell us why he had second thoughts about some of the jokes from season

Blacksburg and he's the executive producer creator and show runner of the Netflix animated comedy tragedy series a bow jak horsemen which is now being shown on reruns on Comedy Central\nSo watching the series especially like after the eulogy episode\nI would've thought that you were a bitter mental at a very troubled childhood\nReading about you a little bit my impression is that was not so your parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rented Jewish bookstore your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the U. S. um tell us a little bit about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area and so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids\nBooks and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I even after\nA high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt a extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of minorities that were chips\nUm we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that says happy Halloween because it's missing an end so we have the the misfit toys go um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life um and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWith the disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it's not like a thing of the past it felt like oh\nThe Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live and sophisticated [laughter] now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um and\nIt's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power\nAnd there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me um but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening um especially big some for someone who\nYou know as a Jew you hear the story of the Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming\nIn it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing\nThem and cutting off their beards and so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know it's actually one of the Jews who control the media\nGuess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kinda feel like oh no there's people who believe that they set up because there's the ...\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nGlad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nIt was it difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there was something that really interested in me I\nCould focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in and there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave and\nYou know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time\nThat I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience that I Love making people laugh but a lot of it too is I I\nHad trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize it inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my pants or everyone can see my underpants\nAppropriate and and I remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being a watching the boundaries I did because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified that oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur [noise]\nHad a funny joke I Would just say it's a you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it and I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and\nIt's not okay I thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least um\nWell I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I\nA comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps in what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space where are you where you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there's so many pop culture references\nAnd bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch them of them\nUm so it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there was a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh\nFrom an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in feel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful as being a writer and having an outlet and now\nIf I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing\nI can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and I'll have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it was a funny situation you know oh wouldn't that be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this I can save and go you know why would I give us away for\nFree in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting another story later so having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is is running bow jak witches Netflix series now that Comedy Central is raining it starting with seats\nLike for you because you in retrospect feel like some of the jokes and season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks and making or the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to\nKeep their dignity\nAs an episode of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this work without those moments and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but I also saying look this is the show and\nIt has to do exist on its own terms and\nHopefully people you know as they have embraced the showing Netflix will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will see those laws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "17"}
