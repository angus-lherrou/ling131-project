by my guest journalist Michael Lewis who's also the author of the best sellers money ball and the big short which were adopted into films and the undoing project\nLewis looks at Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or a corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany essential positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says I filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this in articles published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is is the risk that you fail to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is what I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nI come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as a wandering around the federal government try to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what I'm asking people in the Energy Department of agriculture partner even the White House to name kind of the top risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of this so I thought that's the moment where the mind failed to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it the fifth risk now that you've explained with a fifth risk means\nWhat was the response to what I found about how the Trump Administration going about taking over the federal government we're kind of light to fire under me is what I discovered that the Obama administration and spent the better part of a year and\nThousands of people's lives preparing essentially the best course at at every been created in in how to run the federal government\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting to death election and they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to to receive these briefings or and nobody showed up nobody debris in many cases when I go get get get these briefings I'm the first person to have got them\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis is best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers\nHis new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow among others so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the mother investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid to what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level\nAnd I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a trivial enterprise the biggest ... we don't say doesn't function without the government government is is it's been suggested to decades and decades of of abuse and scorn and it's collected Ross and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer\nAnd is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know who's paying much attention because of slow moving stores and this to me you know\nOne aspect of the fifth risk\nIs the go a lot of the risk that the government manages\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another ah cleaning up or you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise\nA very short term attitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public has gone along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that that kind of level of government where things are being done we physicians aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions of the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in his death threats atomic bomb includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and\nYou say sixty percent of the Commerce Department is really Noah first of all what they're doing in the Commerce Department\n[laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and they simply don't National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was services the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War in ... Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so it's there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department a and it does it eats most of the resources\nAnd it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather uh that sounds actually like a good fit he runs a weather predictions service [noise] well\nI'm so here's the problem ah typically the person who runs NOAA has as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operate\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a fabulous a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but the weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nOr all of that saves lives and property or if that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress just actually forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a of a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIs the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the ah adopt the radar the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know\nAdvertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the date of the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he has been trying to do is Oregon ... is actually a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with a government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're saying that the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons are the high tech stuff that I'm\nIn no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is a naturally\nAnd so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast for the public\nSo Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yeah\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from cancer treatment centers of America\nWorking to outsmart

it was the best but you don't have to touch customers\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listened politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were\nRunning department energy had the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um as part of the quote landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and they just you know part of the department of energy's mission to\nEngage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing ... because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I in the ... are getting on ... because there aren't a lot of\nPeople to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those department\nSo yes but there's actually there's actually a direct connection between the undoing project my last book and this is what got me into this book in the first place [noise]\nOne of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economists and Amos diversity who are studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the ... people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that it is a one in a million chance of it happening\nAnd change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that and I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approach the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risk of a pandemic or or the risk of a a nuclear accident arrest of a terrorist attack or no one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches\nPlutonium into the Columbia River and poison the whole Pacific Northwest\nAnd I thought Trump's approach is effectively taking lots of you know one in a million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely because he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it\nAnd I thought this society doesn't feel it\nPeople don't really feel this and that inside is what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mocked the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done I'm I'm I mean what your thoughts are about whether we are now in terms of financial stability and and and world markets\n[noise] well I'm a big question what is it a question I mean you're asked me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but\nNo it's not my job but you know if I ... I Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption and the treasury bond market they stole all that money in the first place from us we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a larger way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's gonna be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shocked me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why\nWould if you treat the financial crisis\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots of lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable they'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for us\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support WC I at Cape and islands dot org\n... then treasury bars are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it some sort of political of it and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things funding or predict things where where\nWhere they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department [noise] we're gonna take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nMm [noise] Mm [noise]\nI mean the main the main [noise]\n\nIn Maine in [noise]\n\nMm [noise] Mm\n[noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis his new book the that's the risk is about the federal government under Trump\nA lot of the government as a often dismissed as being a bureaucracy that slows down anything supposed down enough and prevent anything from getting done and that it just like layers and layers of of bureaucrats have like managers and I'm so lazy\nAnd understanding of like our bureaucracy changed through writing these stories\nOh my God I so I didn't know what I was going to find when I start knocking on the door of the Energy Department or the agriculture department of Commerce Department and I turned out having exactly the same experience\nThe political people have when they're appointed to these jobs running these places and have these some preconception but vague preconception of what the bureaucrats are like\nUm this happens over and over again that that a new administration comes in\nIf they have kind of contempt vague contempt for the people who were there and four years later they walk out and say those are the most amazing people I've ever worked with\nI I expected to be brief can be you know baby kind of informed by these people I did not expect to be inspired by them\nThe kind of person who is still working in our government despite all the abuse the government takes is is a mission driven person they're not pay well\nUh they they are because they're interested in the task the people in the national weather service or people who have had a passion for the weather since they were little kids the people in the department of energy scientists about a passion for their particular science since they were little kids\nYou're listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations service of W GBH radio\nListening to WBAI your news and information source to the gate coast the islands\nPoint one W ca I W E A R HD one would hold Martha's Vineyard one point one W and and then took it for ... dream to be a rooster and continue to do three eighty nine point seven Boston on line and Cape and islands dot org and\n...

feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I started to understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of a leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori is time ever said that exactly\nBut I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of like a license to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not wife part not the

mention that hammer Jenkins also wrote and directed the savages and slums of Beverly Hills\nSo they're spoken after each of your future in films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you were forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband you said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty\nYour father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and you raise you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter] um what was the experience for you like having a parent who was older and most of the other parents\n[noise] yeah I mean he was also and he was\nI met with like having a Damon Runyon and character is your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway um and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about\nOh you know well you know oh honey you know well you just give that to your grandfather and I started to correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it\nAnd I and and then it was sort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking is Paul malls and his sued and and had a compulsive gambler like he was really like a character\nSo you made three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent uh your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when you live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills and he was broke\nBasically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so he'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there and it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages\nIs based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home and he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing um in part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type 'em right and there was an estrangement need\nBetween you know between the director and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies\nIs um is family and you know\nOne wanting to have one and I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parenting during that time has made you so focused you know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there was actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother we live with our father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your mother today are arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ...\nWe moved away from living with my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother who's ten years older than me um had been\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and I was working in a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Moran high school for a second\nAnd then um\nWas worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to move with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it's because I he paid attention well then I didn't move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parent\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents and we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy my brother was you know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and ... student loans and my brother took out\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] that's cool [noise]\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\nUm well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had an LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to have the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like is because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in\nUm um and then when we lived with my mother she was I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and there was never food in the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail olives and\nThings that you would put in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail\nOriented and then um yeah there's a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and ... on her yeah ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah I was in between Harvard Square and Porter Square off mass of so was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah yeah it was just a book Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England they just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting ... like twenty five was ...\nSome of just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at this you're pulling stuff out\nDr gross I'm not that that's that even in the wreckage there's this kind of makeshift family that gets put together by any means necessary and in a way all of these movies are sort of like that [noise]\nWhatever Jenkins it's great to have you back on our show thank you so much thank you hammer Jenkins\nWrote and directed the new movie private life it opens in theaters and begin streaming Netflix this Friday she also co wrote the film adaptation of Nick ... novel Juliet, Naked which is currently in theaters\nAfter a break Marine Corps again will review the new memoir heartland about growing up just below the poverty line in a family that had been family farmers in rural Kansas I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "03"}
