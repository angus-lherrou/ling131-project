grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an Arab parent and the movement but here we now is racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties in a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Jared black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with Sasha ... this morning\nUSS low welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing you back to our program when I heard about the massacre the synagogue I thought about your book ... black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black\nIs still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull a trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find Don black story relevant to the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert Bowers\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and Don work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooter spotty yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight to white nationalist slogans fourteen refers to a fourteen word\nFor statement of purpose that is central forth storms like this about um it was securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children uh you know and and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch and why people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation to exist on store front and that's the way that they speak about this a quote unquote race for that they believe is under way\nYeah it was a I'm a ... hours had had said that um he believe the Jews were committing genocide against his people genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believed the Jews are committing genocide\nDoesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people on gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have\nThere is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab\nAnd I think the danger of a place like gab um and also the danger of of other social media networks is that it allows for people who already have these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and that was when he went on gab he saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially one long\nThat those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care of caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and wash my people get slaughtered and that's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nUm instilling front is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the sound your son\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere is some really vile I'm sort of celebration of what happens ah there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that's\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in in going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the\nPeople who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself but our our global is and that\nJews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect but every now and then somebody's going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either gone or guarantee black since the shooting at the Pentagon yesterday\nI've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and I think that he's heartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens\nHe feels in small ways culpable and he wanders um you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism plays into you know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and said to popular I think that in the movement said to them that somebody\nGoing to a synagogue and murder eleven people\nAnd leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself spread again and again on the ...\nW sea ice

shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Jared black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we now in seeing those views when he was twenty two\nHe helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included sassy though the first question was addressed to dark black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than\nWhite national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race is like in my pocket or evidence from white nationalism in so that was his thing\nHe didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy is being\nOne that you didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nCan't stay there for a second I've always wanted to know the early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream movement and make it more palatable\nOr whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not doing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult foot towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better um\nThe the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confidante way\nEssentially everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nThough they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult or they lay their clients to word um\nIs racial out all over the years if you look at the language in terms of how many people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively pursuing an end cause of separating or\nYou know races into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists\nMovement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures your based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it [noise]\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick

but um immigration was just going to out number white people in other countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or posting in the comments section and that quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people were making society worse\nGetting back to being attacked ... it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand that and American culture you know won't be ... quote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nA talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world I think it's an ...\nIdeology and point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races and to different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining there\nWas a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nUh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those was how do we wanted to find who is white because only a white person could be a member of storm front but there's no biological definition of white\nAnd so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and where something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually white by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader and Washington Post's reporting ...

friday\nThis is fresh air let's get back to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader who renounced his views when he was twenty to his father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter Eli fast slow the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred\nSo there are one of the things you did you have been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any belief outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book was a pretty liberal college in Florida there were Jewish people they're naturally tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must have publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's Derek Black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were you know very upset when I found out who you really are um you had your friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who dated if we didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nI I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew Shabaab dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart\nOf ... are not talking to me about it or I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested and did a and I think the\nOr was that it would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about\nSomething anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or die but his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from and it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where either this is this is crazy when you stop attacking Jewish people to back off\nIn addition to being the story of decks transformation I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was a civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who\nAh who won one is trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and\nSort of like point by point went through and and ah and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and\nAnd then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build a relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology\nMoshe ... in between these dinners which sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site and they would see the horrible things that he said about Jews and and ... yeah\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like\nThe awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe the Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and are are are sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist would define as the white race and\nSo ... had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case
