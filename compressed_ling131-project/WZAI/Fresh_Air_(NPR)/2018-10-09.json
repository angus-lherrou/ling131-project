a singer and songwriter who's album like a man when gold and Canada and twenty twelve he was born in Montreal in Nineteen Seventy two and I'm going to talk with us about Leonard Cohen as a writer performer and father and tell us about working closely with his father in the final year of his life\nLeonard Cohen is lyrics have adept few songwriters have achieved reflecting reverence and despair hid it traction to beauty and his knowledge of broken this lyrics informed by his Judaism his practice of Zen Buddhism and has dealt with\nSome of his many well known songs include Suzanne so long Marianne famously raincoat Chelsea hotel number two everybody knows power of song I'm your man and of course his best known most frequently recorded and performed song hallelujah\nAdam Cohen welcome to fresh air I just want to start by saying I Love your father's music I left his writing\nAnd I feel privileged to have had the chance to hear him in concert and to talk with him on her show and I'm grateful for the chance to talk with you today so thank you for being here when I interviewed her father and two thousand six after the publication of a book of his poems and songs\nHe asked to read a poem that he just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in his new book the flame so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of the home a street or from our two thousand six interview\nOr used to be your favorite drunk good for one more laugh\nThen we both wrote a look and look was always [laughter]\nYou put on a uniform to fight the civil war or tried to join but no one like size I'm voting for\nSo let's bring two women over ... sprint to when we moved all be waiting on this corner where they are used to be street\nWas an old uh

mysterious wind and the grace of the occasion there was an urgency to the entire mission and of course that had to do was a serious health issues she was a mobilized you had multiple compression fractures\nFederal monastic effort on his part to [noise] to be present to deliver the way he did but\n[noise] something about his work in general not just on the last album but in this book and in general [noise]\nHe he invites you into your own inner life because he takes the inner life seriously\nHe's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become misspell jacks during the ... because they're somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate in things whereas this man was speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard cons\nFinal lyrics homes no injuries and drawings and these are all collected in the new book the flame and Adam Cohen wrote the introduction to that we're going to take a short break and then I'll be right back this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of a late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard cons final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished and it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection and the ... collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this bones I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult the work with smaller steps\nKind of ... tone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes there was this really dark quality but\nThere was this like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcend in quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have and that that have his work as a life outside of his mouth\nAnd him and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room quietly reading his poems so I've always wanted to I Want to get on their record as saying you\nKnow and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and ah and exist the way songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry\nThat I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm a ... a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of people quietly thumbing through this book in observing and as I say really taking the time with\nTaking their own time not with my meter now with my voice well since you've declined to read more pounds that you find that I'm going to find out I'm not being ... cantankerous or in transit you\nKnow it's just it's it's I I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading and not another problem with is\nFrom the interview that we recorded in two thousand six and this is a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes in their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was kindly according to me even though I could barely

that is no way to say goodbye burn a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear it on what you do if you didn't meet me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs\nAnd singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nWhat's the sun and who's singing it um but but you were you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that sign writing was crafted something people actually did and you must have been like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course I heard them you know I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a horse is going out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the ... and then as I grew older\nThat was the complexities and the beautiful marsh\nAnd you grow older and then you then you sort of see how I remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for counsel I said dad you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nAnd we were sitting on the corner will ... and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record [noise] and uh was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and he was scrapped your record that's an amateur move\nSaid amateur move he says yeah\nIt's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel and at that moment I realized that um the love\nI had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but I was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that\nHe had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that ah\nThat baton off the ground [noise] do you and your parents separated um five six and ... that don't remember how much did you get to see us either after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of a union between two people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father\nWas able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me\nUm I my mother moved\nMy sister and I to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow our own whims and uh my father you know would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nHe'd always you always maintained\nA role um in in our lives despite my parents' separation\nThat I care about is like a mobile home\nLike what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nYeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to the south of France where we lived a\nAnd there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things and put it that the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of and\nHow is it that far\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and you know\nAs I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate this with which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own ways may be responsible for the revival of his career and for for\nUm his reconnection to people I'm ... around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing his soul to sell all the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] [noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry I'm an incredible that [laughter]\nThat would the canon of his work with his devotion to black cutting pages melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experienced this uh this episode that you're referring to is it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence made the heart grow fonder who knew\nI always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and others or\nBut it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal and lo and behold from this economic crisis a rose this most unexpected and\n[noise] festive of periods in his life oh essay festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\n[noise] the universities to suddenly started teaching his works I'm studying is works or even a whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics says liturgy um\nMadison Square garden and be able to you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being feel they have never sold more than six thousand tickets

know that social media have become a big tool in politics but you write in this book that it can affect not just opinions and reputations but the course of war and you cite a fascinating example a new rapid communications medium\nTransforming the military offensive is was the German invasion of France whatever\nSo you have this new technology that are connected everything from tanks to airplanes or to the broader population that was wireless communication\nAnd radio proved to be the secret sauce so to speak for everything from the political changes uh the rise of Nazi ism goals are said that it wouldn't have been possible what they did without the radio but it also Hodge strategic tactical military impact\nOr when the Germans invades France and invasion that most people didn't at the time I didn't think would work\nIt not only allows them to connect all their military units in a new manner allow him to coordinate and move faster than ever before but it also connected back into the enemy population\nI Believe it's tens of millions this is a gradually escalating process with a couple of different companies that are doing this piecemeal but it's the stated intent of the Chinese Communist party that this will be a unitary score in place for every Chinese internet user of which there about eight hundred million by the year twenty twenty\nThe other fascinating story you tell about China is they realize how commentary on social media can affect opinion and so they have ... and ...\nTo comment favorably on the government policies\nRight that's right and it is a very large army I started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of these are folks who are known as part of the the fifty cent army\nAnd their job uh and it it has its own training programs and I credit station systems their job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on we chat another Chinese platforms and

is fresh air and we're speaking with ... W singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign they were hip to the importance of this what did they do\nSo it was actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject originally and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUm this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign the campaign to twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual\nFew hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again in time or a mosque Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would put out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered then among us would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operate as these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies if one side or another ten million and all in this first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding\nWhose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out but importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals remaking battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nOriginally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects and like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nDoes that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a set of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means in the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cost and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist in an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can list and Taylor Swiss army of swift these you can enlist in the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cause may not be the same but the tactics are\nAnd by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you know giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one pulls from the world at a crowd sources so to speak\nAnd one of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and ... and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research this was woven into this battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes you would put rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of hijacking one discussion to drive it to your own ends the same way that ISIS for example\nWould hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's online army would try and hijack discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the

consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how a social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the Kavanaugh hearings in many ways that felt like a war going back and forth and\nUh it was in a certain way you had both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military were using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where ah they were enlisting\nThe online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nAnd it wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh too I unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket that\nThen you had the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor Ford or the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was now that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe spread of disinformation\nThe spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again and again you saw both sides engaging in this and the Kavanaugh debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona is in the like\nAnd the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative\nBe buried underneath as you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself for at least the on line place that we go to a stylish and learn about history we ... so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russian shoot down an airliner over you\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support WC ay ay Cape and islands dot org\nOr my I'm In is a high school yearbook that was sexual term and during his hearing he says no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about a drinking game the problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on ... do you make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kind of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they are now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nNeural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just men back but maybe in some ways surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um\nCreate a wonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world um and it's very powerful and use of ... for example or the future of marketing\nA it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the companies do this also as a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized\nI ... for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on a war\nA certain way to challenge also moves into visual imagery there's an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies and turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks are online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to say I ... back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nRight so so so these neural networks like would be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden honoring some you know profane a comment at something\nTo give real world examples of this there have already been creations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together\nWhere for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger to uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that to meld together to allow you to a in essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in this space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's gonna be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nEmerson Brooklyn ...
