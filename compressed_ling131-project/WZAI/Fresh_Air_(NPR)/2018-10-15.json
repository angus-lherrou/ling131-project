welcome to fresh air it is a pleasure to have you on our show so you started in comedy about eight years ago\nTen years they're near oh okay okay yeah so what\nWas the gender race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you and then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lot of straight white guys some women some people color feud queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um [noise]\nThat can be exhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me you\nKnow you're right that male comic stuff all the time about their body functions and their manned parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of you know men in the audience\n[noise] yeah I mean I think it just I just want to be clear that when anyone starts doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really sort of posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I've finally gotten to a place where I can occur is that allowed\nThey have to believe it's so so why bother\nI don't want to do that yet I don't want to I don't want to do it I'm not alone Wayne okay I'm not going to [laughter]\n\nAnother black girl\nMy great I think there was like one black girl in my class and there was one Indian girl and one Asian girl and I'm sure will be you know not to be like it's nice to have like a matching that but it would've been nice if we can of each like you know looked across you know during mass and saw someone else who looked like us [noise]\nWhenever we talk about like representation like diversity I don't think so\nYour stand how hard it is to not see yourself especially if you're living in society or culture where\nYou are so reflected at every possible turn I think it's hard to like um\nImagine what it's like to not have laughed and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a two to queens that would've been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like hey young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to like young black women talking about\nOh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair and like totally messed it up I couldn't talk about by black hair woes and high school with like Laura\nShe doesn't know she doesn't she just wakes up and she has ... ... like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK\nWith being out numbered in a way and not letting that make me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or you know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these\nSort of shows where you could still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like queen ... and be like oh okay cool so I could kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman [noise] you're right about\nBody image in your book and you say yeah since you were fourteen your brand has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning not attractive to straight dudes and for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even in age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so how have you tried to like overcome that because it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards mhm is at a different place\nThan you are just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or\nYou know I'm a writer was no other an analogies great moving on [laughter] but you know

your amazing and then that would make me realize I'm amazing and then we have this happy life together\nAnd so that was one of the biggest lessons was like not looking for this great relationship to sort of define me or make me realize that I'm lovable I just had to sort of figure that out for myself and be OK if\nI don't date someone for two years or two and a half years or five years and if I haven't like found my soul mate on my partner by then does that mean that I'm a terrible person you know what I mean it's like all these like value systems you like placed on yourself and it was all predicated on what someone else thought about me never watched that checking to see how I felt about myself\nDid you have to learn how to a fully enjoy yourself when you were not with somebody whether it's going to go into a movie by herself or having dinner by herself [noise] um I just feel like I'm consuming this I'm watching this and I don't need somebody with me to fully appreciate the experience\nAbsolutely I mean I I did all that stuff where I just and you always think like you go out to like a diner or a movie go by yourself and you think everyone is just like dropping like

tells us that the old master has recently died\nWashes now standing to attention as a carriage carrying his new master arrives he's a pale sinister looking man named Erasmus wild\nLooking at him wash comments he owned me as he owned all those I Lived among not only our lives but also our debts and that pleased him too much\nReaders will naturally anticipate that a tale of brutalities small moments of grace and for did escape attempts will follow except that's not quite what happens in short order to escape attempts here are successful\nWash breaks away from that plantation the hot air balloon no less and ... also breaks away in her case leaving behind the confines of the conventional his\nSporting readers into the ... the realms of romantic era travelogue and scientific exploration\nIn Washington Black ... has created a wonder of an adventure story powered by the helium of fantasy but also by the tender sensibility of its aspiring young hero wash black\nLet's backtrack a second to that opening scene at the plantation the new master\nIs not the only white men who stepped down from that carriage his younger brother Christopher wild nicknamed pitch also all lights\nHe turns out to be a rather decent man of science who's brought along the materials to assemble what he calls a cloud cutter\nA hot air balloon attached to a boat like gone to law\nPitch and lifts wash as his assistant teaching him to read and in the process discovering that washed possesses a skill for executing detailed scientific drawings\nAcross the color line the to strike up a kind of friendship\nSo much so that when it seems likely that watch will be killed in wrongful retaliation for the death of a white visitor to the plantation\nKitsch fires up the gas canister cuts the ropes that tether the cloud cover ... earth and together the to ascend into attempt pest you as nighttime sky\nI began to cry recalls wash thinking of this extraordinary moment\nThe air group colder correct in webs of cross my skin all was shadow red lights storm fire and frenzy and up we went into the eye of it untouched miraculous\nIf only that escape or the soaring conclusion to wash his adventures not just the beginning\nBut inevitably the friends attempt to float above the consequences of race springs a leak and their balloon comes crashing down too hard historical realities\nA multitude of plot twists in Sioux taking first washing pitch and then wash alone to the Arctic Nova Scotia London and even to the bottom of the sea\nCertainly much of the pleasure of reading Washington Black derives from ...\nBut her novel is more than just a boy in bobble washes weighted down throughout his travels by the burden some question of identity for one thing he can never predict how other characters whether they be black or white will see him\nThe prize scientific education he received from ... elevates wash but also makes him a curiosity much like the solitary little orange octopus he captures on his underwater dive to later exhibits\nWash resolutely places his faith in science to advance human enlightenment but midway through the novel he experiences a harsh awakening\nI had long seen science as the great equalizer wash says no matter one's race or sex or faith there were facts in the world waiting to be discovered how little thought I'd give in to the ways in which it might be corrupted by human beings\nWashington Black is an unconventional and often touching novel about the search for transcendence above categories as she tries to do for her hero watch and see huge and clearly aims to carry her readers up up and away\nMarine car again teaches literature at Georgetown University she reviewed Washington Black by se ... and now they're going to hear an interview with ... and she's a

here\nUm the plantation of your novels in Barbados as I gather you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\n[noise] you know I'm not I'm not a ... a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers\nSo the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher [noise] the ah the conditions and circumstances of slaves lives were much more dire and I'm ... you know quite ... to have to to do that research but I'm very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a is George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash\nAnd he's a field work around the plantation but one day he gets a call to go serve the that the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild it goes by church there's a lotta nicknames and uh he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he request that wash his assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight he's as for ... for the balloon\nUm and it's a moment the changes washes live forever because a bond forms between him and this was white man to watch\n'em and teach will eventually help wash the skate but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change in this and this boy's life and not arbitrariness forever Hans wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as\nYou know being helpful to his experiments in that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand his arrows stat or which is you know kind of a cruelty and itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington really um surprises him\nWith his natural gifts like he has no\nNo idea you know that this this young man it's just completely you just don't naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a good sense for 'em or nautical methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under ... [noise]\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore a ... character is you know although he's an extremely liberal minded men for his time\nAh you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is and a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions a\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very general belief in the rights of men it's kind of a prescribed\nIn this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nRight in his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get to heaven as they allow sort of cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this is kind of central to his\nA philosophy or about life but you know having said that he is somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to feel a great affection for Washington and so there's that dichotomy and his personality that's so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash a scrapes from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives on him you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how fear that people complicit in slid the slave economy", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "15"}
