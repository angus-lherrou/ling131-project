it's a series of funny conversational personal essays on subjects including being a feminist nearly getting a victim when she was going broke trying to make it as a comic\nGoing from a four year relationship to being single again and then being in a relationship again\nAnd what it's been like as a black woman to be an interracial relationships\nPhoebe Robinson welcome to fresh air and it's a pleasure to have you on our show so you started in comedy about eight years ago ten years they're near okay okay I Know what was the gender race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lot of straight white guys some women some people color a few where people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um [noise]\nThat can be exhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their manned parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of you know men in the audience\n[noise] yeah I mean I think it just I just want to be clear that went anyone started doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really started posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I've finally gotten to a place where I can ... is that allowed now have to believe it's oh so why bother I don't want to do that yet I don't want to I don't want to do it I'm not alone Wayne okay I'm not going to [laughter]\nI think you and I think it was worth it I Will say it would have been nice if there was another black girl\nAnd my great I think there was like one black girl in my class and there was one Indian girl and one Asian girl and I'm sure we you know not to be like it's nice to have like a matching that but it would've been nice if we can if each like you don't look to cross\nElse who look like us whenever we talk about like representation like diversity I don't think sometimes people fully understand\nHow hard it is to not see yourself especially if you're living in society or culture where you are so reflected at every possible turn I think it's hard to like um\nImagine what it's like to not have left and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a to do queens that would've been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like hey young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to like young black women talking about oh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair and like totally like messed it up\nI couldn't talk about by black hair woes and high school with like Laura she doesn't know she's a she's just wakes up and she has ... ... ... ... like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work I myself I did have to kind of like be OK with being out\nNumbered in a way and not letting that makes me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or you know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows\nWhere you can still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like queen ... and be like oh okay cool so I can kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman [noise] you're right about\nBody image in your book and you say yeah since you were fourteen your brand has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning for not attractive to straight dudes and for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even in age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so how have you tried to like overcome that because it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place\nThan you are just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know\nOh jeeze great moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still makes that self dot com and so I think what I have done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising\nBut not like I don't have a scale in a house and make it is not about a number\nIf you're just going like I Need to make sure I'm strong enough to get through the day rather than I I Want to make sure I look and nice pair of jeans\nI feel more powerful the little bit of experiences that have gotten with like styling and doing like these photo shoots and again these are champagne problems I just went up ... I Know that but there there'll be like oh yeah we have a size four and it's like that is unacceptable to me\nTo only have a size four is truly ignorant and inexcusable or I go to these like shoots and I tell people\nI'm a ten twelve that's just what it is and there'll be like here's a six it's like how dare you\nSurely it's like how dare you be like oh we'll be couldn't find anything in your size you didn't look 'cause I dressed myself every day I dress myself every day and I find everything I Need\nThis sort of oh well we only have a zero to force you either ... or you're you're screwed is not how you should treat anybody I Would do these video games and Ninety percent of the stuff I wouldn't fit into and every time I didn't fit in something I Believe I'm Sorry\nAnd it'd be a pilot Hi I Would apologize after every single ... I'm so sorry and I'm like they knew what size I was four weeks before I showed up\nI is not my fault I'm decides that I Am\n[noise] there's an afterword and it didn't come to your book and part of

amazing and then that would make me realize I'm amazing and then we have this happy life together and so\nThat was one of the biggest lessons was like not\nLooking for this great relationship to sort of define me or make me realize that I'm lovable I just had to sort of figure that out for myself and be OK\nIf I don't date someone for two years or two and a half years or five years and if I haven't like found my soul mate on my partner by then does that mean that I'm a terrible person you know what I mean it's like all these like value systems you like placed on yourself\nAnd it was all predicated on what someone else thought about me never once they check and see how I felt about myself\nDid you have to learn how to a fully enjoy yourself when you were not with somebody whether it's going to go into a movie by herself or having dinner by herself [noise] um I just feel like I'm consuming this I'm watching this and I don't need somebody with me to fully appreciate the experience\nAbsolutely I mean I I did all that stuff where I just and you know you always think like you go out to like a diner or a movie go by yourself and you think everyone is just like dropping like you're at a restaurant everyone's dropping therefore ... there is a woman [laughter] singled out by herself\nAin't nobody they're all like focus on their ... they are not thinking about you you

and transporting readers into the ... the realms of romantic era travelogue and scientific exploration\nIn Washington Black ... has created a wonder of an adventure story powered by the helium a fantasy but also by the tender sensibility of its aspiring young hero wash black\nLet's backtrack a second to that opening scene at the plantation\nThe new master is not the only white men who steps down from that carriage\nHis younger brother Christopher wild nicknamed pitch also a lights he turns out to be a rather decent man of science who's brought along the materials to assemble what he calls a cloud cutter a hot air balloon attached to a boat like gone to law\nPitch and lifts wash as his assistant teaching him to read and in the process discovering that washed possesses a skill for

of a white visitor to the plantation\nTeach fires up the gas canister cuts the ropes that tether the cloud cutter to earth and together the to ascend into attempt pest you as nighttime sky\nI began to cry recalls wash thinking of this extraordinary moment\nThe air group colder crept in webs across my skin all was shadow red light storm fire and frenzy and up we went into the eye of it untouched

and their balloon comes crashing down too hard historical realities\nA multitude of plot twists in Sioux taking first washing pitch and then wash alone to the Arctic Nova Scotia London and even to the bottom of the sea\nIn Washington Black derives from ... ingenious storytelling gifts but her novel is more than just a boy and bobble\nWashes weighted down throughout his travels by the burden some question of identity for one thing he can never predict how other characters whether they be black or white will see him\nThe prize scientific education he received from hitch elevates watch but also makes him a curiosity much like the solitary little orange octopus he captures on his underwater dive to leader exhibit\nWash resolutely places his faith in science to advance human enlightenment but midway through the novel he experiences a harsh awakening\nI had long seen science is the great equalizer wash says no matter one's race or sex or faith there were facts in the world waiting to be discovered how little thought I'd give in to the ways in which it might be corrupted by human beings\nWashington Black is an unconventional and often touching novel about the search for transcendence

work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\nYou know I'm not I'm not a ... a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise] this is kind of an ironic\nW UCI sustaining members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nThe conditions and circumstances of slaves lives were much more dire and on the you know quite ... to have to to do that research but I'm very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a is George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash\nAnd he's a field work around this plantation but one day he gets a call to go serve the at the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild who goes by ... there's a lot of nicknames and ah he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested washed because assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight he's as for ... for the balloon\nUm and it's a moment the changes wash his life forever because a bond forms between him and this this white man pitch\n'em and teach will eventually help wash a scape but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change in this and this boy's life and not arbitrariness forever Hans wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as\nBeing helpful to his experiments in that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand is arrows dodged a which is you know kind of a cruelty and itself to to look at somebody and I think out of them but then Washington really um surprises him\nWith his natural gifts like he has no\nNo idea you know that this this young men is just completely you know naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a good sense for 'em or an article methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under pitch\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore and ... character is you know although he's an extremely liberal minded men for his time\nAh you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions a\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly hasn't\nBelief in the rights of men it's kind of over prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nRight in his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get to heaven if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this is central to his\nA philosophy or about life but you know having said that he somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to the great affection for Washington and so there's that dichotomy in his personality that's so interesting to me\nSo they'll washes scrapes from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives on him you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how

have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought you should talk about your problems I mean I'm\nA therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help a distant ties you seeing someone was talking to somebody\nOr on a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because I I\nCatch books and and in my drawings\nWhen you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nOh he was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I'd get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learn\nAnd and by that what he meant was I mean that that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles this is how you have to think\nAnd so she as an as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally and in that moment ah and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did but that's not what did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics that that was actually useful for you\nIs certainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know at the the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but\nNot right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um\nYou know there's still a lot of value on that book and I still have the book um but in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know [laughter] real one is just have your own style [laughter] donating you ignore everything about [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hey

and then he died and then she started hanging out with these other people I just knew it was going to be a downward spiral and\nWhen I saw her at a book event of mine um she she had all of his track marks on the back of her hand on her arm and she she blamed on the dog jumping up on her but I just knew my heart I knew and ah surely after my second child was born\nA this was December of two thousand and eleven she started getting arrested again and so in January of two thousand twelve\nHolly who is who she is my ... by lineage but my sister or by heart and soul called me on the phone and she said did you see the paper today\nAs a hobby I live in North Hampton I live in our ... no I didn't see the paper what happened and uh my mother was arrested for expressing false prescriptions at at pharmacies and I I went in person to talk to my mother had of her court date and she she has she assured me that she was\nNot using she was just selling it to a guy to make extra money I said well that's really not going to convince me to bring my kids around here and I really had to put some distance between us at that point you know why I had a three year old a newborn and they needed their dad and I needed\nMy children and uh and so yeah there was the way I Would keep track of her she would she would get arrested 'em and they get arrested for driving without a license or or or you know she would be driving and the police officer tried to pull her over and she would try to outrun than\nShe did spend a little bit of time in jail again ah the last time I saw her was that a family funeral\nAnd that this was this would have been in spring of two thousand six team and we had a we had a nice connection you know and she said I Love you and I always will and I said mom I Love you and I always will and you know you do I would worry I'd wake up in the middle of the night thinking\nWhat if what if I'm wrong what if she really isn't using you know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people just she wasn't making herself accessible to me\nAnd you know I was she knew I was writing what would become hate kiddo and I was getting to the point where I thought you know I'm a long in Detroit process from really going to need to talk to her about what I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym stand him\nAnd I received a phone call one night it was march of two thousand Seventeen at the end of the month\nAnd it was her it was her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd already on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family\nAnd on Monday morning I went into the funeral home in Stephen who's got the again he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother met me there [noise] and and I really had the feeling of you know she's going to be cremated I don't want to see her one more time\nAnd and the FEMA director pointed out like ... you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the more to the funeral home [noise]\nSo I said you know what well let's let's have a viewing and I had in my mind that she would worth address ... to to my wedding and so I had in my mind that I Would just turn up at her house I would open the closet and sure enough there would be the dress\nAnd Steven accompany me and now it's in the afternoon and ah there's a man in the house then she she had claimed that was response or [noise]\nHave a sponsor of the opposite sex I'm On a certain wouldn't be living with you so later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so\nHe opened the door and uh he was just completely out of his mind I mean he was high on heroin his eyes were blood red his skin was white as bone he had a T shirt sweat pants no no socks for shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute\nAnd I'm Still ... tunnel vision that I Want to see my mom and make my mom beautiful again that I entered the house\nAnd um went to her bedroom couldn't find couldn't find the dress tonight my my my Lance went over to her bureau\nAnd it was just filled with ugliness it was filled with metal spoons and turning kits and and all all of her drug paraphernalia\nAnd so her boyfriend at the time said oh you know what there's a there's a cedar closet and this other room right now of course a dress that was that important to her she would preserve and the cedar closet\nSo I ... I stepped in the other room where the cedar closet is [noise] and on a little nicer than I saw him down and then on the ... air I saw three handguns in next so that was to handguns and now I'm realizing I'm On a room filled with handguns with my back\nTo someone who's high on heroin and I said this is exactly why I didn't come to visit my mom these last two years because this is exactly what I figured I'd step into so now I'm thinking what if I'd done\nWhat if I die here my children need me\nSo I I made the boyfriend like I just need to be alone with my mother's things could you just give me a moment so he he moved\nAnd you know as loud as I could I said well Steve and you know the the dresses in here I'm just going to go to Macy's and uh by her address me and he just looked at I mean he's like you sure we can keep looking at the conference catcher [laughter]\nVery quickly I said okay I Need to get my baby albums I Need to get this photo album an okay here's this painting I made for her ... as quickly as I could grabbing handfuls of things I wanted to hold onto in the event that the house blew up the next day\nUm wow and so now I'm I'm making preparations for mothers memorial and we didn't publicize the memorial I didn't put in the newspaper till afterwards but now I'm really fearful this guy's going to turn up with with guns and so I hired security\nBut in the interim between that moment and and the memorial that boyfriend was arrested\nThis is my mother Leslie Chris Oscar she turns up to not let the children leave with her\nAnd I must have really hurt you have to leave that instruction it\nDid it did and um you know there were moments where we had a game plan where if my mother was a turn up at our doorstep unannounced or my wife would take the children upstairs lock the door and I would call the police just to have on hand in case something bad happened [noise] you\nKnow when when you're writing from the point of view as a child and your graphic memoir hate you know you you can find your mother and said to her you chose drugs over me mhm how do you see it now as an adult\nHow having seen the fact that she couldn't help herself to the very and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Brewster", "day": "16"}
