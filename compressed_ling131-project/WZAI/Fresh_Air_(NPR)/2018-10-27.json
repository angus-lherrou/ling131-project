Curtis is the author of a biography of Lou Reed which just came out in paperback\nCurtis is a contributing editor for Rolling Stone where he's written for more than thirty five years to Curtis new read and considered him a friend although not a close one\nAs part of his research your Curtis interviewed many people read new including his first two wives Lou Reed cofounded the velvet underground which he played with from Nineteen sixty four to Nineteen Seventy\nThe band was initially managed by Andy Warhol and was part of Warhol seen on many bands of the time or singing about peace love and losing the Gen x Lou Reed was writing songs about heroin street hustler and transcripts of sexuality he continued in that direction as a solo artist\nBut he also wrote sons that had a spiritual quality to Curtis says other than Bob Dylan the Beatles and James Brown no one has exerted as great an influence on popular music as Reid has\nRead died of liver disease five years ago at the age of Seventy one\nThe Curtis says he wouldn't have written this book well read was alive quote this book does not at all times see Lou the way he wanted to see himself\nAspects of their sex life had drug use and is cruelty that he came to be embarrassed about our discussion here in detail as our his generosity and his kindness his talent his vision and his genius unquote\nWe recorded the interview last November when the book was first published and started with the song heroin from the velvet underground first album\n\nI\nMean when\n\nWe try\n\n\n\n\nTells you oh our parents were were\nSo that so it wasn't about their fear of him being gay but I was thinking like everybody was on the phone that can\nWell that's right and that's the thing I don't think they were more homo phobic than that you know they were just kind of a conventional suburban couple Louis bringing into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved in the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\nEden of peace and you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to gay bars and acting out\nAs a gay person you know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nWe mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I\nWell yeah that's true and that and there are people I mean this was a really I mean it it's a very it's an issue very much at the moment interestingly because I'm kind of gone around the block\nSee anything he was on like fluid in his actual alley yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's ah describes him as inter\nAnd [laughter] it's a kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of flu but he was really gay and the other day I got one of those and it was you know as a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends\nShe was saying look there's no way Louis gay\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you gauge the adage you saw what you wanted to see you know and I I think Lou was kind of open to going wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for it then\nWell that's right they didn't that language didn't exist [noise]\nYes I did one guy I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that but when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI have a price on Iran or exactly yeah\nKnow and and ah I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap introducing ... everyone to spend money we were living in these all of these small places he would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took lose story as\nSaid well with his father ever given a money issue of course he would have given him money you know if it's anything for a living you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what\nLose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever Lou needed anything he was there and you know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seem\nAnother thing that really like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own you didn't have any money not eat set so he got a job working for his father typing in his father's accounting office yes extending transgression of is that [laughter] I'm\nNot totally I Know he's ... and he always would say because you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to buy time in making money and if they were they were ... yeah exactly yeah\nSomebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City um\nThat his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get that confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately\nAnd you know they kind of relationship\nThat was a you know along with\nA you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names that was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize them in song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl but ah yeah but in real life you know we got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of have yet to kind of expand his his his his reach 'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol\nWell that's yeah that's very interesting question because you know um [noise] yeah ... ... ah Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular and you know I'm just going to make some movies now and you know and says like we should have a band you know rock and roll is getting to be a thing and\nSo they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know and you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for Andy\nI'm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio\nDecided that the the velvet underground we're kind of too boring looking so they got Nico yeah who is a you know a German model an actress and soon to be finger to you know to be their lead singer Lewis not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of disability\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with that he limited Nico was participation as much as he could you know um she only saying you know a few songs\nOr the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band and as soon as he could he got ... you know he kick Nico has the band as well after having an affair with her\nAnd well that's very true [laughter] exactly it was you know part of those times\nUm and that was a you know so that was one of the issues of Warhol a Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time war who was in the newspapers all the time they're not\n... you know not art critics reading about it although that too but it's just like a this crazy guy you know he thinks they're Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspapers do whatever he did got attention and ah you know Lou took advantage of that\nBut that also hurt the velvet underground in that\nYou know rock and roll certainly back then was a pretty Ernest thing and the Warhol seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a band you know for for people who had entered them yet you know in her novel amazing now so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think Lou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to\nMore special operations you know there's no way or the world was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nMy guess is Anthony to Curtis the author of the book Lou Reed uh life it's just been published in paperback after a break we'll talk about ...

I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about [noise]\n\nHolly came from Miami ... Fitch hyped away and crawl on us they loved her eyebrows on the way to shave their legs and then he was uh she she says the the\n... and said hey honey they could walk on the ... uh [noise]\n\nCandy came from\nActually read walk on the outside his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie\nI'm so that so that was actually a head friendly lead but it's not I\nSo badly finally has run and he sounds like it was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where you know there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible they're good to be a rock band and have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know [laughter] more than more going to go to Adam ... yeah yeah precisely\nAnd even if you did have heads [laughter] you know you got a year or two and then you went home but\nUm you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as wanted to do serious things and\nAnd take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got to hit like now let's do take another walk on the wall side or walk on the wall side again and you know that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nA you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh and lying eyes but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing record 'em\nSo you know he would turn on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once he had destroyed his dad you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album and a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career was just an hour of just\nYou know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that was unthinkable before Lou did it\nAnd I'm just I didn't want that he wanted to have is music reach people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nExactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter]\nHonestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um\nSo um [noise]\nW CI

with Rachel which was a huge it's documented quite movingly or in the song street hostile apart called slip away where you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview and you know at that time you know said\nYou know that was real she did that I mean essentially you know saying like Rachel they'll stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise]\nUm I think they had been falling apart there's some lots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of\nI'm Rachel wanting to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met\nI'm Sylvia morale is who became his second wife and you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was\nUm [noise] you know over the course of two or three years Luke got clean\nA got straight and um [noise] and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways the song like Halloween parade or a you know there will be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be he also turned on it and are\nOften not with that you know that much um\n[noise] bitterness but uh but still we would never discuss\nIt [noise] you know so I I Want to play a different accept at St hassle and not to slip away part that you referred to sure whether by this about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person
