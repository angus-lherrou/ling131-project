Blacksburg who's also the show runner seasons five is now a net flicks Comedy Central is now showing the first season\nThe series satirized as Hollywood and deals with issues like success and failure ego power addiction relationships and sexism season five is set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that's a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics bow jak is a horse and became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBut when season one above jak horsemen begins bow jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and he spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of his sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then\nLet's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on the Charlie Rose show\n[noise] in Nineteen Ninety ... situation comedy ocean around me or don't ABC Show which young bachelor horses forced to reevaluate its priorities we agreed to raise three human children\nWas initially dismissed by critics is wrong and suffering and not good but the family comedy struggled with America when on the air for nine seasons starts horses around ... ...\nIt is good to be your Charlie [laughter]\nRaphael blah Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter] you know we were you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be\nExcused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode one the women step forward\nReally dates the show doesn't it of Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know we'll get bow jak through such a mess and all of Fargo and unprofessional and Charlie Rose up ... by ... is our our straight person in the scene\nAnd when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause there wasn't it was truly oh no\nAll the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it is interesting now to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nAnd you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some fun surprising ways\nI liked that sneak attack into sadness instead and some fun ways [laughter] far north as quick as it kind of sadness I like the final version [laughter] and and oh jak\nIsn't such despair afterwards and feels so responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWell let's say it's a lazy suicide attempt right if a suicide attempt a plausible deniability like he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a parking but maybe minor distinction to us that he was so disappointed and despairing but he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\n[noise] one of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one long monologue bow jocks mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her\nSo he's at a podium at a Mike her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happen in the family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a ... part of his eulogy and this is will earn that as Beau jak horsemen\nAre used to be on the TV show called horse around fiercely they'll hold your applause\nWell held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named ...\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network at a note maybe don't mention they're orphans so much because audiences tend to fight orphans sad and not related at all what I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they couldn't imagine their parents to be anything they wanted they had something to lung for\nAny way we did this one season finale we're Libya's birth mother comes to to she was a junkie but she's got her so cleaned up and ...\nShe's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted anyway the horse to water be careful moms have a way of letting you do but Libya just thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moved to California Olivia decides to go with her\nThe network really juiced the cliffhanger is Olivia gone for good\nBut of course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. alpha the cast stop of course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not handled Libya on the show\nYou can't have happy endings sitcoms not really because if everyone's happy to show would be over and above all else the show\nHas to keep going there's always more show and you can call horse in the round dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broke and your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that\nI'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip that um he ended our our fans because they can't imagine their parents anyway they wanted to um what made you think about that [noise]\nYou know I I I think a big part of this episode and a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but is gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think\nWhat's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe on a personal level level that nobody is era deem a ball or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven\nWhere I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've hurt so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption and I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a ... a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement with so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the the richer you you and the writers is do we forgive you award you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe forgive ease the we for\nSure but we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a\nWe forgive you award from I think for time forgiving recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger and\nIt one of the sad\nSlash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is\nThat our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and they're able to kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized that and then over the course of the last year\nIt started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just in the last month or so it started to feel like\nOh no wait maybe more forgiving\nI don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years\nWhat makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers and I I don't know if we have we forgotten\nHis anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her his use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this era that we're in\nAccountable but it still feels like we are not you know where we see carry a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation a there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is ...

S. um tell me about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of\nUh so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob\nAnd it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area and so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish day school um you know I even after\nA high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt or extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never once felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of minorities that were chips um we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that says happy Halloween because it's missing an end so we have the the misfit toys or Monica um\nIt it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWith the disconnect between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture a hundred\nIt felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power\nAnd there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me um but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening um especially big some for someone who you know as\nA Jew you hear the story of the Holocaust over and over and over growing up\nAnd the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing\nThem and cutting off their beards and so it's\nLot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know especially one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey set up because it's the ... and like I think yeah\nAnd I and I would say a couple of years ago to be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was a difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes\nYou know I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that\nAnd I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested in me I\nCould focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in and there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave and\nYou know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time\nThat I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I Love the audience that I Love making people laugh but a lot of it too is I I\nHad trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize was inappropriate\nKnow like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here watching the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take um\nShelling out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's\nA ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it and I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [noise]\nWell I think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other\nMental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps in what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space for you or you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that\nIs that like there's so many pop culture references and bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nUm said made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nWell TV made sense to me and you know there is a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary\nAudience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this seem that I was living in feel like the scenes that we're seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful as being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold on to this and all I have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think of the funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting into the story later so having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is is running bulge application Netflix series now the comedy central is rain yet starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you to ask you in retrospect like some of the jokes in season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks and make sure there are the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to keep their\nDignity as an episode of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this scene work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but I also think look this is the show and\nIt has to exist on its own terms and\nHopefully people you know as they have embraced the showing Netflix will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will see those flaws what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nYou're listening to the Cape and islands NPR stations or service of W Judy edge on line at ... dot org [noise]\nYou're listening to WBAI your local news and information source for the keep the coast and the island's Ninety point one WBAI WC a I H ...

more than anything else offers\nReaders now based on their actual facts I'm embarrassed for actual documents an entirely new financial ...\nLet me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David Barstow of the New York times who wrote or a remarkable investigative piece on a President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how\nDonald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air\nAmara glass on this American Life we bring you report from the world's most dangerous battlefields\nPinching your cheek right now pressure pointing actually like the back seat in the family car um three brothers was the oldest in the middle and basically on the mediator\nHow do you mean [noise]\nI haven't actually not ... I mean I just don't like saying that many stories of don't sit in the daily news shows this American Life Saturday morning at eleven Sunday United sick\nFor a WBAI\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter says and crab and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches\nFrom his father and it deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how is a self\nMade millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred from Donald's father funneled to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man\nBy the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about\nI'm Fred Trump made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that you got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas into his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\nAh we remove document and real dollars sixty million dollars in\nIn today's dollars acquaintance two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw it I think what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never really paid you know he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month he's going back to dad him he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw\nEspecially that the flow of loans increase as Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you'd run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he is the money for\nMany of his adventures he had Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars um\nIn debt in the ... the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to the father of these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ...\nCould also see that when he fell and then when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety net was there to catch them\nOne spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the story and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time and the you know the back end of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy and Fred Trump had been there for him\nAnd see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nInfrared Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money ... million dollars worth of it was ... and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and knew well\nAnd it was caught a soldier the will is taken to Fred Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor for Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary on Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move it's an incredibly dramatic move and\nScarring to the family what he did\n[laughter] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life were toward the end of ... live\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and Fred tromp Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had help with so much money over so many years\n... what we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this is an attempt by his um to gain\nComplete control over his estate and potentially to use\nThe the the empire that Fred Trump doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess they're New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne crab after our break we'll talk about another skiing used to transfer of wealth from Fred ... real estate and\nGross and this is fresh

Frank comments don't own at this time of his death out there last include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included both of buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer name or be shown in the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through that dot sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that that empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much laugh\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that down Donald Trump me it definitely wasn't so the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with it so it's true that you are us actually did perform some audits\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nA few million more bucks on this returning from a few million more bucks on that return\nBut the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families who are the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated uh maneuvers to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking though at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of simply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just in a state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of India the art of the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all is actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the shell based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nUnpopular\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David [noise] out of a comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nAh well said he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse\nAnd through his grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book so happens to coincide with the time when\nYou actually took possession of one quarter of his father's real estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's\nHis daring do of cutting himself off the ... it actually cause it's perfectly when the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback I'm also thinking\nOf immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money might\nNot happen in two thousand and four I'm right is the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watch that opening scene it's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane as their ... the gold tower in\nMidtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that fried shrimp built and paid for [noise] I'm Wondering\nHow you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities and so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward\nIn that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've reset thought I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first step in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents off I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's hard to refute because it's I'm absolutely true in the documents are there in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on this story and all the documents that you drew\nWe're locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it who was allowed\nTo go you know [laughter] we uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter] out of it but we uh yeah it was uh just\nThe three of us for a year um with a yeah that's a pretty messy [laughter] I was a little road than there are\nA little ... too I Would imagine [laughter] than other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise] um actually people\nKnew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it a kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "18"}
