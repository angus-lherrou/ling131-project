successful presidential campaign were based on his image as a brilliant dealmaker and self made billionaire the recent New York times\nNarrative it's based on a trove of more than a hundred thousand pages of documents including confidential tax returns and financial records given to the times by a secret source\nThe documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars from his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump a millionaire by the time Donald was eight\nOver the years Donald received today's equivalent of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of his money was transferred from father to son with\nThe help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which according to my guess or outright fraud Suzanne crab and David Barstow or to other reporters at the New York times who\nWrote a long investigative article about the many tax maneuvers Fred Trump devised to pass his vast fortune onto his children does and Craig writes about the intersection of politics money and government for the times David Barstow has won three Pulitzer Prizes\nIn response to their reporting a lawyer for President Trump provided a written statement saying quote there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times bases it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate unquote\nBut neither the president or his lawyers disputed any of the specifics in the times financial reporting\nOn crack David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here give us a sense of Fred from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak\nFor Trump was a remarkable builder and in New York's history he was\nA guy who who build and sold his first home before you reach the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes your mother told me he was in his mid forties she was really the biggest developers are treated in the country and what he specialized in was building middle class ... whose homes which he built in his apartment buildings which rebuild and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens we're kind of lose no frills homes that he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the the Henry Ford [laughter] um\nTelling of his story the famous line that he is always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father\nHad to pay back with interest and then he parlay that million dollar loan into a ten billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly you know to make themselves a celebrity\nBut we will be jumping on very a way to win win the presidency and so this story really by sex that narrative was more than anything else offers\nReaders now based on the actual facts um ... actual documents an entirely new financial ...\nLet me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David Barstow of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on\nA President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans he got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had and that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how\nDonald Trump engaged and suspect tax games as he reaped riches from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter says and crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as\nA self made millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father funneled to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man\nBy the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about\nI'm Fred Trump made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that you got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlayed that into his into his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump in loans\nAh we were able to document and real dollars\nAnd it's not one million I'm In today's dollars equates two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw it I think what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month he's going back to that and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw\nEspecially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in his early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he used the money for\nMany of his adventures he had Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars\nIn debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to the father of these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ...\nCould also see that when he fell you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety net was there to catch them\nOne spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the story and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time and the you know the back end of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy and ...\nReturn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment and Fred Trump as a lawyer\nI'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money to spend a million dollars worth of it was a chat room and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and do well\nAnd it was caught a soldier the will is taken to Fred Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire into potentially put at risk\nAnd ... immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor for Trump's well inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump\nIn charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life after all his father has done for him that he makes this move it's incredibly dramatic move and\nLike scarring to the family what he did\n[noise] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump down himself out and Fred tromp Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many are\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this is an attempt by his um to Jane\nComplete control over his estate and potentially to use\nThe the the empire that Fred Trump doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow ensues and crab after our break we'll talk about

that's progressive\nFresh air let's get back to my interview with New York times reporters says and crack and David Barstow who along with Russ Buettner published a long investigative article this month but ... schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump measured in ...\nFour hundred Thirteen million so then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision so\nThe interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting\nAnd they had regular family meetings after fried Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo still the the the uh buildings that were sold all of those buildings ... own at this time of his dad though they're awesome clued all the buildings that had been transferred from ... to the children\nThey included both of buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it's sold them you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer named ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through that thought sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that not empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that down and Donald Trump made it definitely wasn't so the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all we actually didn't completely get away with it so it's\nPerform some audits on some of the tax returns that we describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did\nPush back some and especially on the lower valuations they placed on buildings made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning if ... million more bucks on that return\nBut the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families who are\nThe most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated uh maneuvers to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking though at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of simply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just an estate tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the art of the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all is actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the shell based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nUnpopular\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David out of a comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nAh well said he publishes the or the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse\nAnd through his grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book so happens to coincide with the time when you actually took possession\nOf one quarter of his father's real estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that\nThis moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually cause it's perfectly when the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback I'm also thinking\nOf immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice in the song money money money might\nNot happen in two thousand and four I'm right is the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump built and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities\nAnd so many people still believe the mess and Donald Trump is still putting forward in that it's interesting when I think about\nThat I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken that I think a good first step in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's I'm absolutely true in the documents were there and a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nMentioned that you drew from that you got access to wear locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it who is allowed to [laughter]\nWe uh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in to one day with a with a little documents and [laughter]\nIt but we uh yeah it was uh just the three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy look a little ...\nLittle ... imagine [laughter] other people now are you were locked up in this room [noise] um actually people\nKnew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding we kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know these people keep asking you what you're up to 'em but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could well\nDrag into our dinosaurs [noise] so I kinda have what I Want it now that I'm grown up I have my own flock of\nDinosaurs [noise] you're listening to the Cape and islands NPR station [noise] Mm [noise]\nMm\n[noise] you're listening to Ninety point one double you ca I ended up all you see a H.

he became this coast a sort of coming in and out of the house I mean physically he changed you know he lost your skin and bugs and he was\n[noise] I I think one of the things that you both had trouble with\nIn the rehab programs was called God talk you know in the alcoholics anonymous model\nYou look toward a higher power to give you strains and there's a saying that goes let go and let God David you describe in your memoir how\nYou you you were er\nAnd raised in it without religion um did you know I too\nI too felt guilty I mean that you asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for that too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is to embrace that and they try to broaden\nIt by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was a neck would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny\nSome of those basic principles including the first one which is you know Nick didn't agree for a long time is is that he that he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to nearly die more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you were in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in ... step programs and in recovery I think it it is a huge problem because I Try I spent a lot of time you know trying so hard to practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe\nAnd ultimately you know when I sit with myself and the quiet moments you know when I'm a when\nYou know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are just fundamentally you don't believe in God or any you know reason to this world or anything I think that they are at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nThat's a trip but but the other thing that I think is really important to that we learned is that there isn't just one way there isn't just one way to get healthy and sober and to stop using the first thing that Nick told me about when he arrived at this last program\nWas he sat with a um counselor and the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of of rehab and so he said what you know he thought the expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and alcoholic\nAnd the guy said well wait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that we had was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside\nAnd that's what I'm you know ... ... ... you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think that that I mean you know that's what he says that that that those three months were essential\nTo do that program that you not rely on the higher power principle\nDidn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and now as a part of that but um\n... and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of got to really go back and it's where every experience some of the traumas that experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and greed them you know for the first time really ... allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know I've tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to love myself and you know today like I I mean I don't want to kill myself you know I I don't at all now I Love my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't have anything to do\nWith a higher power for me but uh for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody that feels that way absolutely\nDavid did you find that you know something that you could describe as a higher power\n[noise] I I learned to define it in in a way that works for me which is um it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to el ... I was told by someone\nBefore this is over you believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in\nPrayer it is the way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said I'm going to pray I'm going to do what they told me about all of a sudden really part moments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get through and what\nDoes family mean to you if you don't believe in God\n\nYou know it's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was ... it was a it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to ... I was saying please please please save Mac\nPlease help heal my son I remember that's what I found that to myself over and over and over again [noise] uh and it was way be that way just to stay sane its effect focused on something that you know I could hold onto or maybe I was you know hedging my bats maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNikki nicotine that there's um the part of what saved you from your math addiction was a degree of self knowledge they were helped to acquire in your last rehab mhm and that I think was the rehab in which you were diagnosed with having bipolar disorder which is basically manic depression um\nDid that help getting a diagnosis and then getting the medication to deal with a diagnosis\nYes I I mean that's the you know it's a ... I think it's like very very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar medication and it's it's so subtle I mean I couldn't even tell you necessarily you know what the differences are or how it's helping me\nIt's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle in terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself yeah a little bit more on yet so I think that if you need it you know if you get a really good doctor that knows what they're doing you know they can help you I think that's often after they're\nAt nic tells the story in his book that to me is so profound and it's done in just a beautiful way I think um he came to see us I'm Carrying my my wife and Jasper and daisy\nOr we were in if we hadn't seen that for a long time and and care and said you know let's let's invite next to join us we were going on a family vacation and it's and it came over to the U.S\nAnd we were hanging out we had a really good time it was you know we talked a lot and it was very open and he talked to the kids about what they've been going on and it was you know sort of the apologize to them in a way that's I think it was just so meaningful to them into Karen and to me and\nWe had a really good time and then he describes the day before he was leaving he got\nJust really annoyed by you talked about you know he's ready to kill me and all of a sudden it hit him that\nTomorrow I'm leaving oh I'm that's what's going on here I'm studying my I I don't really want to leave part of me wants to stay here\nAnd be a child again it'd be you know with my family and\nSo I'm sort of ... ... and then all of a sudden he said he felt he said that I felt I felt better now and and he went back in the rest of the trip was it was great we had a really nice last day but then he said what just happened he says another time in my life that moment\nWould have just been the beginning of dissent and it would have been the kind of dissent rather ended up and you're going out to have a drink or to get some pot and then some math and he said how could it be the fact that I'm On this new medication and I just thought it was such a beautiful description of the way that it all works together\nWell listen congratulations to both of you on on on the books in on the friday Nick and you know ... good luck with some you know with continuing anything anything

later and said he was ready to go into treatment but he absolutely could have died\nIn that story you basically had two options and I can think of one is to say well if I'm not driving you rehab I'm not picking up at all and the other is okay I'll take it home you chose the if I'm not driving you to rehab I'm not taking you home it alone you think you're lucky that he didn't die as a result and then he chose to go to rehab a few days later\nSo in retrospect do you think you'd have you should have chosen the other option is which is what have been I'll take it home and maybe you wouldn't have gone to me\nI think that every situation is different and in retrospect it was fine in retrospect you know it worked but if I was there again I Would have gone to them and brought him home\nAnd [noise] done everything I could to get him into treatment because every day he was out there it was so dangerous I mean that night I didn't sleep of course I was just petrified and I had a reason to

addiction to mess has been made into a movie starring Steve Carell\nIf your child under Eighteen you can um force them to go into rehab right\nMost places you can it's it's yes you can it's not easy and some states it's really complicated you have to get judges orders you have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that\nI never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage\nYou know he was living at home he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he'll be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage I never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by\nW sea ice is standing members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nWhatever it takes to get someone to treatment that's what we got to do what were the other way well sometimes nickel just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would you know he ... he just wanted to\nGet off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening um and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know Dr either treatment center check you in\nAnd so he would do it um but as things went forward I mean the last time that ... you know he'd been sober for a long time it was after Nick and I talk to you on your show\nAnd you know one day we were together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of vodka then I took one I thought to myself just one\nWhich is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us and soon the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week\nSo he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the handled and treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day\nTo me it's possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatments before that were a failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments has helped him so much\nThat he was able to recognize that he was in freefall that it was so dangerous for him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt\nEither the craving that would lead to relapse or you can stop a relapse early and if you can you know you've made so much progress ... one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so you know when they got in that play on that day\nI saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so ah\nIt shows that it's possible I mean people think that treatment can't work a Knicks proof that it does\nSo let's talk a little bit of that twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience\nIn in a twelve step program is probably going to you know a a twelve step program for parents Elena yeah yeah and then you visited them just as research for the book do you see you see you know positives and negatives with the ... step program\nSo I think most people know what the positive uh parts are but what are some of the problems you have to stop\nThe twelve steps are completely a profound you know treatment for so many people but not most people and that's the problem that I have it's not what the twelve steps it's only many many rehabbed are based on this idea\nThat the twelve steps are the key aren't the only way to stay sober that's my problem\nSo my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced and it it's forced in many places Nick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embrace the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternatives but I did go to Ellen on meetings\nAnd what I found there was something different that helped me you know when it became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I\nI was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people tell me over and over and over again go to Ellen on meetings got Allentown meetings I Would sort of roll my eyes and thing I'm not going into one of those rooms where\nPeople are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally and I felt you know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was profound for me\nAlso going into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to put on the face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to be my younger children daisy and Jasper school and and you know I had to keep it together\nI walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling is and I was able to cry and I was able to\nYou know there was no pretty tense and those rooms there was this open this it didn't make things go away but it made it easier to get through some of the day's\nLesson on a positive note [laughter] and and if it's OK ... if not prying into your son next privacy\nWell now professionally as well as person that just gives all update on his life that's that's not prying too much\nIt's it's not I mean this is really you know I think he's great country what can I say if he's an unbelievable person I've been out of his dad and so I'm I'm president but he\nHit extraordinary has just this lovely person that he helps a lot of people getting stay sober I hear from people all the time you know kids who say I read next book I heard him talk and that's why I've gone into recovery\nIs really healthy he exercises every day he got married to this woman that we adore you know they were best friends when they were sixth and seventh grade he's writing like mad he defended novel or accepted\nSo you know we're just so lucky whereas if they're lucky I'm I mean all these other things are are great but the main thing is that he's alive there were so many times when I didn't think he was going to make it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Brewster", "day": "19"}
