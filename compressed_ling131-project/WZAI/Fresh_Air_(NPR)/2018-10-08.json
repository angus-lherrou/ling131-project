and twenty twelve he was born in Montreal and Nineteen Seventy two and I'm going to talk with us about Leonard Cohen as a writer performer and father and tell us about working closely with his father

feel privileged to have had the chance to hear him in concert and to talk with him on her show and I'm grateful for the chance to talk with you today and thank you for being here when I interviewed your father and two thousand six after the publication of a book of his poems and songs\nHe asked to read a poem that he just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in his new book the flame so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of that home a street or from our two thousand six interview\nOr used to be your favorite drunk good for one

when it's over a much rent to when we moved all be waiting on this corner where they're used to be a street\nIt was an old uh do you see when you up and walked away\nBut all the needs a little story for another rainy day I Know your burdens videos you will it through the night to group says it's empty but that doesn't mean it's like\nWe were writing some kind of mysterious wind and the grace of the occasion there was an urgency to the entire mission and of course it has to do with a serious health issues he was a mobilized you had multiple compression fractures\nOf his spine and it involves an incredible monastic effort on his part to [noise]\nTo be present and to deliver the way he did but\n[noise] something about his work in general not just on the last album but in this book and in general\nYou into your own inner life because he takes the inner life seriously he's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there\nAre many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become misspelled tracks there just down jacks because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate in things whereas this man was speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard cons\nFinal lyrics homes notebook injuries and drawings and these are all collected in the new book the flame and Adam Cohen wrote the introduction that we're going

Cape and islands dot org [noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard cons final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished\nAnd it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection and the ... collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this problems\nI think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult the work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... stone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nIf you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes\nBut there was this like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is struggling you let the idea of you you reading of homes yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they haven't met that have his work as a life outside of his mouth\n... and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room quietly reading his poems so\nI've always wanted to I Want to get on their record as say no and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many on millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and ah and exist the way songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry that I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book and observing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are imbedded in every line taking their own time\nNot with my metered with my voice\nSince you've declined to read more pounds that your father I Wonder if I remember reading about being ... can tanker is or in transit you\nKnow it's just it's a it's I'd\nI can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading and not another problem with us\nFrom the interview that we recorded in the thousands fan and this is a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was kindly accorded me even though I could barely cardio June\nFor many years I was known as a month I shaved my head in war robes and got up very early I hated to everyone but I acted generously and no one found me out\nMy reputation as a ladies' man was a joke it caused me to laugh bitterly through the ten thousand nights I spent a loan\nFrom a third storey window above the puck deport you gal I've watched the snow come down all day\nAs usual there is no one here they're never is mercifully the inner conversation is canceled by the white noise of winter\nI Am neither the mind the intellect nor the silent voice within that's also castles\nAnd now gentle reader in what name in whose name do you come to idol with me in these low 'cause she already is and twin things realms of aimless privacy\nI think that home and um get so little that when you were talking about the connection of your father riding in solitude and reader re reading alone and as you know during his [laughter] yeah and during his solitude yeah\nAs you noted also kind of uh humor you know I mean I remember I Love one of his lines where he says uh feel so good not to love you like I did it's like the tour away my blindfold and said we're going to let this prisoner live [laughter] that that was hilarious\nMy guess is Adam Cole and he's\nUnpublished writings and

selling Marion hey that's no way to say goodbye burn on a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear them all you do if you didn't need me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs\nAnd singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nWhat's the sun and who's singing it um but but you were you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did and you must have been like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course I heard them you know I I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a heartless going out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the mentality of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older\nThat was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling language and um\n[noise] and you grow older than you than you sort of see I remember um I remember I myself was making a record at the time and it's scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know maybe maybe I really got to talk to you\nWhen you contributed WBAI you ensure that we can keep providing the important news and information you rely on every day support WC ay ay Cape and islands dot org\nAnd on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and scrap you record that's an amateur move\nSandwich remove he said yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd at that moment I realized that um\nThe love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but it was also bought their intention out he was holding up the baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that ah\nThat baton off the ground [noise] were you and your parents separated um five six and ... the don't remember how much did you get to see a father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of a union between two people has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father\nWas able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me\nUm I my mother moved\nMy sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow our own whims and uh my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nHe'd always you always maintained a role\nUm in in our lives despite my parents' separation ... like a mobile home [noise]\nYeah they are like what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm yeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we live to and there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things he put it\nRoad and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead in his care of and how long is it that far\nWell he did that and variations of that through my own entire life and and so\nAs I say they are the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate this with which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own ways may be responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for for um his reconnection to people I'm Around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing is sold to sell all the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] [noise] yeah you know\nHe often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry I'm an incredible that [laughter]\nThat would the canon of his work and with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experienced this uh this episode that you're referring to is it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time up since ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nYou'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis a rose this most unexpected and\n[noise] festive of periods in his life I Want to save face\nThe um [noise] the amount of universities to suddenly started teaching is works I'm studying is works or even [noise] a whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics as liturgy um\nMadison Square garden and be able to you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being feel they have never sold more than six thousand
