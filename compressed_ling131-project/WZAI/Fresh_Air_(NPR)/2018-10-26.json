Davies in for Terry Gross last year the NC double a college\nBasketball tournament known as March Madness was seen by Ninety seven million TV viewers [noise]\n\nOur gas writer Michael ... says the money and recognition this board generates has led to a host of corrupt practices in the recruitment of players were the top college basketball programs\nTalented athletes as young as twelve for targeted for manipulation by St agents soccer love described as dealers in human athletic flash many of those corrupt practices were exposed in an FBI investigation which led to a sprawling indictment that rocked the basketball world last year\nIn the first of three trials in the case the federal jury yesterday convicted three men of conspiring to use cash payments to recruit players to college basketball programs including the University of Louisville it's legendary coach Rick Pitino wasn't charged but the scandal cost him his job\nHe's one of the subjects of ... new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball I spoke to suck a lot of yesterday when the jury and the case was still deliberating\nWell my ... welcome back to fresh air you know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money just college basketball generate\nWell billions I mean it really depends on how you calculate it directly to the universities into the NC double a billions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites in all these crazy ways\nYou know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year right and where does the money go\nThe money largely goes to the adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out searching scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year\nThe rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches and make as much as a half million dollars a year\nAll throughout the athletic department people are making\nIt's not go to the players and what I call the unpaid workforce\nAnd a thousand or more pliers a couple of hundred college coaches and they're playing in gyms all over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they are being scouting\nIt's not only by college coaches but also by\nThese characters who exist on the fringes I think of it almost like boxing back in the day these sort of Damon Runyon ask characters who are they're just sort of see what's in it for them\nAnd the one hand there can be seen as colorful but also just like boxing back in the day they're exploitive their dealers in human athletic flesh and they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college Ken I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life and one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who referred to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino story of corruption scandal in the big business of college basketball we'll continue our conversation after a short break this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nIs fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\n[noise] so in a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's it's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to you write that\nInvolved in recruiting explain what they do how they're ...\nThe assistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches it used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he talked the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere but\nThe assistant coaches that's their job get me kids\nThe thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coach who say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know\nThese assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nBut you have these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of this story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges [noise]\nBut then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nThat's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there\nWith taking bribes from these runners or go betweens on the grass roots circuit and the intent of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros\nSend him to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[noise] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you manage to have for in some way or another and get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more so\nIf you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that adds up to a whole lot if you were quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars if I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player\nI don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes\nManage their money or if you get traded their specialists who will set you up in a new city they will go to\nPrivate schools and figure out what private school your child should go to they will find you a designer for your new house and an interior designer so sports is a very insular business and a lot of the players want to deal with known quantities\nAnd part of this is there's the money manager he manages NBA players money so the game is to become one of those guys and then they have one of these go betweens set you up with a with players\n... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and

recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what did Pitino say about\n\nPitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees a sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this and the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be\nGate and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem\nAnd Pitino does not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says\nAnd right now coach Geno has a pending case against the University of

college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried were convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked what the FBI did was put names and faces\nW UCI sustaining members helped make this live stream possible were grateful for the ongoing support to learn more about becoming a sustaining member visit Cape and islands dot org\nWas knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time\nThat was a shock ... and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\n\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so the one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke was quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that\nBut the fact that coach case that it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you write that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nWhat kind of sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and then there's certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe one of the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs\nAnd they're not real students their loyalty and their their responsibility is to their team\nIt's up to forty or fifty or sixty hours a week and you're not paying them you know you are you are having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through and not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a persists in the myth of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nWhen it come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that the shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations is a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nI Do think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be just in the way that people conduct possibly criminal activity\nI think people will be more careful and you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them you know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity\nI think they'll become more careful sunny the Cairo the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grass roots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy you also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on that case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we cover this I mean you said that in some respects she went apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in these charges\nThe apparel companies have been very quiet they have put out sort of vanilla statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet\nAdidas executive who is one of the ... current defendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and find like James ghetto who ... executive his father was a high school coach he's an insider he's a basketball insider almost all of these defendants are well liked well known\nInsiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas and Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they're planning on much to change either if they can help\nMichael ... thanks so much for speaking with us thank you it's great to be on with

wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nBut it will mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I\nWell yeah that's true and that and there are people I mean this was a really I mean it's a very it's an issue very much at the moment interestingly because I'm kind of gone around the block\nSee anything he was on I like fluid in his ... yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's a describes them as inter and [laughter] that's the kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of flu but he was really gay and the other day I got one of those and it was you know as a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends\nShe was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you gauge the adage you so you wanted to see you know and I I think Lou was kind of hoping to go and wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had to language for it then\nWell that's right they didn't that language didn't exist\nIf I did one of the guy I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that but when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI Am here for a price on Iran I ...\nKnow and and uh I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap\nIntroducing a guide you ever want to spend money we were living in these all these small places he would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took lose story as you know the truth and I just said well with his father ever of giving them money and she said of course he would have given him money\nYou know if it's anything for the you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business\nHe couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand would ever lose needed at it and he was there and you know that was one of the complexity flu dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seem\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own you didn't have any money not eat set so that he got a job working for his father typing up in his father's accounting office yeah six I mean how transgression of is that [laughter] I'm\nNot totally they don't have any I always see what's hey goes you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to to buy time and make money and if they were there the ... yeah exactly yeah\nSomebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City um\nThat his parents were waiting for him in the car driving back to Long Island I mean I could never get that confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately\nAnd you know they kind of relationship\nThat was a you know along with\nA you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize them in song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl but ah yeah but in real life you know we got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of have yet to convey expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for lead\n[noise] well it's you know that's very interesting question because you know um [noise] yeah ... ... a a Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular and you know just going to make some movies now and you know it sounds like we should have a banjo rock and roll is going to be a thing and so they ...\nYou know through some you know and you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for ...\nUm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio decided that the the velvet underground more kind of too boring looking\nSo they got Nico yeah who was a you know a German model an actress and soon to be finger to you know to be their lead singer Lewis not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of disability\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with it he limited Nico was participation as much as he could you know um she only saying you know a few songs\nOr the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could he got ... you know he kicked Nico out of the band as well after having an affair\nAnd well that's very true [laughter] exactly it was you know part of those times\nUm and that was a you know so that was one of the issues of Warhol a Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time where I was in the newspapers all the time they're not\n... you know not art critics reading about it and although that too but it's just like a this crazy guy you know he thinks that Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspaper so whatever he did got attention and ah you know Lou took advantage of that\nBut that also hurt the velvet underground in that\nYou know rock and roll certainly back then was a pretty Ernest thing and the I wore whole seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a band you know for for people who have entered them yet you know in her ... now so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think\nLuke felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go I you know this needs to be more professional operation and you know there's no way Andy Warhol was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nGuess is Anthony ... the author of the books we read a life it's just been published in paperback after a break
