born until the day my mother died she told me about who I Am who we are from my brothers are my family\nJust picking up a box personal family lore small set of data points and yeah the ones on which warns opponents most notably President Trump announced she set\nBecause their votes were Hi was it and did that she was Native American in July he escalated I won't give you a million dollars for your favorite charity paid for by trouble\nIf you take the test that it shows you earn it here\nThis week Warren responded by way of a five and a half minutes pretend pain video and then she speaks with Carlos Bustamante a Stanford genetics professor who examine to DNA\nAnd the hunger genome we did find five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence jak that's what we have a Native American ancestry and you're\nThe response was probably not what Warren had anticipated\nShe came out and thought she scored at first yes and so to the media and it's sort of the men Donald Trump pay off the million dollar bet and then all of a sudden now she is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that are you sort of DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests\nFrom both the right and left appropriate and accusations that she's not native enough that she is reinforcing biological essential Islam that she's falling for a Trump trap before the midterms\nThat she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity Bonner high it's\nA political miscalculation but also a study in ...\nOr beyond politics\nThere's a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother Cherokee princess and their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nKim Paul ... is a professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us as a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is I don't mean to sound cliche\nBut everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual land and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings and family and tribe or not govern so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe know in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA\nAnd ever since talk of blood is lineage and fate have given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk\nPlays out in native culture I\nPeople against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you weren't looking as tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors\nThe dog's allotment acts at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land to heads of households and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be has household they would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child\nBut in order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indian swelled tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities and didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people in their can these are fluid can ship groups right but now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment discovered ...\nWhat we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base real you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nWhen you see on the back of my traveling rolling card that I Am one thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and Rob a whole blood quote unquote is my grandfather Randy tall there\nIt's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were\nFor us it's who is your mom who's your grandmother who's your great grandfather who your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining around the whole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if he were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly Thirteen thirty seconds\nNative American my daughter would be one half of that\nBecause her father is non native now if my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to want it\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards linear will defend rules to try to make our rules more inclusive\nNeed the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonized we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore [noise]\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood then the women then this is something ... she got some set in the New York or you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his\n... you know I don't think he has\nThe intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren ... I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma in the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this myth of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nYou know certainly for African Americans even though there's very much a historical and understandable desire to\nBe able to lay claim to identities that are not just about race that's calf mhm it's also the case that particularly a place like the United states and twenty Eighteen that's deeply polarized and becoming\nDeeply racialized no one is making find distinctions in the workplace and the housing market between forms of African ethnicity or whether or not someone is deemed to be\nJust black or white and what those

did they learn how their lives have been manipulated for a trove of data\nThat remains largely locked away and an archive at Yale according to Dr Nancy ... the director of the twin studies center at California State University at full attend the unruly study was likely inconclusive and definitely cruel\nWell I I think this was a very unethical study keep in mind that even though in those times the practice and was it and you don't encourage contact\nBut nevertheless these children were never told they were twins and most of his adoptive parents who are hungry for children would have gladly taken too so to not tell people this very important aspect of their background I\nThink is just horrendous it's really beyond my comprehension and I find that because being a twin is a very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart\nJust how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture the public imagination but none quite like NASA's twin study which tracked the genetic profiles of two astronaut brothers one who'd spent a year in space while a twin lived on earth the me had a few with this Scott\nIdentical twin astronauts in history but following DNA altering space mission they may not be identical anymore but you are in faith had already made got two inches taller than a brother\n... seven percent of Scott's James or not return to normal after he returned to or from years ago\nSo they're no longer identical twins space travel altered genetic expression it did not ultimately and they physically itself\nWhen he returned to earth the vast majority of his genetic material to return to the way it was initially see this is a fascinating finding because white identical twins differ in the expression of some traits that we need to find out I think it'll fascinate your listeners to know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia\nOr multiple sclerosis or diabetes you'd expect that the correlation should be about one they have the same genes but it's closer to forty fifty percent\nSomething has to trigger the expression in one and keep it quiet and the other and identical twins where it apart or identical twins who different some white and help us find these environmental effects that might help us control and manage disease [noise]\nYou've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers accidental brothers follows the life history as of two sets identical male twins\nWho were born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city and the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as the other twins were born\nAnd somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange with one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other I went to Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role the twins in the city had gone to\nTwins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life history is amazing the one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary [noise]", "show_name": "On the Media", "year": "2018", "city": "Brewster", "day": "20"}
