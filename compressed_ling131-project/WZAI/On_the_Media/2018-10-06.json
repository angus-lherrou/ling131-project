was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nWas never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folk at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seven cavalry stopped spotted outspent sue as well as some other allied bans and surrounded them\nThe next day they moved to disarm them\nIt's not really known what caused the shooting in the first place but almost immediately the government open fire with ... cannons on largely an armed men women and children [noise]\nThe descriptions of the massacre are horrifying you quoted a reporter from the Deadwood South Dakota times who wrote why should we stay or even a ... of an Indian\nAnd then you have an el Frank bomb author of the wonderful wizard of Oz writing for the south Dakota Saturday pioneer he said\nHaving wronged them for centuries we had better in order to protect our civilization follow it up with one more wrong and white fees on pained and came up all creatures from the face of the year\nBy virtue of being wrong to run our threat\nAlmost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceedings four hundred years of interactions between calling us and indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything had to come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the massacre they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic break my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American\nBush and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college I was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the war isn't the end of the massacre when to name where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I Hope by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation the leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota was nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\n[noise] it took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that the brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate\nMissed the point when did me was a low point we had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz thought was the year before the browns book came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians in to the national spotlight the declared it Indian land and they camped out\nAnd and they really weren't met\n[noise] we wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and having this this land nearby all for the following trading real purchased said felt the trails island for twenty four dollars and glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar out and about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of tune from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nThis is we got down there the whole the whole courtyard was covered with a FBI agents right [noise] they all had rifles and shotguns and and they and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nThe curve and was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kinds of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWasn't really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\n[laughter] yes I mean they hammered out sort of a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had done a dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and it lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timber and mineral lease is among other things\nThe government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the ... trashed the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself and the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ... one of Nixon's guys a Batman even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of at sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rats\nThat's on the line to join that care of and\n[noise] and then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indian suffering and injustice\nThat's right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time this current that we have to commit violence in order to be heard\nAnd I don't want to see him but he killed the kinds of violence who might have to be committed [noise]\nThere'd been a number of very high profile\nMurder of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who\nWere murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or\nMisdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd so for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded knee was under siege\n[noise]\n\n\nYou say you have very complicated feelings about it\nHaving everything stolen from us\nIndian lives our lives of loss that's how our lives are most often understood and I think a better narrative is to think of our lives as as full of plenty\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability an intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so [noise]\nIn my mind it's the story of surplus [noise]\nThat's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much thank\nYou so much I'm really speaking out to be on show\nDavid trier isn't a chip away from the leech lake
