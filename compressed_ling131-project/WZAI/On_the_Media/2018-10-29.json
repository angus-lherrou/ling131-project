to one of the media just adding\nNot until the last couple of days we're speaking on Thursday Afternoon it was kind of mysterious how this\nGigantic population of truckers what's so quickly coalesce but we now know more and it begins I guess with a guy named bar tolo Fuentes a leftist former politician in Honduras what was his role in all of this\nWell see I think at that stage yet according to

Honduras the government wants to minimize what people are leaving they know\nThey're going to leave and they want to say that they're doing so because of lives and the opposition not the conditions that they that is the government created\nThis is in line with what the United States is saying\nThat there are false promises being made and this pro government news program played into that messaging trying to say that there is financing when people really just need to get out\nThere is this right wing media me it's actually video of service members\nBeing paid cash money\nAs the story

around hunter is is that this is funded by the opposition of Honduras and that is sort of a political game that people within the country are playing\nThat sort of more than wine that I've been seeing

Bob Garfield\nAn election day Massachusetts citizens will weigh in on a referendum known as question three a yes vote preserves existing protections for trans individuals' against discrimination in public spaces\nA no vote returns the state to it's pre twenty sixteen status quo in which transgender was not it legally protected class\nThe messaging on the no side of question three has featured the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle with it and the American culture wars including this attack ad produced by the no on three campaign\nWhen did math questions we mean can you\nAnd woman can enter a woman cannot\nDowntown primary medium\nTo find [noise] it's almost comical a anti trans video but in a remarkable exercise in political hold me up at the the activists on the other side of the question many themselves trans went door to door to share that ad\nWith potential voters it was not random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman who a few years ago in Florida on another trans related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charge the age old political process\nBut just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nA lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there's no way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories but well we actually found in the research is that canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training\nWere able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door had the conversation and told a story from their life so I think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if they're approached in such a way from a\nFriendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation with them\nSo once you initiated the perspective of having what's the effect that person becomes suddenly more open to other ... groups like trans citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you'd randomly assign patients to a blood pressure pill or a sugar pill we did the same thing in this study where we randomly assigned voters to either get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group that got a door knocked about recycling what we find when we do a series of follow up surveys\nThree days three weeks six weeks and three months later\nIs that when we compare the group that we had the conversation with at the door versus the group we could have but did not\nThat treatment group is significantly more accepting of transgender people across a variety of items the average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is it if you look at the change on items that measure attitudes towards gay men and lesbians and the average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve\nWe see a similar effect from these ten twenty minute conversations as we see in the public in general from Nineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big effect\nDoes this and knock you lay them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing\nOne thing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those trends phobic advertisements to say well if we show them these ads is the effect of the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner\nAlthough we do find the ad has some immediate effects we still find a treatment group we campus is much more supportive\nMore over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely ... what we find time again is that the effects of those kinds of mass media advertisements are very ephemeral\nMm no doesn't your research fly in the face of academic orthodox\nPain theory we're actually entering this really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine move from putting leeches on people and telling anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so\nYou should put a leash on yourself to where we are kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous real world randomized trials that revolutionized medicine so there's different versions of orthodoxy depending on who you subscribe to but my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little about the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the last word on the matter is much more like one of the first words on the matter at this particular kind of intervention but we're doing lots of follower of work on other issues like immigration abortion to kind of flesh out or understanding of this\nTV campaigns reach a lot a lot a lot of people\nAnd a door to door canvassing is limited to a number of volunteers who have to fan out in the community\nWhich is why the campaign industrial complex is built around\nTelevision advertising so let's just say the effects that you found in your studies\nHold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom of political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns that Bernie Sanders' campaign in ... sixteen that ... campaign right now in Texas and many others\nWho have succeeded in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so from my perspective if campaigns don't try and really think about the art and science of recruiting volunteers and building a team to talk to their neighbors\nThen it's no surprise that if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success and in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy that normative leap we might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to be able to bankroll a serious field team\nBut you need is a candidate or a cause that many kinds of engaged individuals' want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three will that tell us anything definitive about inoculation\nIs there some way that we could find ourselves on sound or statistical flooding on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science too\nThe resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election result that's kind of a trap that that research on campaigns and elections and campaign consultant who's been in for a hundred years we really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign\nIf they had done something else which of course we can't do because the campaign only happened a particular way so that's why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else to say we can actually see what happens when we do this and when we don't\nYeah but just between you and me should I be like investing heavily in clipboard futures [laughter] well\nI think what we tend to see in other industries that as new ideas and innovations come out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so\nI don't know that I think that campaigns will or even necessarily should be taking this one study we have and ... other activities around it within the next year hope on the scale of ten or Twenty years we'll have built up the kind of evidence based that\nIs very persuasive and rigorous and the prejudice reduction advocates uh will be interested in
