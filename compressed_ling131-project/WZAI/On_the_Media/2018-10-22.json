or directory in Nineteen eighty six you continue to list yourself in those director reasons so Nineteen Ninety five [noise]\nDo you consider yourself a minority and if not\nI have answer this question many many times and it starts with the fact that from the day I was born until the day my mother died she told me about who I Am who we are from my brothers are like family\nJust picking up a box

... campaign video in it and she speaks with Carlos Bustamante Stanford genetics professor who examine to DNA\nAnd the hunger genome we did find five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence that we have a Native American ancestry and you're better\nThe response was probably not what Warren had anticipated\nShe came out and thought she scored at first yes and so does the media and it's sort of men Donald Trump pay off the million dollar bet and then all of a sudden she's at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that are used to the DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining ...\nAnd the left appropriations accusations that she's not native enough that she is reinforcing biological essential Islam that she's falling for a Trump trap before the midterms\nThat she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity bomb a ...\nA political miscalculation but also a stumble into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere's a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother Cherokee princess and their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nKim Paul ... is a professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us has a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer Z I don't mean to sound cliche\nBut everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual lands and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and try and are not govern so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA\nAnd ever since talk of blood is lineage and fate have given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk plays out in native culture\nCaution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different\nAds tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors\nBut does a lot ... at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land to heads of households and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be has household they would get another eighty acres if they had a wife\nWomen become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men and then the man gets another forty acres for each child but\nIn order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities and didn't necessarily have lists with names of their\nPeople in their can these are fluid kinship groups right but now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment as governor and\nWhat we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that\nTime and by the base real you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nWhen you see on the back of my tribal enrollment card that I'm One thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and a rabbit hole blood quote unquote is my grandfather Randy tall there\nIt's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were\nFor us it's who's your mom who's your grandma who's your great grandfather who your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining ... blood\nWhere you begin to see the racial inflection I think so my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly Thirteen thirty seconds native\nBecause her father is non native now if my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to want it\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards ... will defend rules to try to make our rules more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonized we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood then the women then this is something ... she got some set in the New York or you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his ... you know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren of I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma\nAnd the south and in the east of the U.S [noise] lived with this mess of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people\nShe's probably really invested in defending her family story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nYou know certainly for African Americans even though there's very much a historical and understandable desire to\nBe able to lay claim to identities that are not just about race as calf\nMhm it's also the case that particularly in a place like the United states and twenty Eighteen that's deeply polarized and becoming deeply racialized no one is making find distinctions in the workplace and the housing market between forms of African ethnicity or whether or not someone is deemed to be\nJust black or white and what those racial identities experience as they are entitled people to or don't entitle people too in the

two years ago\nSo they're no longer identical twins the space travel altered genetic expression it did not ultimately and they physically itself\nWhen he returned to earth the vast majority of his genetic material to return to the way it was initially see this is a fascinating finding because white identical twins differ in the expression of some traits that we need to find out I think it'll fascinate your listeners to know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia\nOr multiple sclerosis or diabetes you'd expect that the correlation should be about one they have the same genes but it's close to the forty fifty percent\nSomething has to trigger the expression in one and keep it quiet and the other and identical twins where it apart or identical twins ... different some white and help

your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life history as of two sets identical male twins\nWho were born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city and the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as the other twins were born and somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange with one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later so they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact\nW ... members helped make this live stream possible were

schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life history is amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary\n[noise] so what does this tell you about nature versus nurture it was too small a sample I Know", "show_name": "On the Media",
