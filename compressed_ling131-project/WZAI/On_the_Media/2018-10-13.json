a very\nActually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be and in the nineteenth century as economics was becoming professionalized economists picked up this barter origin story for money and kind of set it forced into the world\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a

coincidence of wants which is what economists call that problem when you know I've got fish and you've got apples and you don't want my fish and I don't want your Apple's so it's great to justify current conditions\nBut when you start kind of cracking it open and starts that appealing back the layers and realizing that\nThat's not really how it happened in that how it happened was you know actually a lot more interesting in a lot more complicated and involved things like record keeping accounting systems of measure uh states and early state control and shaping of markets and so forth
