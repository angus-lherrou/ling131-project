in a casino in southern Washington state's feeling ill are driven down from Seattle where I live now a friend of mine who was visiting Portland, Oregon and uh so driven down to to see him um\n... because you know on the way a gamble a little bit and then went to Portland hung out with him spent the night and I was back in the casino and I was hung over and ill in part because I was in a casino and uh casinos are a little bit sad [noise]\nAnd small casinos in impoverished rural areas are a little bit extra set [noise]\nAnd I was also concerned about my own gambling and my relationship to what I was doing at that moment I used to play blackjack for a living I was a card counter um which is called counting as a a legitimate um\nMathematically valid method for winning at the casino game blackjack and I I used to do that for a living and then uh and then my life took an unexpected\nCourse since I Am sitting at a table thinking about these things and suddenly the man next to me has dealt a hand he gets a twenty as his hand a but it's not an ordinary twenty it's made up of chew queens apart screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts and as soon as I saw that hand hit the table I thought maybe\nUm everything's going to be All right\nNow I used to kind of cards for a living and I was taught to do that by a group of friends and mentors or who were some extraordinary people very brilliant very poised prosperous and sort of beautiful in a way and they are incorporated me into a blackjack team that they had been operating for some time and taught me how to go into

wide and just stuffed it down my pants so that was\nPhysically expanded in this weird for cheaper in a way sort of like in the old days but I turned around and I wasn't in Las Vegas I was in this ...\nThis small place where there were twenty five or thirty people all staring at me customers at the casino people who work there weren't going around and everybody there and knew exactly what I had just one\nAnd it seems at the cashier they knew I was getting paid in cash and so I moved briskly for the ...\nAnd a briskly across the parking lot and I started the engine of my car drove out made a

an assumed name Lee Aaron Blair\nA under a student\nValue the sort of value of a card counters real name tends to deteriorate overtime as he does become increasingly aware of it\nUm but also because it's long been obvious to me the card counter if you'd legally changed his name should change it to three or more first name's presents a piece of ID to a person in a casino he can claim that any one of the names is actually the first name and\nYou know depending on how familiar the casino personalities with that particular form of id they're often you know they see ideas from all over the country

it's not too difficult for them it was cold and mosque night called I went to the story from the front line here [noise]\n\n[laughter]\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy suburb\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man that I felt war would be exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and paintings and a few\nThousand dollars and I went to Bosnia during the civil war is a story of all to try to learn to be a war reporter at war with all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about

Kosovo during the civil war\nReally beautiful um she'd been I'm taken by surprise military forces are and they took her up to a field above a talent goes to a record\nAnd they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat [noise] and when I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summer it was hot\nAnd the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stayed with me for a while she was more than I bargained for [noise]\nUm [noise]\nI remember the first time I got ready to die to die\nPrepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines and it was\nA goat getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to freak out I got an a jeep was a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really were good for much and when and if not a couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\n[noise] and I tried to get ready I was hollow I was numb\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt at all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see\nThe little black hole that the boy comes out of you know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot and another guy grab the barrel and jerked it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was attorney inside those holes\nAnd they're so small the thickness of a pencil and attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look at it but for some reason they didn't kill us\nAnd we drove back to Freetown and um [noise] I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand\nRose in combat\nYou go to war you think do you think you're going to be\nBrave [noise] have you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd [noise]\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo Toni may have positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um [noise] but this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against them\nSandbags and some dirt fluent ... side of my face [noise]\nAnd when you have to understand about bullets that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you asked yourself am I getting shot at it gives the sounds of bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then as everything goes crazy well the boy\nThe boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face it that's what I felt\nWhat's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches\nTo the right to know what's the mass on that angle you don't even want to think about it\nUm and then it's all you can think about\nWell I was paralyzed bullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting of sandbags smacking unit everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bullet proof that\nWe're getting a tax on three sides they're coming up under the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire\nAnd I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there\nHe finally jumps across that gap and he grabs stuff he throws my camera to me it throws my bullet proof Bessie grabs and stuff it's throwing image of soldiers 'cause the soldiers are pinned down too\nAnd he gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared any more [noise]\nTim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously very very brave a lot braver than me um\nOnly situation where young men\nAre free to love each other on reserve is without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we're going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot\nOn this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Achilles on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of hail up So Tim took the next trip\n[noise]\nHe was on a on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up\nUp in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American positions got overrun they dragged off a wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that Tim broke his leg he did ten thousand feet up on the coast guard with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long\nAnd the medical examiner foot inside as well as broken we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by Don and we're going to get hammered\nHere's two Advil\nAnd Tim new ... knew that if you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it I don't know how but he did it to go down on that mountain [noise]\nSo we finished up our deployment and um
