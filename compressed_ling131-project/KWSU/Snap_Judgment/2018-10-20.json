and my mom's wedding down\nAnd she went along with all of this [laughter] she actually went with me to thrift stores picking out all the ... plate if we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little town first for the twelve cake we're going to have is twelve I'm a big believer in cake so\nHe cared about to mostly the music she actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle you compose didn't orchestrated it started off to the band and we got prepared for our big day\nIt was going to be so beautiful like an anthropology catalog threw up over everything but [noise] what I wanted [laughter]\nWe got married on April twenty fourth which was my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years when the day at my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring the same good luck and we were married outside\nSt Louis Missouri in a town called ... core which is his home town and it just back yard\nOn April twenty fourth we hung outlived twinkling light and the trees decorative little stars put out tables in my beautiful center pieces and on every seat lay down a custom made played though I had done for the event\nNow all of this preparation he failed to mention that April\nTo learning how to fold napkins and to the shape of blondes when the tornado siren went off\nAnd then came the rain and then hail\nAnd when and it knocked all of the table Dover and all of my beautiful center pieces into the mud six months of making them every night\nAnd they were destroyed no one saw any of it [noise]\nNo luckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter]\nThe only time that's lucky by the way\nWe had invited all of these circuits people but we had trapeze artist and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do this pitch a tent so [noise]\nAnd we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made got my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trapped in honor ready to be getting\nIt was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't give them a little card I made so we just proceed without her\nUm [noise]\nI was looking forward to the song\nHadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play it\nBecause the bandleader had a heart attack [noise]\nFine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing it without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nFavorite show so [noise] um [noise]\nThe photographer had never shot a wedding before still she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some guy showed up and apparently brought a stomach virus that I had not registered for um\nSo throughout the state people kept getting sick and dropping like flies\nAmongst all of this the worst part\nFor me was that my dad decided not to come I didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle and so he said I'm not going to be there I have a stepfather that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself\n[noise] but he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called him I called him and he said well I sent a check\n\nI bet that's the same thing\nI'm an only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding\nBy myself\nBut I I danced with his dad and my grandfather and I we weighed beneath the big top [laughter] he looked at me and said your dad should have been here\nAnd he should've been [noise] and then\nMaybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise]\nAll of our hamburgers

is just jak and coke but [noise]\nIn fact it with our friends\nAnd the family that showed up for us\nAfter all the details don't make the day\nAnd they don't make the marriage either because I'm not married anymore and I don't think a perfectly sunny day and matching escort card would have changed that we shouldn't have gotten married\nThere's some things even cake can't pick [noise] maybe if I hadn't been caught up in all of the preparations I Would have realized that\n[noise] but there are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happened after the big day is over\nBut even though it began with a storm it didn't end with one\nWe were married increase corps which literally translates to broken heart [noise] and my dad says now

it's another from our show in Albuquerque\nWith our partners KM Debbie here tricking reef live in [noise]\nThe right spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trailer with my partner death he's just ahead of me on the past and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now hey that's\nTwo and a half a baby\nStupid and said yeah you ever had [noise]\nNo I don't want to have a baby [noise] in his defense\nOr we had our hands full we were actually already Peron a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while I'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of Haley an Riley had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were\nJust trying to get that taste of freedom that come when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby and I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nTo a baby [noise]\nUh this has been some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender ah for me that means that I was born female I'm I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling the feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body and it was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly events\nAt um I could stay alive a and I could transition and that could be happy um which is what I did um\n\nI started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\nAnd it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine which just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not ... he's just a normal gay dude he's not normally special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby [noise]\nAnd we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to happy beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried\nA live in a world of rainbows and unicorns a\nI just hoped that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer [noise] um so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started that thing maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know I Love everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I was using their pregnancy test and then just made me and I took it and there were two lines and I was pregnant\nAnd it was going to be a baby at them but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for a baby like they can even buy diapers and learn how to take care of the baby [noise]\nHaley unwind we'd been toddlers when they came to live with that so I didn't know what to do with a baby um and then my body started to change really quickly I'm\nAn all of those markers of femininity everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on to my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is it going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like ... my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I body cannot do or\nI could get excited about the thing that I can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just about everything else go\nAhead and made around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly\nUm and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out of trend um because our lives our misery to the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes there is hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm trends in ...\nAnd and resilient and family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready [noise] um\nAnd we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nI don't know if they still say like go viral um but that is what happens um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone's don't read that\nUm [noise] CNN a Washington Post people magazine pregnant man and I thought maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know [noise]\nTrend kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there is a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trained on um a lady once told me that she adopted her needs to and she thought it was marvelous that my body to give me the life I deserve well also bringing new life into the world but\nOutside of Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um I became really good friends with the ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that\nUm people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I just a really ugly Harry woman\nAnd that I was going to give birth to a monster\nAnd then one woman sent me a message that said as a Christian I Hope that you give birth to a dead baby [noise]\nBecause that baby will be better off than a baby that has to be born to someone like you\nI was six months pregnant when I read that message you know I have been trans for a long time Fifteen Years I'm actually at age thirty five I'm I Am past the point of average life expectancy for a trans person in America today [noise] um I think that I'm resilient and and strong and\nFor our country and for trans people that we would ever be loved in the way we deserve and all of those stories started to seep in one night I had a really horrible nightmare where I was giving birth not not to a baby but to a monster", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "20"}
