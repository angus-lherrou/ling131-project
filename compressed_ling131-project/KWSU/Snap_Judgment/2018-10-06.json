from ...\nHere than any live at the [noise]\nMy mom has a nickname for me uh bought in Cantonese\nStation and I had to suppress that curiosity asking\nAll of those questions because when you're born a kid of immigrants you're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on\nKeep your head down learn English\nGo to school get good grades go to college\nMary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kid by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet and\nSo these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them\nBecause I was born and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which was bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me\nMy mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad were six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brothers would take turns massaging his\nBack while I'm\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America\n[noise] and so I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents\nAnd if the U.S versus China and I asked my dad who are re rooting for [noise]\nI don't go well of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought I couldn't ask that\nQuestion though because when you're\nGrowing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause the rocket strike\nBut I found my way\nTo figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen I was\nExcited to watch a PBS documentary about me becoming American the experience [noise]\nI've seen three people who ever looked like me Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAnd moon line a cartoon character [noise] so I'm so excited to watch these last twenty minutes\nWhich talks about people marching and protesting people who looked like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all these people will go on the street and risk their identity theft\nIn Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American man who would be and said that\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers prices in Detroit\nOr Japanese companies were booming\nAnd people thought the Japanese were stealing their job they fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party [noise]\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest once his funeral and that the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Filipino people\nAre now saying if this happens to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American I never heard that term before and Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together\nSo my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching the documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points to screen she looks ... on and says\nThat your family what\nHave all these questions who is he how is he relate isn't easy like a cousin of a cousin of the cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met him because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish in her eyes\nShe didn't look like he had wanted to tell me that but I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how can I ask about\nA murder man and our family I had nothing to stay at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt or\nDo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking of articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and I can't find a single copy\nThe movie the movie featured heavily ... mother lowly Chicken Little each and when all over the nation on the Phil Donahue show crying out I Want justice for my son\nShe's featured at her house in the suburbs of Detroit feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes trying to set up the filmmakers a boyfriend\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue toys and ease\nAt some moments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back hurts hears\nBecause at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because this woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother and\nShe was rallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself I have to find out who will each in is because if ... is in the my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family I'm someone who spoke up\nTo be a spot again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know\nSo now I'm like I have to find out who will each\nIn it and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer that city where ... lived and died Detroit and I take an eight hour mega bus to Detroit\nMy friend picked me up and I ask her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery to Stevenson tens grave we she drives us and we find Vince engines name on a tombstone lowly tens name on the tombstone\n... husband's name on a tombstone they're no longer goals\nThey are right below my feet and I'm finally going to know how these people are related to me and why this means so much to me\nI go the next states in my relatives house we're eating swelled dishes of meals I'm looking through thirty photo albums with my family I see pictures of my mom and dad with matching terms in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd so I asked my relatives can you help me make a family tree I Want to know\nHad a brother and nine sisters\nThe second sister on this list is Long Beach and so now I Know they'll each in is my grandmother's sister lowly chin is my mother's birth on and Vincent Chin as my mother's first cousin\nSo I asked my eighth grade ... who what happens to lowly after Vincent Chin died\nShe tells me well when Vincent died slowly was all alone in Detroit\nSo your grandmother and I literally sisters flew to America from China to support her your mom and dad had married in China so your dad team soon after they all found work in New York and that's how your family ended up in Manhattan's Chinatown\nI thought about this for a while\nMy name is Elaine ...\nI became a published a newspaper columnist at the age of twelve a primarily because the editor didn't know how old I was he told my aunt when she delivered some news to the paper that he needed a columnist for\nThe neighborhood had
