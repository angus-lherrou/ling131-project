Twenty years after the Emmy winning sitcom went off the air CBS has revived it for an eleventh season Candice Bergen plays the older but still fast talking broadcast journalist who returns alongside the original cast\nNPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about it ... hey so Murphy Brown was always about mining politics for entertainment back in the day I'd had fans from both sides of the aisle Senator Orrin hatch\nRepublican of Utah even sending a head shot hoping to make a guest appearance [laughter] do you think you could have crossover appeal today or are they even making an effort no\nIn one word or you know I spoke to the show's creator and show runner Diane English in LA in July\nAnd basically she told me she didn't think they would be a show 'em there would be a revival uh if if Trump hadn't been elected president\nUm she was a how supportive of Hillary Clinton ran a pack um that was connected to her before the election had a huge party at our house ah\nAh for the election and had like two hundred bottles of champagne that she could no been when a Hillary Clinton didn't win and so uh seeing how they affect the Trump has had on politics on media especially ah she's got this show that features these people were supposed to be taught journalist\nSo of course pushing back against that has become one of the major themes in the revival of of Murphy Brown\nAnd because he's so close to Hillary Clinton of course she uh she got the former secretary of state or to actually make an appearance on the show so we've got a clip of that uh let's let's let's check\nAnd I also feel you've had previous secretarial which theory absolutely for four years I was the secretary [noise]\nI was a secretary at a very large organization [noise] and you have all the records of skills computer male female [noise]\nI I Do have some experience\nDeath [laughter] I don't think they would have brought up emails editor re um it ... you know Hillary Clinton has been having some fun she was she is also appeared in a an episode of Madam Secretary of you know that trauma\nUm alongside Colin Powell and I'm I'm a un and other political so I'm ... this show has been very much about pushing back against Trump ism the Murphy Brown revival\nAnd I'm In an in an episode um that just stared you know she sneaks into the White House briefing room and sort of pushes back against some of the things they do so this shows is very much about pushing back against Trump is pushing back against the monitor shape with a GOP so it it is not a bipartisan\nThat the original Murphy Brown went to war with Dan Quayle remember him a in a real life needs fiction moment during the Nineteen Ninety two presidential election Quayle made of family values speech where he criticized the character Murphy Brown for having a child outside of marriage then the character Murphy round responded to quilt criticisms in the show\nAnd now it seems like the show is trying to manufacture that same dynamic with President Trump\nYeah there there's a a there was a scene towards the end of the first episode of the revival where Trump was supposedly watching these fictional uh news characters on the air and tweeting about them and then they were reading the tweets in responding to him I think we have\n[noise] any time you were\n[noise]\n\nSo of course a reference to wear a Murphy actually a delivered a very effective response to Dan Quayle back in the heyday of the show\nI think it was interesting to me I'm a you know I had mixed feelings about this a revival uh I didn't I found some of the humor to be I'm kind of old fashioned and and some of the speeches fined by the Murphy Brown character to be kind of a dye tactic\nAnd in your face in a way that that uh that wasn't necessarily entertaining and and this bit at the end of the first episode of the revival felt like wishful thinking in a way like like you like you you like it kind of wish to show 'em ... these people making a kind of wish to show would be impactful enough\nThat Donald Trump would actually watch it in sort of tweet it them a while I was going on so uh so they actually made it happen within the confines of the show but um what's really happening is that there are so many people that had been saying things like this for so long on TV including\nKnow that it doesn't really feel like Murphy Brown is saying anything new um when when the show was originally doing this kind of commentary\nUh it's still different because there weren't a lot of shows that we're talking this way and they weren't a lot of sitcoms that were caught talking very directly about things that were happening in the world now all of that has changed and I think is left Murphy Brown feeling a little out of step with the times well what about\nThe idea also that this is yet another TV network show that is going for the ... factor and bringing back something that was there before\nYeah um I mean in a way this could feel like a like a step too far or some some of the other ... boots I'm from the way the viewers responded to them you had a sense that there was sort of a a pent up demand amongst fans when Roseanne came back\nWhatever you think of stars and bars politics um there's the audience responded by paying attention to the show and you had a sense that\nUh fans had kind of missed it and and with will and grace on NBC that revival the same thing now CBS is a little different CBS has done a lot of revivals of shows\nThat are sort of thinly veiled a revival is you know they have a magnum PI they have swat they have mcgyver and all of these are just kind of an excuse to take really predictable and run of the mill a procedural adventure stories and and and slap living near the show a over it so\nI'm you know those that have been under the radar in a way to get decent ratings but they're not the kind of phenomenon that will and grace\nAnd um and and Roseanne where I think CBS was trying to do that kind of phenomenon with Murphy Brown but the show hadn't been in syndication for a long time so\nI you know I don't think a lot of younger people leave a familiar with the show and because the the the revised version of it um it's still a little awkward and kind of old school I I think it's going to have a hard time finding new fans\nTo NPR TV critic Eric Deggans thank you thank you\nAgain to our top story today the Senate advancing vet Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination to a final vote tomorrow\nBut the allegations of drinking and sexual misconduct lived at Kavanaugh\nHas prompted soul searching at the kinds of elite prep school he attended ... decades ago colleges have been taking a hard look at how they may have committed a culture of drinking and sexual misconduct most can change in seasons back then but if you turn ... from the there's still a ways to go to many of us\nAnd as a student is painfully familiar\nI was deeply shaken and I just posted as anybody else having these really bad memories come up\nAlexandra less God's graduated from the national cathedral school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes she could forget\nThere was a drunk girl in a room um and there was a boy in there with her and there were other boys lined up outside the door and my friend recall hearing I'm next time next\nIt was such a toxic culture of power and privilege she says many guys didn't even try to hide it and schools knew how bad it was\nIn Nineteen Ninety the Washington Post reported that seven of them including Georgetown Prep\nWork Kavanaugh when centered joint warning to parents about the excessive drinking and sex ed unsupervised parties\nThey called it a recipe for disaster Georgetown Prep the current president declined to comment but in a recent letter to parents see bad to reevaluate school culture and to quote work with the guys on respect for women John Paul free is head of school at Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts\nThis has been a call to every educator I think and I think any school that isn't some gauge him soul searching was making a mistake\nSchools have already changed dramatically since the eighties Paul free says driven by evolving attitudes and society at large stand by a student body that's no longer so exclusively the privileged and powerful and he says students are now schools on what he calls a culture of consent\nAnd respect it is changing but it's still a problem on campuses and I certainly can't say that we are out of the woods yet\nSandy just three years ago saying all been school in D.C had to ... college yearbooks after discovering seniors at the elite all boys school had included crude and sexist slurs\nThat's way too recent this is very disturbing\nAttorney Eric leash represents victims of sexual assault that has also saying all been alone\nThat tells me that there's an issue with that school is really indefensible\nSaying all the ins declined to comment but in a letter to parents alumni the school apologized for the incidents and vowed to learn from past mistakes Paul free from Philips Andover some schools have been quicker than others to get what the

that's according to the Labor Department which also reported today the U.S employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month Michael Reagan a senior editor\nA thousand that was actually below expectations but continues a long long long streak of job growth tell us more about what we learned in the report today well right as you\nMentioned it was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty five thousand jobs so yeah this is about fifty thousand below that but it's a very tough month to get right because of Hurricane Florence um ... you know a lot of companies\nBut that might have been planning to hire would postpone it and a lot of companies were just you know it's more or less laying people off\nTemporarily because of the weather so they're actually about three hundred thousand people a away from work to to the bad weather so it's you know most economists are kind of looking past that disappointment in the number of jobs added due to the weather\nUm and it just assuming that the same trends we've seen of of pretty healthy job growth a is still intact\nAnd what about that unemployment rate the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nAbsolutely yeah and ah you know Larry Kudlow today saying he he wouldn't be surprised to see it go even further I mean it just goes to a show as you said this economic recovery is still ongoing um since two thousand and ten or ... the the nation is that a jobs every single month Ninety six months straight\nUm and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment\nWhen we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers for the holidays because the unemployment rate is so low people are able to get\nJobs I this is totally anecdotal but I was at a coffee shop this morning huge line not nearly enough people are are ... are we at the point now where the issue is that companies just can't find enough people that want the jobs\nI you know to to give you an addict out of my own I just noticed that a lot of my friends nannies are are quitting because of the employment prospects for them or are good so what does it all sort of\nAdds up to this notion that the employment market is very strong now a ... it's still not doing what a lot of people were afraid it would do is which is overheat the economy and cause wages to accelerate aggressively um that's not quite the case yet um but it's it by all accounts are very very strong job market\nWhat did we learn today about wages\nThey continued to increase the year every year a gain in average hourly hourly earnings was about two point eight percent or so a nice game but I cannot\nTurn things the other way cause corporate profit margins to to shrink and that sort of thing it's still sort of steady as she goes uh considering the trends we saw a first for many years now we're back to back through the uh beginning of the recovery from the recession\nWas going to be interesting to see how the Federal Reserve takes this news and we're already up to a to into court two to two and a quarter percent interest rate on the federal funds rate will see Mike we're going to Bloomberg News thank you thanks German\nOf President Trump is touting those new jobs numbers on Twitter and a strong economy also came up in his rally yesterday in Rochester, Minnesota where he threw his weight into one of the most highly contested congressional races in the country for an open seat in Minnesota is first [noise]\nIt's supposed to be a Democrat\nVery surprised gum and\nHoping that that surprises at\nThe Republican Jim how you doing when he's facing the Democrat Dan ... both are vying to fill a seat left open by democratic representative Tim Walz who's running for governor\nSo that district is where we turn to this week's district profile cats and Richard is senior reporter for Minnesota Public radio she joins us from Rochester and Catherine Minnesota went for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen\nBut the first district went for President Trump's so tell us more about the district itself\nWell it's kind of a funny district if you look at it in the long picture um it's been traditionally conservative and Republican it's a very rural so there's a lot of you know smaller agricultural communities and the district outside of Rochester ... which are started the city had\nThat being said during the Obama administration Tim Walz won his reelection pretty handily up until twenty six team and he was almost defeated by Republican Jim Hackett orange and of course the district went handily for president Donald Trump at the time\nRight well let's take a look at the two candidates the Democrat Dan ... worked in the Obama administration he's an Iraq War vet a member of the Democratic farmer labor party which is a line the Democrats and in this recent ad he built himself as an independent voice\nIn the army you can put any differences aside and come together to accomplish incredibly brave thing and that's exactly what the Congress or\nI'm not taking over ... so that means nothing leader corporation\nRichard tell us more about seeing [noise] well I think\nOr um he hasn't lived in Minnesota since he was a teenager actually and his opponents are frequently point that out though he's moved back to the districts are run\n'em I think what you're hearing there is his willingness to work across the aisle which is really important in this district which you know in the best case for Democrats as a moderate district and you know so you hear him running a pretty moderate campaign and it's really an echo two of the types of campaigns that Tim Walz around here\nWell none of the Republican Jim had to door in his reason add he talks about growing up on a farm in Minnesota doing a lot of reading which of course he brings to his thoughts on Washington\nWashington the whims of government are so certain rather than a Trump pulled\nThe guy with the health and rip out the regulations Obamacare and those are\nSo Catherine we hear him aligning themselves with President Trump what's the thought on that\nWell he is then aligning himself with Trump's views before Trump was really even on the scene remember he's run for three times for the seat so he has been running on a very similar platform for far longer than Trump has been you know campaigning\nUm and I think that plays well with certain aspects of the district\nAnd is playing very well this time because of the fact that the district favor Donald Trump in the last election I think that things to know about ... joined that are interesting or the his dad actually held the seat and so he moved to Washington DC when he was a teenager and lived there\nFor a long time and actually worked there for a long time so just like his opponent Dan Finn he has lived outside of the district for quite awhile worked in various administrations worked on Capitol Hill and has more recently come back to the districts to run again these three times\nSo those are the two candidates cats or I'm going to ask you about another thing that President Trump said last night that jumped out he really dissed for Minnesota Senator Al Franken for in the president's ah words kind of quitting after Franken was accused of inappropriate behavior\nBe that many felt was kind of minor compared to some of the the accusations we've\nBeen hearing about in the me too movement but Franken pull themselves out of politics and the president seemed to be saying he was kind of a a coward for that yeah it was\nWas an interesting point that he made and I'm Still sort of sorting through what he was getting out because on one hand he said you know Franken was kind of a wet rag he he took responsibility for what he was doing and he\nLeft office of course under great pressure from his own party let's not forget that and this is being set against the backdrop of what's happening in Washington did today which is this\nThey're um he is taking responsibility for his actions\nBut of course keep in mind that when Frank and laughed we you know the governor here appointed a Democrat to take his place who's now running for reelection and it's effectively opened up a potential seat for Republicans\nSo on one hand he's criticizing it seemed Franken for leaving so quickly but on the other hand it's presented in opportunity for his party most fascinating but how is the whole cabinet debate\nImpacting if it is this race or is it just falling along party lines [noise]\nYou know I think generally it's falling along party lines when I spoke to people who are waiting to get into the rally yesterday this is something I asked them about all of them said you know we want him to talk about judge Kavanaugh we support judge Kavanaugh\nBut will it sort of weird was that people said you know we believe that something bad happened to Dr Christine Blasey Ford so many years ago we just don't think it was him because he doesn't seem like the type of person who would do that uh they called it a witch hunt they said that you know that she knew she may be missed remembering", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "05"}
