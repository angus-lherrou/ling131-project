the voice of a Supreme Court justice a because last friday on September twenty sevens and just the day after a Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIt just so happened that justice Elena Kagan was speaking at a University of California Los Angeles law school for them\nNow or I should know I watched the whole forum it was an about an hour and a half long and Brett Kavanaugh name was not mentioned once uh neither by Justice Kagan or by the UCLA moderator\nIt's as close as we're going to get to knowing what's inside the minds of justice is right now and there was this really interesting moment where dean men who can ask Justice Kagan about the lessons that the justices had learned when they only had eight members on the bench after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia\nAnd Alina Kagan said the courses a real interest in preserving its institutional legitimacy and then she said this\nThe courts strength as an institution of American governance depends on and having a certain kind of legitimacy on people believe in that\nIt is I'm not simply an extension of politics but it's it's decision making has a kind of integrity to what that is something different from what you find in the political branches\nAnd if if people don't believe that they have no reason to accept what the court does and that would be a great shame that one of the beauties of our system of governance is that\n[noise]\n[noise] support for on point comes from homemade visor matching homeowners with home improvement professional for a variety of

is becoming more politicized over time I'm joined today by Stuart Taylor the author and contributing editor for the national journal Dahlia Lithwick is also with us She's court and law courts and reporter for slate and host of the advocates pod cast as well\nAnd I want to just go through a kind of a little walk through a through history here in in terms of moments for different nominees where politics definitely came into play a first of all let's go back to Nineteen eighty seven here then Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork in a press conference in October\nTwo days after the Senate Judiciary committee voted to have his nomination put before the full Senate with a recommendation not to consent to the appointment\nAnd obviously a rubber ... ended up not being a elevated to the high court and here he talks about the lasting effect of the politics involved in his nomination\nThe most serious and was being injury and all of this is not for me nor is it to all of those who have steadfastly supported by nomination\nAndrew Marr I'm deeply grateful [noise]\nRather the damage\nTo the ... the integrity of law and a public service in this country\nRobert Bork in October Nineteen eighty seven fast forward than to October Nineteen Ninety One and here is then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas addressing the Senate Judiciary committee about his confirmation hearing this was a circus some national disgrace\n[noise] from my standpoint [noise]\nIn any way dangerous thing though to do for themselves have different ideas that it is a message that unless you count town to the old order\nThis is what will happen\nClarence Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One no moves forwards still to Merrick Garland who President Obama nominated and um we can't plenty tape there because he never even got a hearing\nSo that takes us then to where we are now two thousand Eighteen and just last week present a Brett Kavanaugh defended himself before the Senate Judiciary committee\nAre claiming that Democrats had politicize this process and developed quote a long series of false last minute smears to block his nomination\nThis whole to reach out for as a child you later an orchestrated political hair\nFueled with our parents turn off the anger about President Trump and the two thousand such gene or watch and fear that has been unfairly stoked about more judicial record revenge on behalf of the coins\nAnd millions of dollars for money from outside left wing opposition groups\nDo all this week hoping ... you with us now yeah I'm here great\nDo you think you so much so so let me just ask you hearing sort of those voices through history is what we heard last week with Brett Kavanaugh categorically different than the politics that came before in previous nominations\nI you know I think it was a I think that it it's a funny it's there's some perfect symmetry we started with Robert Bork what Robert Bork did at his hearing that was\nProbably tactically a mistake when he talked to really\nIn Folsom clear and very very certain ways about his own views there's a reason that people stopped doing that after Bork and learn to say I'm just a robot in a neutral umpire so in a sense what Robert Bork was being\nA barked over was in fact how he thought about judging how he thought about the constitution then when you fast forward to last week and judge Kavanaugh you have a very very strange almost the mirror image where since then there's\nThis long tradition of judges including judges by the way with\nVery very very extensive legal records um records of writings records of speeches and communications and records of their actual ... views standing up and saying but I'm also just a robot a I have no use malls and\nClose to a truthful scrutiny\nOf someone's record now what we have this\nTiny pantomime where the nominee pretend that they actually have no kids at all and nothing they wrote in the past had any bearing and I think that sets up a what we saw this week which is you have a nominee who has a very very clear very coherent\nThat channel record and he spent most of the hearing trying to get away from it now\nThat doesn't answer the question of whether Brett Kavanaugh did something really dramatically different when he started talking about dark money in the Clinton because I think that's a given I've never seen anything like that\nBut I think at least Bork was honest and he was\nWhen the Senate exercised it's at five and content it did send knowing yeah that's gone\nWell Stuart Taylor I mean I guess the the question that naturally rated itself here is is the court being undermined by what is fundamentally seen by many as a broken nomination and confirmation process that proceeds any justices elevation to the high court\nEmphatically yes and I've been watching it happen and get worse and worse and worse since before\nA judge Bork ... a year before judge Bork Justice Scalia who was then a very controversial figure was confirmed like Ninety eight zero I think or maybe it was Ninety eight to two\nOh I think was hero a Bork I understand why the Democrats didn't want him to get confirmed because his record shows that he was going to be bad for them and almost every issue and even then what I said earlier was troops\nAh everything you know they're they're deciding many of the most important political issues in the country you can argue it's almost impossible not to be a neutral arbiter when that's what you're doing\nThe what the Democrats did with a Bork and and what made worker blurb\nWas they smears him in every conceivable way except to sex life\nThey smeared him as a liar as a monster they portrayed him as a horrible person they took out advertising it was a disgusting display you know that this was how they thought they could win now with Thomas was more complicated\nWith a cabin on who you know for all of all of the comments lately and understandable comments about his odd performance in front of the committee\nOr he's been on the bench for twelve years at the second highest court in the land arguably sitting along with Fifteen admirable judges including my law school friend Merrick Garland and we know what happened to him\nI have it on good authority and it's pretty public that every one of those judges\nIn terms of judicial temperament and level headed smart wonderful colleagues who are you know who is much more conservative and most and some of them in some ways but he was an excellent tone yeah you know now that's not what he looks like the person was on TV the other day was totally out of character\nFor a job and all in this process I think a drone that\nWell and and and uh do you all this week I mean we're we're creeping towards looking at Congress has rule in all of this I mean there's the politics that play out between Democrats and Republicans in those hearings themselves\nBut also I mean after Harry Reid first you know wants the nuclear option or push the nuclear option button into them Thirteen and then Mitch McConnell did it after the Supreme Court nominees in two thousand Seventeen\nThat removed you know what was the most effective break in terms of bringing more controversial justices to uh you know to the nomination process right so I mean we have to be looking at the Senate and and its role here\nIn creating highly politicized environment for the court\nI I don't think there's any question I think that the fact that we're talking about what one two votes were talking about Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and the totality\nOf this seat rests on one or two people's votes it it really I mean I couldn't agree more with Stewart that you know justices Ginsburg and Justice Scalia\nOften uh say are set in ... case look this used to be a Ninety eight nothing seems to be a Ninety four nothing enterprise because of the rule\nThat everybody at here too in the Senate was\nElections matter and if the president chooses someone who's fit we don't go after them because of perceived outcomes and that's clearly\nJust gone or I Would probably say that\nThe the holding of Merrick Garland seat open and in fact\nI Would say the running on the proposition right because Ted Cruz\nAnd John McCain ran in the twenty sixteen election for their Senate seats on the open promise that we will keep that seat open not only is Merrick Garland not getting a hearing but if Hillary Clinton wins we will hold the seat open for four years or eight years that seat is not\n[noise]\nSupport for on point comes from exact science is offering colon guide for average risk

legitimacy the integrity\nAnd the public trust in the United States Supreme court and I'm joined today by Dahlia Lithwick Stuart Taylor and Christopher Schmidt and I want to play just a couple of clips here uh this is against this is from last week\nA and first of all you're going to hear Republican Senator Lindsey Graham I'm being asked by a reporter is uh the hearings that were held on Thursday could have an impact on the republic\nLooking at allegation is thirty five years old so uncertain time plays\nDate and no cooperation if that's enough for you God help us all as Republicans cost this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends this is the new norm\nYou better watch out for your nominee\nSenator Lindsey Graham last week at last week's confirmation hearing Senator Ben Sasse Republican from Nebraska said that all the recent quote hysteria is because the Supreme Court nominations have become so politicized\nWe have a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court in American Life now\nOur political commentary talks about the Supreme Court like there are people wearing red and blue jerseys that's a really dangerous thing and by the way if they have red and blue jerseys I Would welcome my colleagues introduced legislation that ends lifetime tenure for the judiciary\nBecause if they're just politicians and the people should have power and they shouldn't have lifetime appointment\nThat's Republican Ben Sasse last week it was way before the break ahead to interrupt you there so that we could take a break but you were talking about the fact that people are seeing politics and the nomination process but they don't actually get a chance to see in great detail the court doing its actual work and the consequences of that\nAnd that's right and in some sense I think senator Sasse put it better than I did um you know if you all you see is people in red and blue jerseys and the Senate turning it into a blood sport about getting a red or blue justice on it's a little bit hard to say the public isn't going to take that away with them\nUm and I think you know the only other thing I Would add is we've been talking about the public perception\nOf the justices but I think it's probably worth just threading into the conversation the justices own view of these things we know for instance that Clarence Thomas never fully recovered from what he thinks was done to him and his hearings we know that Sam Alito has\nSaid that he never quite forgiving forgotten how his hearings went down it's really hard to imagine that\nIf Brett Kavanaugh as elevated to the court\nHe will look at some of the groups that are attacked him\nIn anything resembling a an objective open minded way so there are real consequences not just for public perception of the justices but the justices\nA perception that the public and that's something that I think we really do have to factor into the conversation ...\nI'm going to get to some colors 'cause we've got folks who've been waiting patiently on the line but Christopher Schmidt I just want to ask you a quick question here because uh I mean it isn't there\nWe are just records in the decisions that they make\nThat perhaps I don't know if it's fair to say politics already plays a role in how the court operates but that one can wonder if that's true when we had justices that are much more often than not um you know voting in line with the with what would be perceived\nA preferred vote of the president that ... that nominated then I put them on the court to begin with\nYeah this is absolutely true but it's also nothing new we knew this before Brett Kavanaugh came on the scene\nOf the nominees and the Supreme Court that politics play a role it's always played a role in some sense and also say if you look at the American people's attitude toward the court most people actually don't think that the court does not involve itself in politics and politics and placements or on the court\nAnd people oftentimes do have an ability to say yes there are politics at play here um but the court still has legitimacy even independent of that so it's not the idea that once people see it as in some way to political institution automatically its legitimacy is lost and no longer people are going to solve dictates\nWell let's go to college here finally and thank you everyone for for waiting patiently on the line let's go to Aaron who's calling from Detroit Michigan you're on the air Erin\nHi thank you for taking my call very interesting topic I Want to get to see and so I'm almost be through it first of all um the the point or question is has the legitimacy and integrity or public trust but the last\nTwo perception and if you think about what happened with a Obama not being able to appoint a a justice to repent replace Scalia because of Republican saying we will not let him do it\nThat politicized it in the public's right now we know that the American public is probably the most uh propagandize uh easily manipulated a populist in modern history and so through the media and through a lot of other things they are a given a perception of what is and what is not but\nTo the last several months from Donald Trump and his\nA blatant disregard for for for the constitution and Republicans with this film down we're going to do this regardless because we're Republicans Oregon go against whatever Democrats saying that a lot of law\nI think the public trust has been shaken and I believe the integrity or is gone and I believe like one of the other uh uh statements were made that we need to put some kind of limits on terms now because this is simply a political position\nErin thank you for your call call Stuart Taylor um\nTerm limits of justice says well I think term limits as a wonderful idea I thought that for twenty or Thirty years\nOr maybe eleven years maybe Fifteen Years in and out the problem is it'll never happen\nBecause it would require ... maybe a constitutional amendment to even getting it through Congress\nOr the the calculations by the political people who could decide whether to have tournaments are are going to be who's going to be helped who's going to be heard who's gonna who's who's people or older [laughter]\nYou know who's terms or later ... is it going to help the the red team of the blue team and they're always be a calculation where if one side thinks it's going to be a good thing for their team the other side will think it's going to be a bad thing\nAnd neither side is gonna care much about the herring merits of term limits which are good you know people shouldn't be sitting on the Supreme Court for forty years\nUm but that's what's going I think that's what we're going to be seen from ... for a long time well\nLet's go to truly who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the train\nAnd thank you very much uh I Will remind people Lindsey Graham supported taken for Obama and the uh keep in mind that the ... the Supreme Court's role is to make the wrongs of the government\nAgainst its people fixed so I think uh this is an injustice for uh the the nominee that what he's going through thank you very much\nTroy thank you for your call let's go to Joe who's calling from Tampa, Florida you're on the Joe\nI I'm I guess well I figured that I called the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the question was going up or go out when I realized that it was only up to a couple of justice is whether or not I got the right to marry my dad\nAnd now I'm kind of thing that play out a gang where there's a lot of the reasons I could come up and it's not even that it's a light left ideology it seems like it's more playing down to um the ... the right is actually just a code word for religious\nSo it's a bunch of religious people on the right who want to overturn roe even though that may be impossible by some standard\nThey still want to do it and they're willing to sacrifice anything to be able to even get that chance when in reality there is no scientific reason to do it there is no scientific reason you are prohibited gay people are married it's just about ... what religious doctrine is actually going to sway the massive ...\nYeah well Jill thank you for your call a deli it looks like he has a response to that [noise]\nYeah I mean I think you know just gave us the ants\nAs insert itself into all the big ticket issue that the day excuse me and I think you know what you just heard was the Supreme Court was by design supposed to be a counter majorities Harry and check it was supposed to fight for the rights\nOf minorities or when the other branches of government may have wanted to impose their will on ... that's what a burger felt was that what brown the board was um and it's very very hard to say oh we want the court to stay out of the big ticket battles the hot button social issues because in some sense the court is really the only defense", "year":
