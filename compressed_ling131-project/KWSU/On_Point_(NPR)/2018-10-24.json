happened and why that series was co reported by Jessica silver Greenberg and ... and they'd be joining us today and we also want to hear from\nFrom you do you think that we're plays accommodations for expecting mothers have gotten better in the forty years since the first law about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace was passed did you ask for combinations from your employer uh and got them\nOr were you even afraid to ask concerned about whether or not I'm having your work changed because of your pregnancy might affect your job or possibly even lead\nTo your dismissal were at one eight hundred for two three eight to ...\nIf you if you're an employer how much combination can you make and what are the realistic concerns and employers have about the limits too accommodating employees during pregnancy again we're at eight hundred for two or three to five five\nNow I just want to play a little tape for you because there are a lot of stories out there you're going to hear from Heather Myers she was working at a Wal Mart in Kansas and two thousand six when she discovered she was pregnant she talked to NPR in twenty fourteen about it\nAnd she said that while her doctor had recommended that she keep a water bottle with her on the wall Mart sales for\nHer supervisor did not approve so Myers went back to her doctor got a note to give to her supervisor\nShe said I'm Sorry that we can't accept your doctors now because we have\nWater I don't see because you have the water fountains available to you I was just a little shocked that this water bottle is kind of having this big deal\nAnd they read and scrutinizing my doctor that I decided to go against what my supervisor suggested and listen to my doctor and to my body\nAnd decided to keep the water bottle and one day that they provide your came up to me and she said either the water bottle has to go or you'd have to go\nThat's how they're Myers she spoke with NPR in two thousand fourteen now just because silver Greenberg and Natalie ... ah in the course of your reporting\nHow did you were you surprised by um the number of stories that you've found or whether it's still difficult to get women to come forward to talk about discrimination that they felt a big head experience in the workplace while they were pregnant so\nI think we were surprised when we first started reporting this story by just how common to experience was when you start something like this we had been looking for something that might be impacting women the way that me too\nHas and we were shocked at the outpouring of\nSort of varies similar experiences from women all the way up and down the economic ladder and blue collar jobs in low wage jobs in office jobs for this most recent story and miscarriage\nI can say that uh we went to Texas together I mean to Texas to to Memphis to gather 'em\nAnd uh we had\nIn many cases go back to the same women over and over and over again and really\nTheir life so in the case of a miscarriage or really deeply affecting health experience it was difficult to get people to talk to us\nYeah and and I imagine that the extreme difficulty that the women who were you know ultimately willing to speak to that they're extreme difficulty was compounded by the fact that I Would guess almost all of them really needed the jobs they were in radio it wasn't as if they had\nA the freedom or the means to just say okay well if you're not going to accommodate me I'll go find another employer\nRight and they also needed the health insurance that came with those jobs they were there ... yeah\nExactly um so it was a paycheck and it was also health insurance and again just and I talk to people who were still working at the warehouse so these are folks who are at again great personal risk\nComing forward to tell their stories um when you know it could risk their job right now I Want\nTo get to the bigger picture here but it but I should note that uh the the warehouse company that use that many of these women or all the women in their mid your second story most of them that where they work\nDid the company not also said that the dispute the allegations because of uh currently though their attempts to unionize uh employees at the warehouse\nYes they they did say that they said that um they said they believed that these\nAllegations were manufactured drummed out an exaggerated by the Teamsters Union which is currently trying to organize a the warehouse what we found so there's a couple of points to kind of mentioned yet\nNone of so with the exception of one one and I'm Tasha morale who ultimately left the warehouse on and has become an an organizer with the Teamsters\nNone of the women were affiliated with the union at all and so none of the women who use their names were affiliated with the union at all\nAnd you have to put the denial 'em by ... pm and pointing the Teamsters in a broader context which is they made a lot of denials some of which we included on the record so we\nAnd it comes down to a pretty basic I'm a pretty basic set of disputed\nAnd window is they just keep the company disputed the description of window is pointing out that while the warehouse has no exterior windows it has a number of interior windows\nSo they don't totally seed sunlight or daylight there just inside the building\nRight there are windows that I'm I'm not exactly sure what interior windows they're describing I Believe that those exist but when you're when you're evaluating the credibility of a statement I think you need and the credibility of a denial I Do think you have to look at the facts that they are disputing that are smaller than\nSay you know whether or not a woman had a miscarriage on the floor\nI mean I'm sitting in a radio studio right now there's an interior window I can see out into the whole way of our radio station\nBut yes I Am in a similar studio I can also see hot into a into a room okay I'm In is working\nSo you know what I Want to get into sort of the uh the legal framework that all of this is going on in you know across the country here and just a minute with both of you just cut and deadly but we have a lot of callers who want to join us let me just let's get some of their story than if I can so let's go to Joanna who's calling from Edmond, Oklahoma joined a year on the air\nYes Hi Hi go ahead [noise]\nUm well my experience was I just wanted to kind of share because it hit home um I was working for oil and gas about six years ago when I became pregnant with our first son\nAnd um because I was I'm a private contractor I couldn't well I wasn't fired but I was let go as soon as it I'm kind of became known that I was pregnant and um\nI guess the only the biggest thing is it was the only other girl and the woman in the office was the only one to help me bring my chair down like two or three ... three stories\nI'm as well as all my other things and all these other men were just sitting there and what I thought were like at least co workers like a friend level on that level\nIt it didn't prove to be and it just makes me so sad that actually I just saw that friend of mine and she's pregnant and she is now an attorney a title attorney and she's having the same problems and so it's still very relevant and I don't know if it's just oil and gas the good old boy kind of thing but\nI just really hope and pray that\nBall you know you see the day that men really want to look out for their women to just help us\nWell doing it and do the work\nAnd I work nights and I live new chef for a newspaper and I'm throughout the years of the company I worked down to only one night a week and while I was pregnant with my first born I'm actually during while I was finding out the sex of the child um I was
