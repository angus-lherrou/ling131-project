showers will stop tonight I today in the upper fifties pillow or sixties [noise]\n\nFrom WVU are Boston and NPR I make the upper body and this is on point\nEven with the U.S out of the Paris climate agreement the global community pledged to keep the planet from warming by more than one and a half degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels but a new report from the international panel on climate change find that it may be so much harder than previously thought to reach that goal\nNothing less than they put rapid and far reaching transformation of human civil\nIPC morning we have reached the pivotal moment [noise]\nIf we do not change course in the next two years we risk runaway climate change\nThis hour on point that new climate report and humanities purging new deadline and you can join us what do you make a VIP cc's report scientists are saying rapid changes on a civilization all scale are needed\nIs that even possible especially now that the United states government has stepped away from the Paris Agreement what do you want to hear from the White House\nFrom the EPA after this report where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk you can also join us anytime it I'll point radio dot org or on Twitter and Facebook at on point radio\nWill join me first today from Washington is Chris Mooney he covers climate change energy and the environment for the Washington Post and we have links to his recent reporting at some point radio dot org Chris welcome to the program\nThank you so first of all give us a some of the top line details of what the scientists in a in this IPC the report are paying are they saying that one and a half degrees is not a reasonable goal anymore\nWell they very carefully do not take a stand on that question but they do\nClearly showed that it will be extremely difficult in order to do it essentially you have to do something that humanity hasn't done before which is radically change a major systems how we get energy how we get food how we get around transportation how we build our cities\nSo they once they've described the magnitude of what's required it's reasonable to ask whether it can be done\nOkay so the Paris climate agreement that uh of holding warming to a one and a half degrees or above ... over pre industrial levels was considered to be pretty ambitious to begin with\nSo I mean water scientists saying that we would need ... for a few are scientists staying that current practices and current plans to meet that goal or not enough uh unequivocal\nYou they're saying that so they're saying that current promises made by countries which they made as part of the Paris Agreement process\nWill give us three degrees Celsius so over five degrees Fahrenheit of warming by the end of the century uh than they prepared this report that we are now discussing saying what would have to be done in order to just limited to one\nUgly radical fast action just to give you some numbers\nThe world currently a myth about forty billion plus tons of carbon dioxide gas\nPer year that would have to be cut almost in half by twenty thirty so just twelve years so you do the math it has to be over a billion tons of cuts per year then you look at the countries of the world um that's more than almost every country emits every year there's only about five\nSupport for on point comes from exact science is offering colder guard for average risk dumped over fifty a non invasive colon cancer\nTree the polls coming out of sight out of the air and this doesn't exist now so people have been trying to imagine it in studies and in climate models and one of the ways in which they have imagined it a involves planting huge essentially plantations\nOf trees are crops in using those for energy but making sure that you capture the emissions that are released when they were burned and put those in the ground so that you're sucking carbon dioxide out of the air into the plant and then pulling it into the ground and getting energy along the way\nThis is what he referred to as bio energy combined with carbon capture and storage but there's this huge problem which is that you needed an enormous area of land\nTo do this and land has other uses like growing food are still what they're saying is that we might need so much land to pull carbon out of the year that it might compete with the need to feed of the world's growing population\nIntrusion now that sounds like a a very sobering zero sum game\nYeah you know I I think that taking the risk that we can emit more carbon now and we will make up for it later by pulling it out of the air\nIs akin to you know buying a new house on a credit card and hoping that eventually you'll get a better job and be able to pay for it you know this has enormous gamble with the future of our whole planet and and I think you know where they're turning over a large portion of our arable land\nTo grow crops to to burn them\nAnd to use a large portion of our water to grow those crops in our fertilizer\nHas enormous implications for biodiversity inability to defeat the planet and so if we cut our missions much more rapidly and we do have scenarios that do this and the report\nWe do not need to rely on this kind of technological carbon removal you can get away with only planting trees a kind of carbon removal that we already know about and is relatively benign but that requires\nThe most aggressive Kurt cuts in carbon if any of that scenario is we explored\nBut just to be clear I mean as Chris was saying ... with some of that tree planting globally or be taking place on Arab land that would otherwise be needed for you know to feed the extra two billion people that we expect to be added to the world's population in the next several decades\nThat would generally be restoring abandoned land marginal lands on how we could if we keep the reliance on these negative admissions at its lowest possible levels which\nCompromising most of our arable land\nOkay I Want to get to um the uh the the emissions cutting for nearly aggressive emissions cutting scenario that you're talking about uh they ended up there and just a second but we do have a lot of callers who want to join us and obviously this is an ... an issue with that that affects us also let me just get to them a Mars calling from East Lansing Michigan you're on the air\n[noise] Hi my question [noise] sorry my question is when the people that are profiting from the destruction\nOf environment like oil barons or whatnot when will they be held accountable like the conversation very scary but I never hear anything that's going to make money off of [noise]\nAnd so what I mean when you say accountability what are you asking for\nOur taxes or something to find program or the thing the the action taken\nSo you would like carbon taxes or income tax it I'm just I'm just trying to get a sense of what you're hoping for\nI'm I'm thinking in that there is something that people make billions of oil\nOkay Chris Mooney I mean among the first of all thank you for your call and of course many do you have a response from her for her as\nWell [noise] I don't know I I Would I Would put it a little differently I mean this is climate change\nIs the consequence of industrial civilization is the consequence of all of us\nAre deciding you adopt the technologies that we created um that make our lives better or driving you know cheating your home cooling your home and many many other things eating food that comes from a very far away\nAnd we often forget that every one of those things has this side effect which is that it takes energy and to get that energy is mostly burn fossil fuels so the way that we live\nAnd the scale at which we are using energy is really what's at stake here um so yes there's companies that sell energy at this point a lot of them are are actually fully accepting of the science and trying to find ways to do it differently um\nSo ... do pick up on that thought because I mean I think Christmas is exactly right this is an indictment of modern civilization and so if that's the very thing that we're staying needs to be changed rapidly how is that possible well ...\nIs an indictment and in some sense of people's choices and people consuming too much red meat and you know people using more energy than they need but I I Believe that this really\nAnd those who are have been pushing aggressively and recently succeeding in getting regulations\nAre rolled back and so you take something like release of methane from the natural gas industry and this was a measure that would nearly pay for itself because methane is the main component of natural gas they would capture more of their own product\nAnd they said it would cost them a little bit of money so they got the Trump Administration to push that a regulation back\nIt would almost pay for itself with out even counting for the environmental costs so what's happening in reality\nIs that we all pickup these costs you know more than a hundred billion a year in disaster relief expenditures everybody's health care premiums go up when people suffer from heat waves and suffer from air pollution and so\nThese companies really are profiting\nBy imposing a hidden tax on every other part of American business and American consumers and I think until we do change that like something you said many non carbon tax that really reflects the true cost of these activities we're not going to make the shift that aren't necessarily\nLet's go to Larry who's calling from middle field Connecticut Larry you're on the air\nI I'm just wanted to mention that I work for an electric or a company in national company and\nAlthough we pulled out of the climate agreement Paris which I disagree with and um [noise]\nThe government itself is spending billions of dollars upgrading for energy efficiency and conservation I mean from Fort Greely Alaska down to told an air force base in Florida are going solar where it can and upgrading or\n[noise]\nPort for on point comes from definitely envy you are often and constant contact who's email marketing to help small businesses a nonprofit connect with our customers learned more in constant contact dot com\nAnd guy come offering motorcycle and RV insurance more information available on motorcycle and RV insurance Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate bar ... we're talking about the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change is new report\nAbout what the future will hold if we continue emitting carbon dioxide into the air the rates that we are now and how much of a change civilization middle level change humanity is going to have to undergo in order to get a hold on a climate effects or carbon the facts on on the climate\nSo I Want to play a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski he's lead author of the eye PCC report he was in South Korea yesterday saying that now the government that scientists have sounded the alarm its governments that have to decide what to do about the grim forecast\nThe messages we've told you the scientific fact the evidence the call\nToday so let's roll back the clock a little bit and go back to December two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump here's what he said about global warming\nIs talking about\nAll of this was the global warming and a lot of the house to house I mean it's a money making industry okay fish out\nThat's December two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump or of course Mr Trump and now president of the United states ... your author one of the authors on yesterday's reports\nUh I mean we're two and a half years out from when Donald Trump said those things about global warming but in light of what has just been written what do you think about what are the president's attitude was about global warming\nWell unfortunately well he's now live all the same things well outside of what many in his party would say that's a really quite a common view for most of the Republican Party and it didn't used to be this way even a few decades ago both parties supported environmental\nProtection and now it is just become in particular since the passage of the since the Citizens United decision with unlimited campaign finance without anonymous campaign finance\nIt's more and more of the Republican Party at least it appears to be beholden to the fossil fuel industry and now they're they're touting things like creating coal jobs even though renewables create more jobs than does coal and even though\nI'm coldest is going away not because of government forces but because of the other fields just being cheaper because of market forces so there there's really this this narrative from the Republican Party\nThat's wildly inconsistent with both the facts and the majority of Americans public opinion or even the marketplace ...\nChris Mooney have we heard an official response from the Trump Administration from the state department or a firm about a response to the PCs report [noise]\nYes we have statements from the state department and also I'm from ... acting administrator Andrew wheeler um in our story actually um and we'll or you know ... one of our journalist asked him what it would take to keep the world to ... below a dangerous level of climate change and ah he didn't identify specific level but he pointed out\nUm that what BP is doing right now would\nHelp um help to lead to continue innovation and clean coal technologies 'em and these technologies will be exported to other countries\nThey're saying that because this report quarterly targets colon says we're gonna have to burn a lot less coal maybe phase out entirely in what they're saying is actually\nNo we need to create technologies that captured the emissions of calling Barrett blow the ground um so that's one of the angles a that is being taken on the report um [noise]\nYeah I'm seeing here that a State Department official I'm as you're reporting that said that\nGovernments do not formally indoors specific findings presented by the authors\nAre and that and the person went on to say though that from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen us carbon ... related emissions declined by fourteen percent while global energy related carbon emissions rose by Twenty one present during the same time so touting us efforts to to cut emissions there [noise]\nWell and it's it's not incorrect us emissions have gone down um they haven't gone down as much as would be needed a for the world to be on track for one point five degrees Celsius [noise] All right let's take another call here breed is calling from Baltimore, Maryland Bree you're on the air\n[noise] high magnitude um [noise] I just had um a couple um I I guess more like a question flash comment on I think making a significant changes manageable for the average person is\nProbably our best\nHope of of actually making change so high and it's like a cute kid playing like the ... than\nThat um you know sort of blew up on social media and ah you know people really ran with it unfortunately it's not enough to make a dent on and on the problems that we have in the environment or\nBut it you know it's even eating at you know taking one day a week or we don't send me from one day is that enough to make a change yeah\nWe'll breathe thank you I'm I'm a I don't mean to cut you off there but thank you for your call because I just want to turn it to drew ... now a individual level efforts a professor shouldn't do is breeze asking could they make a difference\nThey can and and again I'd like to highlight that there's some really positive news in this report too so we did not for example\nInvestigate the entire world going to vegetarianism that seems just from so wildly improbable but it's not really worth looking at what we looked at whereas people in primarily in the west who eat too much red meat according to the world Health Organization healthy dietary guidelines just going\nTo do what they should do anyway for their own body and that's enough to make a big difference livestock has an enormous footprint with the land that deforestation that land to feed grow crops to feed the cattle et cetera and so I think there there are things we can do more active\nTransport but biking and walking more use of mass transit those are active transport is also good for your health you know but there but there are limits to we cannot all go buy electric cars unless there is charging infrastructure\nAnd currently at least in the state where I live we have a special tax on electric cars rather than the government trying to encourage us to adopt them so I ... that there are ways that we can facilitate people making choices we can buy more efficient air conditioners\nOnly if they're available in the stores and they're not available and less companies are pushed to make these kind of products so it's an interplay between individual choice and the system that that determines the range of options that are available to Kevin\nWho's calling from ... Louisiana Kevin you're on the air\nHello Hi Kevin what\nDoes that how you doing I just had a comment to make 'em you know I work in a in an oil industry\nAnd um there's a lot of infrastructure that's already in place like in the Gulf of Mexico per se there's\nTwo thousand platforms out there that has jazz jackets and the water might be a little less than that but at least a thousand where wind farms could be adapted to those jackets easily\nI mean but they naturally infrastructure would have to be built to you know the power generation to give it to the beach but that that's something that that could be done also went on when an oil company those exploration on a certain area\nThey have to mitigate somewhere else it doesn't matter they dropped a drop off oil there I'm not if they have to clean the whole time they have to spend money\nTo mitigate another area that needs to mitigate needs restoration mhm so it's it's a balance you know and they do spend money or in to the good I guess some people call it through the good of\nYou know mining industry stumped people it's bad yeah but we use that we need it you know I just that's my comment\nBill ... Kevin thank you actually so much for your call Chris many do you want to respond to and I think that first pies Kevin indicating that I mean he's out there working in the Gulf Oil fields saying that there is an infrastructure in place if we wanted to to expand a wind generation\nWell there's actually a close relationship between offshore oil and offshore wind I mean you you you find\nTo the uh offshore wind industry and that sort of the deep\nOffshore wind industry which is where you need really really powerful infrastructure in where some of the most powerful when can be harnessed and if you can get it to shore then you can get yourself quite a lot of renewable energy I I think I think it goes to show that there is a corporate transition that's happening right now again the it's not at the pace\nThat the one point five see report calls for right but there's all kinds of action happening is just the question is can somehow be be Marshall across the globe um when policies that are unified by all the governments and that's that's really what this report is asking", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "09"}
