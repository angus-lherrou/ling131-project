of click conflicting reports about exactly the scope of the FBI investigation whose putting you know who's writing the limits to that ... what do we know so far\nWell I think the first thing we have to explain to people is that this is not a criminal investigation correct background investigation but that means that the FBI is serving as the conduit if you will and the White House is the client and why aren't White House dictates what they want done and\nFrom what we understand and our reporting they want to focus on the allegations involving Dr Blass you for it\nAnd the allegations regarding a ... so the FBI or we're told yesterday began their interviews of Dr excuse me I'm a mystery here as\nA as she gave them a list of names and again the question is is the FBI allowed to pursue those names that she gave them or don't or do they have to go back to the White House and asked for their permission if you will to go forward\nI see so Michael worried I mean do we know any more about what might happen in those events maybe maybe we do because I'm Still not fully clear on you know the New York times is reporting that are as\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from

Caitlin Huey burns joins us she CBS News digital political reporter pure Thomas is also with us chief justice correspondent for ABC News\nAnd Michael Warren joined us today he's senior writer at the Weekly Standard and of course so much attention focused on the FBI's current background investigation into the allegations are surrounding judge Brett Kavanaugh a and we've got lots of comments here on our website on point radio dot org\nJohn in Amherst says lying and allegations of side if someone with Kavanaugh has demonstrated belligerent and biased capable of serving as a judge on any bench let alone the Supreme Court well in fact this weekend Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona was asked about that on sixty minutes this was just yesterday\nA and here's what he described he saw in Brett Kavanaugh temperament during Kavanaugh's testimony last week\nWhen I heard him hurts someone who\nHope I would someone can fire up and unjustly accused\nAnd to see his family behind us Chris and uh it was there was anger\nChris there that Senator Flake referred to as Senator Chris Coons of Delaware who was also interviewed by sixty minutes and a correspondent Scott Kelly asked Hoon er about the the claim or the assertion or the belief that part of Kavanaugh's testimony and his demeanor in front of the Senate Judiciary committee may have crossed the line\nA lot at all surprised to hear that from other colleagues in the committee or on television but I was really struck that I thought his anger got the best of him and he made a partisan argument that would've been best left to be made for his advocates and defenders on a ready made you wonder about is going\nIn my case yes it made me wonder about his ability to sort of outside\nThat's democratic Senator Chris Coons speaking on sixty minutes there and I keep making the same mistake I keep seeing Mike Judge but I mean to say mark judge and I apologize for it to everyone for that mistake here a ... burns let me just pick up with you because you were speaking to this point before\nThe break here I Wonder um you know all day on Thursday Democrats focused on their call for investigation\nThey got one they got an investigation you know its current term they may not like but I'm Wondering if you think they missed an opportunity here because you know many folks did look at for example that paragraph in judge Kavanaugh was opening statement where he talks about a left wing conspiracy talks about\nThe Clintons 'em\nAnd you know that and perhaps\nSome folks might say they should just simply point at that uh as evidence for of what you know might be judge Kavanaugh sued ability or lack of for the Supreme Court\nI think not paragraph was particularly revealing for a lot of people watching because\nUm remember we're talking about this the as the potential swings Pete on the court from I'm at a conservative at a ideological perspective but when Kavanaugh was talking about the Clintons and the left wing conspiracy I think it did raise questions about whether he would in fact be a partisan\nI'm a political type of person\nAnd so I wouldn't be surprised if the conversation starts to evolve this week away from the\nEvents in question in the Nineteen eighties and more towards Kavanaugh's ability for the court or the question though and that the point that I Would make is that you know a lot of lawmakers made their decisions about ... even before these allegations surfaced you know many deaths\nCould not support him and you had lots of Republicans a friendly cheering him on so there is a question as you know how much the advance as at that we learned last week how much we learn next week how much it will actually change minds I think Republicans also are considering\nThat the idea that they have wanted to shape the makeup of the courts that's been an organizing principle for them and election after election\nAnd so they have to kind of weigh that against the allegations that they've already heard and against any new information that comes out this week that pertains to the events in question and also that pertain to cabin eyes a personality and his fitness for the poor and\nWell Michael wine chime in here because if as Kaitlin says we do start hearing more Democrats talking about issues of temperament will that argument hold any weight now because there has been so much emphasis placed on allowing the FBI to investigate\nA magnet I think if that's where the argument shifts this as Kaitlin suggest it might\nUm it suggests that Brett Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed as a Supreme Court or to the Supreme Court I mean this is I'm a respectfully I think a a a ... that his uh his testimony his anger\nIn that in that testimony on Thursday or somehow revealed something about the kind of justice he would be\nWhat we're not hearing is any sort of analysis of uh his actual time on the bench she's a he said on the DC circuit court one of the most powerful or courts in the country\nOr in this claim about his partisanship has never been made a perhaps it perhaps somebody will now perhaps somebody will go back through some of his decisions and find it but so far they haven't I'm a ... and I think Jeff Flake is getting at something here remember flick is one of the three Republican senators I'm we're on the fence about cabinet none of the Democrats\nAre who are or including Chris Coons were mentioning they're concerned about his temperament of what really ever going to vote for him in the first place um will Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake a change their mind because of the uh the angry way in which cabinet responded to what he claims are smears\nUm I don't think so if if the if the investigation finds out that Kavanaugh has lied about this or has lied about anything anything else that he's been accused of that will change things up but but the anger on display or I think uh uh we won't make a difference with the people\n... and uh\nI really don't have too much\nFaith that he will not be pushed on the screen court so I'm going to be asking [noise] perhaps pretty civics lesson if he is a appointed and confirmed\nUm when will he will he have to decide how many cases she asked to recuse himself because it is a blast it out to carry it or the or Clinton news and there are conspiracy or to the other members of the court to\nDecide when recusal shouldn't and should not be a huge tanker\nRick and Rick thank you for your call peer Thomas you want to pick up on that because\nUh I think if you know a ... judge Kavanaugh on Thursday he talked about well funded left wing groups et cetera and if you're one of those quote unquote left wing groups then you bring a case before the Supreme Court\nWould you be right to be concerned about a ... a justice cabinet if so if he so becomes his ability to fairly duty Katie case like that\n[noise] you know it's interesting a\nLot of the things that were said again we're out of anger I think what the caller is picking up on the invoking the Clinton for example that some people thought that that was\nA a bit too much uh in terms of the judgment whether he recused himself the justices have a lot of latitude to determine what they feel like they they may have a conflict of interest on a but most of the judges and in many of these cases see themselves as fair arbitrators from the facts\nAnd if it's not often that they recused himself from cases\nAll right well let's go to another call here Reggie is calling from law school is the Iowa you're on the air Reggie\nYeah so I was wondering if the FBI comes back and says they can find no evidence to support Dr Ford or any of the other accusers\nThere was a single Democrat going to change their vote because I think they made up their mind the day after Justice Kennedy said he was going to require there were voted no on whoever was nominated I don't even think the Democrats in the Senate believe the charges they just think that's a good cover because they want to vote no ...\nReggie thank you for your call came in he we burns I mean I feel like Joe Manchin is the one one Democrat that keeps coming up\nRight I think that we have to kind of separate separate out some of these red state Democrats either either of course Democrats who are running for reelection this year for the Senate in states that Trump won overwhelmingly so just given that dynamic they often\n\nSupport for on point comes from exact science is offering colder guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening

political reporter also with peer Thomas chief justice correspondent for ABC News and Michael war and senior writer at the Weekly Standard and we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for it to three talk\nOr and I want to talk with all of you about the midterms here in just a just a second here but peer you said something before the break I wanted to follow up on 'em and particularly because you're justice correspondent for ABC News about\nHow the the purpose and intent of the FBI's background ongoing a background investigation right now are into the allegations around judge Kavanaugh that that's supposed to provide some of the detail and clarity\nA around these allegations that until now we possibly don't have a right but I mean I just want your thoughts on this like so many people over the weekend and even today are saying how can we possibly get trustworthy clarity\nIs the FBI isn't even investigating things like the allegations of a judge Kavanaugh's excessive drinking in college we have multiple people coming forward saying\nThey want they want to talk to the to the to the federal agents about this um but perhaps no one's reaching out to them to hear them\n[noise] but I I guess we have to be very careful about describing what the investigation on phones for example a mushroom arrows to talk about the fact of the incident happening at Yale University so the FBI interviews heard and\nThey get information from her regarding other people who may have known about\nEthnic contemporaneously so therefore if the FBI goes in talks with those people they may end up getting information that speaks to whether judge Kavanaugh\nA drink to excess weather here's a demeanor change so that may end up in what's called the FBI three oh two which is in the report that they fall regarding what the witnesses type again the FBI will draw no conclusions about\nWho's telling the truth or not but what you may end up as a body of work which includes witness after witnessing the same kinds of things and again we'll that support judge Kavanaugh's version of a story or whether it's you know attack\nThem well and I mean ... I'm asking you about this and we talked about earlier show because I Want to be sure we get it right a ... we can't be sure if the FBI would talk to those people right because it again there's confusion about whether or not the White House counsel's office saying here's the list of people you can talk to full stop\nRight we don't know if they have to go back to the White House\nThe authority to go do that uh because most times the client wants to know this level of detail most and again the question here and we're we're tiptoeing around it is is there a conflict of interest in this case the White House's client their directing the FBI to pursue the questions that they want answered\nBut at the same time this White House has made it very clear that they want Mr Kavanaugh approved confirmed\nAnd there's no guarantee that we will ever know who the FBI actually spoke to with certainty if the report is not made public and if I'm remembering correctly for example the FBI's investigation back in Ninety One with Clarence Thomas that hasn't been made public at All right\nWell it's in theory we'll go to the White House and then the senators are one hundred or who will vote on his a nomination will be able to get access to it the question then becomes will leak when it gets to Capitol Hill a little bit different era now\n[laughter] so so much has\nSo much and yet so little at the same time and change in Nineteen Ninety One so let's talk a little bit about the more and more detail about the mid term here and in order to set that up I just want to play a actually a clip from a conversation on sixty minutes yesterday with one man who was not running for reelection Republican Senator Jeff flake because\nHe told Scott Kelly or that if you had been running for reelection his decisions regarding um a delaying the vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination would have been very very different\nCould you have done this\nIf you were running no no not yet not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to argue that there is no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nMichael Ward I'm seeing here also is just a recent study from Pew that says that uh Seventy six percent of potential mid term voters are saying that the Supreme Court nominee or the process around it is a very important issue to them in these midterm elections I mean how big is this\nA it is big but I don't think we know exactly how it plays out um you know George Will often says\nThat the political parties organizer animosity is not you know politics has as much about ah who do you hate or maybe a little nicer who do you not like who do not want to see in power\nI'm clearly Donald Trump himself has been an organizing for ... for Democrats who who are sort of woken up uh in our own\nPotential democratic voters are left to be woken up an an energized to vote in the midterms\nI think there is a question about whether or not enough Republicans a have a have been energized I don't think the Trump Administration as it's gone on a had given him Republicans much to be excited about perhaps a and we'll have to wait to see a polling is a week or so after the uh the hearings last week\n... perhaps the feeling that judge Kavanaugh is under siege many uh give Republicans a reason to get to the polls that they haven't had a for the last uh Eighteen months um I don't know if that's going to be the case we've been talking about the way that uh that women voters might respond\nI'm a you know anecdotally I hear from Republican women voters who are sort of take the opposite\nOf you that you might expect and say that I'm actually judge Kavanaugh's treatment um ah as make them more willing to go out and vote for Republicans we just don't know how that's going to play out but I think an issue like this\nIs something that does animate voters or in a way that uh that that that does energized from to get out of the ... ah in November ...\nIn fact we heard the president himself over the weekend that those rallies galvanizing on his orders and saying you know if you want to preserve the\nUh the futures of judges judge Brett Kavanaugh go to the polls in November I mean he's absolutely using it as a rallying cry on the other hand you look on the we've got so many comments on our website in the yard saying\nThat's a quote I think we're seeing a new political party emerge a party of women to different possibilities for the Kevin a nomination the women at the Senate block it or he is confirmed\nAnd the women of the nation rally their power to throw the bums out that is a comment on our website on point radio dot org let's go to Steve who's calling from Bangor Maine you're on the air Steve\nI Would agree with that post that is absolutely I find that in my own ... you know all of this will go um it's a generational thing where at least social media is lit up and I think\nThere are females are are motivated now they've listened to their mothers or the grandmother say you know uh uh the slogans like we really haven't come a long way baby and we have it this is like\nWhere we haven't changed we still have men mostly now in their fifties who are making decisions you know on a health care pay you know talk about sexual assault in the U.S military unknown and men still haven't done nothing\nHere's meals are motivated organizing a Alexander ... New York for the that's another one called ... you know you really have a woman can really you know get out of the kitchen\nWill seem you know since you brought up to us the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez a victory there I I Want to actually take that and thank you so much for your call and turn it to Caitlyn Huey burns because you know we heard Michael say earlier a just a minute to Michael warned saying\nThat um you know he asks and I think it's a good question uh you know how many democratic voters are they're left to be woken up for these midterms um uh but as the caller pointed out there's the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez a race in New York\n... victory in Massachusetts as well I mean to those both those campaign so they want because they brought voters to the people who pulled who had never voted before so\nYou could the Kavanaugh stuff further galvanize those young people\nWell I think that Michael brings up a really key point and something that question that I've been hearing from Republicans as what is this feeling of enthusiasm for Democrats we know that it is there we've seen it and the turnout numbers from the primaries we've also seen in terms of women", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "01"}
