U. T. we've got links to her latest stories on the Texas Senate race at one point radio dot org actually Lopez will come to the program\nHey magna so first of all like well why do some of the basics here for people who aren't as familiar with the Texas Senate races obsessive politics watchers might be I mean how close is the race right now between a Senator Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke\nIf you ask some experts they say it's a toss up pretty much um\nHave got the two candidates closer which is surprising a lot of people because as you mentioned this is not a swing state so a Sweeney election especially for mid term is is ... this is really surprising in Texas\nSo a toss up and has it been like that consistently for the past couple of months or is it the narrowing or or widening\nWell in the beginning it seemed like this was you know ... not going to be a ... a race at all I mean when that over at first and now to the Congress and about I mean I'll pass so when he first announced everyone's like you know this is a really interesting candidate a lot of people like him he's you know really interested in working\nWith you know a Republican in Congress he isn't well known for being friends with will hurt who is a Republican in Congress so that was kind of thing it was\nReally a bipartisan friendly guy um but you know they didn't think that a ton of money would flood flood into Texas where this race so you know it was going to seem like a long shot for better work but um it's only in the past couple of months that it seems like this race is getting closer than anyone expected okay and\nSo then what's ... what's the cause of the traction it seems that Beto O'Rourke a is is is gaining here in Texas\nI mean it's a couple of things I mean the blue wave that everyone's talking about I mean it really is is their democratic voters all across the country that are more interested in voting in mid term than probably ever I mean that we'll see we'll we'll see what that looks like on election day but\nSupport for on point comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening tests that can be used at home by prescription only information that Colo guard tests dot com and Geico\nOffering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks are SUVs and providing twenty four seven customer service more information on auto insurance Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about the race for Senate in Texas and that's the race between incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz\nAnd congressman Beto O'Rourke it's a close race which is surprising a lot of people and it's why it's one of the reasons why it's maybe one of the most watched Senate races in the country right now ahead of the midterms\nAnd we're joined today by Ashley Lopez she's a senior reporter for K. U. T. she's joining us from Austin, Texas\nBrandon running house joins us as well he's a political science professor at the University of Houston joining us from Houston as well and we want to know what you think I mean if you're if you're living in Texas what is this Senate race feel I feel like to you on the ground here what do you think about the fact that it's so close between\nCrews and or ... and if you're living outside of Texas\nOh what is the the Texas race mean to you in terms of what we might see politically when the midterms do roll around in November we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nAshley Lopez I wanted to turn back to you here for a second because we were talking about the the really big growth and the Latino community intact\nHispanic or Latino and I'm seeing some numbers here two and a half million maybe to point seven million new Texans have come into the state between uh since two thousand ten and more than half of them are Latino so this is a ... a huge potential I don't want to call it a voting bloc that are not monolithic\nAs brand and was saying but the huge growth in I'm In the electorate there\nYeah and Latino they're set to become at least by twenty twenty two the biggest population group and the state so even if Democrats where to find a way to mobilize and and get loyalty among a large portion of that group\nAnd they would argue I've I've heard that immigration because it's such a huge issue and the Trump Administration has had such unpopular policies here in Texas among Latinos that this would be like the right time to start doing that\nI mean the other issue and and I heard this a lot from people who work in democratic politics who said that you know they see this opening to really um capture a larger part of the Latino group\nA Latino voters is that they haven't really spent a lot of money here it takes a lot of money to register voters in Texas and voter registration drives and mobilization therefore it costs a lot of money and Texas\nAnd progressive groups in third party groups that are interested in growing the Democratic party don't see a good investment here because it's been so Republican for so long so I mean it is true that this is this could be the future of the party it probably is the future of the party\nI'm here in Texas but it it just you know it takes a lot more work\nThan has yet Ian I see a\nBrand and running house so we can focus a whole hour multiple hours on the the political force that the growing Hispanic and Latino community in Texas\nOr will form but I'm also seeing though that you're taking the conversation back to how Texans feel about president Donald Trump that in fact the president's ah um approval ratings in Texas are probably lower than the one might think some thirty nine percent\nThey're they're low overall um recent polling has gotten more and about fifty percent um but that's really propped up by Republicans who support him to the tune of about eighty six\nTo Ninety percent so it's really driven by Republicans and this is not terribly surprising if there's a lot of unity within the party that number has grown because there was a time where there are definitely\nPeople who objected to Donald Trump and Democrats or Republicans who were favoring\nTed Cruz and so now it's kind of morphed into one bigger sort of\nMore continuous unit for Republicans that support on\nFlinch when this race I mean ... white suburban white women or women in general\nYeah I think that the suburban white women are going to be the biggest swing vote in this election that's really gonna what's probably drive any kind of success that will work fines and suburbs which is going to have a reciprocal effect of affecting some of the challengers the congressional level many of whom have\nA really harness this vote and could potentially do well but I also think if we're talking about changing demographics that we could talk about younger voters who are energized in significant ways in this election so that number breaks ... considerably in favor of better or work they don't treat typically vote in the same numbers that we see for\nPeople who are over forty but it is the case that those numbers are rising and just as an aside to I think that the number of Asian voters is increasing in some of the big suburbs in\nThese big Texas counties you've got the number of Asians far outpacing the actual growth of any other sub racial group and as a result you've got them potentially being of our luck poor partner\nPlaces like forbidden county you're outside of Harris County outside of Houston are booming and that really could spell another level of success that Democrats might find so\nAshley Lopez that makes it seem as if turnout is going to be absolutely everything in the in this race in November\nWell it's always the wild card in elections in Texas I'm a big reason you know Democrats are always say a bakery then that Texas has read is not because it's a conservative state it because it's a non voting day\nIf you get all these populations who don't usually vote that could change what text it looks like if you change the electorate you can change your gets elected so that's always the big question and especially during the mid term\nI mean this is a weird mid term because you know everyone's kind of excited and and angry and you know all that they typically like Democrats aren't likely to vote during mid term so if if that is different this year like this could look different than most mid term yeah so I'm\nSeeing for example ... I'm\nA a couple of Saturdays ago is quoted as having that our contention is that if no one's ever shown up\nAnd listen to you talking to to to voters or potential voters and incorporated your story into why they're campaigning and the expectations were setting for one another then I wouldn't expect you to vote either so is he hoping\nTo draw out people who haven't bothered or haven't seen a reason to vote before I mean that's the that's the tactics that we've seen in other places we saw that\nIn New York with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez for example\nIt's like what he's betting on yeah go ahead\nTalking about probably on the order of about forty percent which is extremely low now I think we'll have a turnout probably like a little bit in this election because you definitely have the energy that we've seen 'em\nAnd so that's something that would definitely I think produced some democratic gains but you still have about two and a half million on register Texans who could otherwise register\nThe Latino population is only registered to vote at about thirty forty four percent and that number is about eighty percent for Anglo so there are still some fundamental voting demographics that make it really difficult for Democrats to win statewide\nOkay well I Want to listen to a little bit more from the candidates themselves and by the way I should know that we definitely reached out to Senator Ted Cruz his campaign and to come to some better roads campaign as well\nInvited them or or one of the represent their representatives to join us today uh aerobics campaign declined our request and senator Cruz's campaign never responded to our class but we do our due diligence on that part\nBut let's hear from the senator anyway this is from the uh the Senate debate that they had on September twenty second and Senator Ted Cruz was asked about his contentious relationship with President Donald Trump especially the relationship they had during the twenty sixteen election and here's what Senator Ted Cruz said\nI have worked hand in hand with the president\nOn substance and we have delivered remarkable victories the biggest tax kind of a generation we've seen for a million new jobs created since Trump was elected and we and we cut taxes and cut regulations we're seeing record low unemployment Texans lives are better so yes I could have chosen\nTo make it about myself to be selfish and say you know what my feelings are hurt so I'm going to take my marbles and go home but I think that would have been not doing the job I was elected to\nThat Senator Ted Cruz on September twenty second let's take a call here Dan is calling from San Antonio you're on the air Dan\nHi thanks for taking my call 'em I wanted to say that\nThere's a lot of water and I don't have all that much time but I did want to say that that will work gives me and my family's in ... that we haven't felt love generation um my parents would say like John F. Kennedy or the Kennedy family inspiring us to to have some hope\nBecause living in this so called red state makes us cringe every time I hear that because we were staunch blue family and everyone I Know just about is or at least inside\nTheir county here in San Antonio or however we are very diverse state and it's all good and I like the message that this war is about hope and moving forward\nComes from Mr Trump and do you see and that's not what we're hearing soon telling you in Texas and probably most of American people are just ...\n\n\nSupport for on point comes from ...

body we're talking about the Senate race in Texas between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke and I'm joined today by Ashley Lopez brand and riding house and Abby Livingston\nAs well and look here are some of the ads that Texans are are listening and listening to end and watching on their television\nThis is from a campaign ad from Beto O'Rourke it's one of his highlights one of his favorite talking points that he's visited every county in Texas to meet people across the state and he highlighted that fact in his first ad\nOnly where you're from shore in every community in every county [noise]\nYou know the office then George Washington actually Brian structures margins\nThat's an ad from congressman Beto O'Rourke campaign and here's some sound from an ad that Senator Ted Cruz's campaign is running\nOne\nNot a chance to\nLive in\nAn ad there from Senator Ted Cruz Brennan running house that that Ted Cruz add ... ... talk to me a little bit about it because I think it speaks to something that that a lot of Texans hold dear I mean the the right to gun ownership but the idea that\nUm uh that you maybe liberalism can't be something that that represents the state of Texas\nYeah I thought you're going to say that this was something that holds the tech hold dear because it's like country music but I think that's true of well there's definitely a synergy there and clearly the cruise campaign understands how to run in taxes they know that there's a certain like guys as you say for\nVoting um to keep you know people's gardens I'm keeping a fairly conservative philosophy and that's something that was successful for Ted Cruz so there's definitely enough Republican support\nIn a midterm election that an organic\nKind of campaign that relies on priming Republicans through these conservative policies can work or work pastor tangibly make up about a million votes and that just assure as God made little green apples Republicans will come to vote in mid term so\nThe difficulty of trying to make up to that with a campaign like Cruz's running which primes Republicans and primes conservatives it just makes\nHi good morning I'm just calling and I made millennial voters and for the twenty sixteen election I had voted for Donald Trump\nAnd um I grew up in a conservative household my husband is conservative my whole family is but I've been very encouraged and I and voting for ... this election in November just because people can be on party lines and I think that's so important\nTo 'em in the day and age are at like you're either a Republican or Democrat\nI Am a mother and I have two children and I think it's so important that I raised my children with positive values and I really appreciate what that does work is going out there and I'm making it a point to meet people where they're at ... and um I really appreciate what he's doing\nBecause he touched a few quick question before before you go yeah did you support Senator Cruz before this year yes I did oh so what's changed their hand\nIn that um I really I whenever he was in the twenty sixth election\nOn how just doesn't like the talk that whenever he was talking to 'em President Trump and just how\nLike how he's steady getting sand and all of a sudden he decided oh I'm gonna be for him and then I don't know like President Trump tweets about Ted Cruz and and now he's supporting him I just think that\nYou're a true um I think it's important that person's true colors and how he just was really again President Trump and all of a sudden he's for him like that to show you something about some of these personalities you know I really appreciate how that will work is just um he is who he is\nOf course there is that if you can I ask you one more question I'm again I'm really glad you called in because you were talking about you you liked the fact that you you think food do you feel better roads supports women's rights I mean I just want to touch on one of these controversies that hit the ... campaign recently right to\nA controversy over something he wrote in Nineteen Ninety One or a review for a Broadway musical of where he in the review he wrote some I'm an unkind things about the female actresses in the Broadway musical you know he wrote that there are only qualification seemed to be their phenomenally large\nBody parts and you say it does that concern you\n[noise] um I I don't know um [noise]\nI Know he's apologized for it mhm and um [noise] I I honestly I don't know I Know that I mean I Can't say that okay because that's not that it takes a lot for them\nThose are perfectly finance or rock hard certainty sometimes is probably is what gets us in trouble so who thank you so much for your call Abby Livingston let me turn back to you on that Christine on the one hand must be a Republican Texas Republicans worst nightmare but on the other hand I mean she talked the we talked about Senator Ted Cruz I keep coming back to this question about whether the challenger\nThis time around is Ted Cruz himself and that we wouldn't be having this conversation if there were more\nPositive and likeable Republican senatorial candidate\nI think it's also I think she I I've heard similar things I from what she said um I think it's important to remember what a rough landing crews had in his presidential campaign and he was sort of\nYou know I mean it it's hard to um be against Trump I mean in retrospect endorsing Trump and the fall of twenty sixteen was probably smart political news um but it did there there are women in Texas who have a lot of problems particularly when Trump made fun of cruises wife\nI'm In ... in taxes that's just sort of a an at I Would call these women had been should stand up for his wife\nAnd so it's it's a ... he would than I Do think if this was John Cornyn we wouldn't be talking about this race or it would be much more um he would have a much bigger lead a corner and it's just a different presidents and Cruz is very very polarizing and so I think she underscores that\nOkay well I Want to play one more piece of tape here uh this is something that went viral on social media and um it has to do with an answer that Beto O'Rourke gave\n'em when he took a question from an audience member at a campaign event and the question of believe came up from a military veteran and the veteran asked whether or not\nNFL players taking a knee during the national anthem was disrespectful to members of the military and over again to ended up giving quite a long answer was several minutes long um he began by saying my short answer is no I don't think it's disrespectful\nUm and so we just want to play a portion of the remainder of what he said\nAre frustrated frankly with people like me and knowing the vicious public trials and power who have been unable to resolve it brings justice for what has been going ... to happen in this country and I don't know why when we peacefully\nWhile the country are watching these games they take on me to bring attention to this problem to ensure that we strictly about why they're doing it and I can think of nothing more\n[noise] [noise]\nActually Lopez or other mentioned that went viral on social media which may or may not have significant meaning but how did that go over in Texas\nWell I mean if you look at the black vote in Texas I Would say it went over really well specifically among black voters he had something like Ninety seven percent approval according to like one latest pulling that one might be a little high but it it's not unlike most polls that have come out\nUm you know conservatives this is red meat for them this is something that Ted Cruz had been talking about um the NFL or then that the protest during the national anthem he's been talking about his rallies\nBecause it really frustrates conservative or they see this has like disrespectful to the flag into veteran so you know if you look at like democratic base voters this is something that they are so excited to hear you know a Democrat\nI'm standing up for racial injustice in their eyes and then on the on the other side you know conservative voters you know this is a polarizing issue so conservative voters see this very differently and are very frustrated by this yeah\nBrenda running health I mean I think ... outside of Texas political watchers are saying\nThat perhaps this is the way ... talks about these issues uh is one of the reasons why he's getting so much traction there that it's not\nSort of evasive around the central issues of ... that you know the NFL players themselves ... or wanting to bring to to the national consciousness and that it's surprising to actually hero or a politician engage with the ideas and that way", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)",
