CBS News correspondent covering the Justice Department the White House and legal affairs\nAnd also in Washington is he'll could poor he's national political reporter for Bloomberg Politics\nAnd everyone you can imagine there's a lot of people who already wanna uh tell us what they think and and what they have to say about the Kavanaugh confirmations so I'm just going to get a couple of calls in here let's go to William who's calling from Berkeley Michigan you're on the hour William\nHow are you I'm doing well how are you\nGood thank you um\nYeah you know the whole process was just are being an independent swinging mostly the Democrat lost my wife and I and I thought it\nWas just so much negativity and what feels like a [noise] it's just constant constant negative energy that I'm I'm I'm all in the right level to leave or this time\nYou're going to vote Republican in the midterms\nYes yeah and I and and I and I see going on with you\nIt's really amazing how um how just all the things that you're back and forth to just to just to back it\nAll right William thank you so much for your call let's go to Kathleen who's calling from Dayton, Ohio Kathleen you're on the air\nHi good morning things that I mean sorry [laughter] thanks for taking my call ah anyway I I I was shocked that center caused quite frankly because you know she clearly she voted lake and ah\nI'm Sorry a an arrogant privilege sexist old white Republican man and how Republicans couldn't be concerned about Kavanaugh prior to the sexual assault\nUp you know claims you know based on ... you know the questions lay he asked him about lying under oath and and and receiving a stolen emails and and then we have all these uh a\nLaw professor was across the country coming out against him and and the former justice but here's how I spent my weekend which I'd already been doing I went down into the some of the poorest neighborhoods in Dayton, Ohio on quitting and street on little street\nOld industrial ah parts of Dayton where I Am familiar with these neighborhoods for fifty years ago and now these areas you know where it was white\nYou know mostly white a middle class or being able to work in the manufacturing plant the downtown dating and now it's very poor Hispanic black\nWhites and the majority of the homes are either in shambles or boarded off so\nSo we can't find them or I I'm Sorry to jump in here but but are you telling me that like your your out trying to turn it turned out the vote for the midterms\nYou got it and you got it and I was doing it prior to what courage ever been I don't care whether Republican a damning independent get out and get into the\nNeighborhoods neighborhoods where people are really suffering and and you know come on and Republicans in Dems need to get down into these neighborhoods and see what's going on for these people who can't access\nJobs who who are living in ... homes which in shambles\nWho prior Kathleen I'm gonna I'm so sorry to interrupt them and take it back from you there because I Want to turn what you're saying to to our guest here\nA polar read your hearing a lot of energy there just from you know two of our callers one of them saying he's gonna he's going to vote Republican almost entirely across his ballot for the first time in his life and then you heard Kathleen there in Ohio things she's going to try and turn on democratic votes so I mean how much\nCan we tell how much has this fight over just as Kevin are really further energized I'm a voter's going into the midterm would is certainly energized voters go into the midterms to question\nKavanaugh confirmation process did not go how the White House had hoped but the one outside for them is that it was mobilizing voters ahead of this critical midterm election the poll showed that it was helping them sort of closes enthusiasm gap there are having trouble closing on their own modality has been confirmed now that they sort of solidified have solidified\nOthers conservative majority on the Supreme Court the question is whether or not they'll be able to continue this momentum she heard the president and Kansas over the weekend I can hear him say this again him and his allies trying to sort of famous as it's all Democrats trying to obstruct their agenda with vendors for the Trump\nOn that the Trump victory in a presidential campaign to try to continue to get people are angry enough to get up and vote in November and there's no question that that folks on the other side democratic and progressive that they are certainly mobilized and this has been a catalyst\nFor many of them to do our cart others to vote but again the big challenge for the president is allies and can you sustain this yeah they're not\nNow Dick Pullman a here in Pennsylvania we've got a brand new district maps congressional district map and so we have a lot of races that are newly competitive that weren't a thrown out in the last cycle here so how much might major issues like a you know the confirmation battle over justice Kavanaugh\nAffect what's gonna happen ...\nWell I think you know the cabinet things really in some ways for a lot of these new districts which are a lot more democratic friendly than the old when this when the new districts were by court ah\nAnd um they're much more sort of a ... they have a much more of a sort of appropriate mix of democratic independent and Republican voters in the old district um and the but the Kavanaugh\nThing the kennel things really I think are just sort of be a cap or on a lot of the energy that\nHas driven a lot of suburban white women suburban white educated women\nAre toward the Democrats uh we'd be talking about a blue wave for months uh I don't necessarily think that just because there's reports now increased Republican enthusiasm here and elsewhere that that blue wave narrative should go away because I think what's gonna happen is it all depends how to ... to see that something\nIs going to land disproportionally in different planes so a lot of these house districts where which are strong suburban districts like a lot of the ones in and around Philadelphia a are\nUm are being energized by by women who are really fed up with Trump over a lot of Republicans over a lot of things Kevin are being nearly the latest so you know it's hard for me to imagine that the Republicans excuse me\nIn Pennsylvania alone there's twenty three twenty four districts nationwide that are that Republicans have that Hillary Clinton won the presidential vote\nIn in twenty sixteen those are very vulnerable so I think this whole thing about enthusiasm is going to it's going to fall different different places the red state Senate the red state Senate seats that Democrats have no that's where I can see a lot more\nRepublican enthusiasm may be making a difference from some of the\nNorth Dakota and Heidi Heitkamp back right she\nShe might she might be tossed McConnell Mitch McConnell may be right when he says this is going to energize Republicans to keep the Senate the house I'm not sure well\nHe'll crippled I'm going to come to you here in a second but a ... mentioned the Senate and we had that caller Kathleen from Ohio expressing her distaste for Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her vote to confirm justice Kevin ... we have a U.S some tape here from Senator Collins she spoke with Scott Kelly on CBS is sixty minutes last night\nAnd said she felt very comfortable with her says her decision to support cabinet despite the testimony given by professor Christine Blasey Ford\nWas clearly terrified traumatized and I believed that of sexual assault had\nTo her why I think she's mistaken about is who was the perpetrator flats I Do not believe hers Fallon with Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd then he'll ... senator calling also spoke extensively on the floor of the Senate explaining why she was going to catch that affirmative vote for Kavanaugh\nAnd then we have this strange happening on Twitter where Susan Rice apparently hints that she might do proto into a race against Susan Collins wouldn't hold up for re election in a couple of years I mean what's going on their\nVote Susan Collins was obviously one of the pedal swing votes it's arguable that if she voted the other way than Joe Manchin the Democratic came out almost within moments of her announcing her vote\nI Would have gone the other way and the cabinet nomination would have would have sunk\nNow progressive activists have already worked on a campaign to raise a lot of money for whichever Democrat challenges Susan Collins and twenty twenty she is a sole surviving blue state Republican in the Senate so that makes her quite a target I think our reasons for\nVoting for cap and I was that number one she said ideologically he's acceptable and that the president should have ... you know wide latitude to pick 'em adjusted as long as they're qualified\n\n[noise] support for on

it\nCBS News correspondent covering the Justice Department the White House and legal affairs\nAnd so he'll ... poor joins us as well as national political reporter for Bloomberg Politics and the hill I wanted to turn something to you here because we heard Paula uh especially talk about before the break that the president wants to talk about things like NAFTA or when he's out there on on rallies but perhaps the news about justice Kavanaugh has kind of around a lot of that out\nI mean there were some other big issues as well that lots of folks were campaigning on him I guess primarily health care it has that whole sort of been temporarily satisfied or do you think that they will will come back to voters and and candidates are going to come back to focus on these person this didn't\nIssues or the ... the the country still grappling with\nYes healthcare certainly has not subsided that whatever happens in Washington and you know what whatever kind of a a heated Supreme Court confirmation battle it's happening healthcare has remained\nIn more cold than not that I've seen the number one issue for voters throughout this election it's deeply personal to them and I think the uh the efforts to the repeal and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act inflamed that debate\nA and and kind of a unique way that we haven't seen but the bottom line here is that the mid term elections usually come down to a set of basic fundamentals in that as\nPresidential approval rating and the generic congressional ballot and the last we've seen the president's approval is\nSomewhere hovering around forty percent or it's historically not good and usually the uh the president's party suffers big losses especially when they're ... at that level and the generic ballot we've seen it fluctuate a little bit but Democrats have in more and more polls and not enough of an advantage to take the house now for the president campaigning\nHis efforts on the campaign trail are likely to hurt Republicans in the house and help Republicans and the Senate he is very he's in a very good position to help the Senate Republican candidate or trying to defeat a red state Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia Jon Tester in Montana\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota who is probably the most endangered Donald Rumsfeld it breaks down differently in different places that Republicans have kind of a dream of a Senate map where\nYou know twelve out of the Thirteen most competitive races are in states that President Trump won in about half of them by massive margins\nWell I mean as you mentioned and Dick actually mentioned before the break that mid term generally are seen as a referendum on on the sitting president which you know could make it a tough tough tough challenge for Republicans a this coming November but on the other hand because of the acrimony over the cabinet a confirmation\nAnd joining leader Mitch McConnell on CBS TV's face the nation just yesterday staying at democratic protest over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation had actually reinvigorated Republican voter\nIronically the behavior of the first to Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee and then\nThe overreach of the protesters at the Capitol is actually energize the Republican base up particularly in a red states where we're trying to pick up seats out across America so I Want to thank I Want to thank the other side for the tactics that have allowed us to kind of energize and get involved I own a voters\nDick Pullman do you think that's enough to sort of overwhelmed the negative ratings are the low approval ratings that we have at the\n... well yeah maybe on the Senate side like we've been talking about but um you know I think\nHe's doing that in part because uh\nI don't know much else they they really have I mean we don't we just talked to a few minutes ago about you know their past tax reform but if you look at how tax reform as polling most Americans don't think it's really making much of a of a bite of not by much of a boost to their income so that really hasn't been playing very well\nOr they did promise to above a abolishing obliterate Obamacare Obamacare is still there and as a matter of fact whereas Democrats used to run away from Obamacare has a campaign issue\nThis year particularly on the house side they're embracing it and it's not just I don't you see it around here in Pennsylvania side but over just across the river here in South New Jersey a there's a long time Republican congressional seat that is a very uh it may tip to the Democrats this time because the Democratic candidate by the name of Andy Kim\nA is every day he's stressing healthcare a\nAnd they don't talk about you know they're not talking to the Democratic candidates aren't really talking that much about Kavanaugh much less about impeaching a Trump or anything like that they're trying to stick with what they think are sort of fundamental kitchen table stuff uh\nThat um you know is going to sort of a you know cancel out any ah\nProtecting potentially temporary spikes in Republican enthusiasm so I think when McConnell is doing is you know he's driving what he hopes happens he figures you know if they said enough and they stuck it up enough you know the hope and the belief becomes reality but I think they have a I got a ways to go on closing that gap\nWill probably read I'm going to go to a couple of callers here but I just wanted to give you a quick shot at best and you know issues like health care a persistent issues and and and Dick's right I mean we were out in uh Pennsylvania New status\nTypically less about Kavanaugh himself all the women\nThe board were very energized\nI think that's right you have it on certainly something that sets trans fats here in the beltway and obviously to the hearings got enormous viewership there would interest but I don't know\nNecessarily how much that oil guy field uphold the then President Trump's election edited come down to issues like health care immigration I'd infrastructure these kinds of things and I'm surprised that Democrats haven't hammered the president a harder on there for the health care act in their promise that need and and not kept yet\nYeah stick Pullman actually there's something you said earlier in the show they want to just circle back to a little bit because yeah we can we can talk about health care we can talk about immigration et cetera but you made the point\nThat you didn't quite understand why Democrats haven't yet made long term changes like that can that can come with things like Supreme Court justice appointments more central to their argument or they're you know the sale that you're trying to do with voters here do you think they should now\nWell I yeah I think they should I think they should have I think they should have a long time ago uh uh\nYou know maybe there's this whole notion maybe a lot of Democrats hold on this notion that ah the courts are\nUh are impartial and independent and people and voters don't like to think of them as being part of the ... battlegrounds\nUm but the Republicans have successfully\nA campaign that way for years I mean you can go back to even the nineties late Nineteen sixties when President Nixon a ... then candidate Nixon in Nineteen sixty eight was talking about\nThe law the warranty Earl Warren court and how the law you know we need more law and order he campaigned against the court in sixty eight successfully and some so for years Democrats have not\nThey have not stress the court uh uh\nI thought that there are ... what happened with the Merrick Garland in twenty sixteen I think if you flip the parties around and and a Republican ... Republican president but an office and had nominated in February of an election year a well qualified Court nominee\nAnd he didn't even get ahead you can get a hearing saying from a democratic candidate I think it would have been stolen seat would have been a hash tag the entire year and I said I don't understand why the Democrats yet so he'll go ahead\nSo yeah I I just wanted to add a it's a great point that they make because it was you know the decisions of the Warren Court from the fifties and and the Berger court through the seventies things like\nMiranda rights for criminal suspects you know brown versus board of education and and the backlash from the south you know to the Supreme Court bang racial segregation roe versus Wade that galvanized the conservative movement and they built a very ...\nA vet Supreme Court candidates were were solidly conservative you know who would vote with them and to advance their goals they did that as a ... you know and and they're able to do that partly as a result of a backlash to these liberal decisions at the Supreme Court made in that time a ... a question I have now is whether the left can catapult\nOr you can do a similar thing now in an era where the Supreme Court has made decisions like Bush Gore um Citizens United which you know the the pro or anti campaign finance regulation ruling\nPaved the way for a lot of dark money in politics to the Supreme Court decision to cut the voting rights act an addict mentioned the\nBlockade of a President Obama Supreme Court vacancy with Merrick Garland by Republican leaders in the Senate\nKent liberal use that to motivate their base to care about the Supreme Court because right now the ... the conservative movement the conservative base has a massive advantage on this issue\nWill get a couple more calls here before we switch gears to let's go to Amanda calling from Charleston South Carolina Amanda you're on the air\nHi I'm ahead go ahead\nYes I Would just I Would just like to say that uh we really we need a blue ... here and not a blue wave\nMitch McConnell orange hatch a Chuck Grassley and I'll go ahead and try when Dianne Feinstein the mostly old white men who are the majority", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "08"}
