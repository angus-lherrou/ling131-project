one eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\n\nHis own point I'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking with former Florida Senator Bob Graham he was the co chair of the joint congressional investigation into the nine eleven attacks he's been watching Saudi Arabia for almost Twenty years now and he's saying that it's time for Washington to really stop coddling\nThe Saudi kingdom where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five the eight hundred for two three talk a Senator Graham I Hope you can forgive me that I had to cut you off there before the break because um you're telling us is very interesting story about a Saudi couple a young Saudi couple in\nSarasota, Florida who you first heard about in in two thousand eleven now if I if I'm reading the reporting around this correctly that they lived in a gated community right and in fact the name of a Mohammed Ali ... the leader of the nine eleven hijackers a\n... and his license plate information was\nAnd that leader on the FBI Tampa office had actually compiled of lengthy report about with connections between the hijackers and his family but with the FBI give you that report\nYou know uh and after attempting to get access to the report we uh\nWe which was to some journalists and myself\nA filed a freedom of Information Act or to get access initially the FBI said they didn't have any information on the three a flight students and the Saudi family\nOr the judge rejected that as being a on believable or they even said that uh they\nUh had a a few documents a and the judge and that was all there was the judge rejected that\nThen a ... without further action the FBI voluntarily uh directed eighty thousand eighty thousand pages of information that was that had been taken a in a post nine eleven\nSurvey of the situation in Sarasota\nOf with the judge then to determine what which of those ... eighty thousand pages could be made public\nA it is now almost a November of two thousand Eighteen or an after six years the judge has yet to rule on what if any of those eighty thousand\nPages are can be made available to the American public okay\nCenter there and I want us to get that back here though because the ... you write to those ... eighty thousand pages are currently in the possession of a Florida federal judge eighty thousand pages about this one family or at least investigations in Sarasota not yet made available to the public in any way shape or form but even before\nOr the judge made that decision to start taking a look at the other pages I mean you had contacted the FBI right to ask for some of the reports at least um and did you you had to even go to the FBI in central record keeping office to even see\nSome of some of these reports and that a ... and the FBI wasn't being cooperative in giving you any information is that right\nShortly after the situation Sarasota was discovered uh my wife and I were\nA in the Washington area to have Thanksgiving with our second daughter third daughter ah and ah we were intercepted at a Logan Airport and taken to the FBI office which is located there\nAre an essentially told by the number two person the deputy director of the FBI or that we're wasting our time and that I should\nUh shut up and go oh you were the ... of\nThe nine eleven commission and the and the number two person that the FBI was telling you you were wasting your time trying to follow the lead about what the FBI investigated regarding possible connections between the Saudi family in the hijackers I mean it it almost ... belief that as\nWell and it gets it gets worse um so I uh\nI said I told the deputy director of the information that I wanted and he said will come to our office and we will talk about this so\nI did uh and uh the when I got there the deputy director told me that to the meeting that we were going to have\nA had been cancelled and they would not be rescheduled a and that again I was wasting my time uh that's the last of\nQuasar official contact that I've had with the FBI on the Sarasota us situation\nCenter [noise] nine eleven [noise]\nYou know we were Seventeen years out and\nAnybody who was alive and remembers that they will never forget it I mean thousands of people were killed and and I'm hearing you tell me that the FBI as late as two thousand eleven was actively trying to dissuade you from\nA you know as the United states senator from trying to find out what federal investigators may have known or uncovered and then I mean you said before with utter conviction\nThat you you you you believe that the United states already have within in possession information it ought to be making it ought to make available to the public about Saudi complicity in this massive act of terrorism why is that not happening who is stopping that from happening well\nWhy has there been this uh uh reticence to release information I think for the Bush administration the reason was that they wanted to put the blame for nine eleven on Iraq and anything that\nAre raised the possibility that another nation state I was responsible ran counter to that narrative or the\nEnigma to me is the Obama administration of President Obama had run in two thousand eight in large part on his opposition to the war in Iraq and\nHad raised questions about the bad Saudi Arabia and why it wasn't more and focus of attention\nBut a ... fight of that and nothing was done in his administration or to expedite the release of information on nine eleven and now\nA President Trump\nHas made a Saudi Arabia one of the darling of U.S foreign policy was the first country that he visited a as a president has been very Folsom in his ah\nStatements of approval of a Saudi Arabia and so we've gone for a three presidents sees a and no uh\nAssertive effort or from the White House or to let the American people a share the information that the government has and form opinions as to responsibility for nine eleven yeah\nAnd I'm going to take a couple of quick call here senator but but just one more thing to reiterate there has been no official report so far that I Know of\nThat even willing to entertain this not um that no one no official reports saying that there's any evidence of Saudi complicity in any of these acts that we've been we've been talking about but I mean when you go so far as to say that you have seen\nAgain in your time is co chair of nine eleven a commissioner that you've seen evidence of documentation or something anything that tied the Saudi royal family itself to something like nine eleven\nI mean I think the twenty eight pages you've already cited the one situation where prince band or who is the ambassador\nPersons who played a critical role in uh nine eleven [noise]\nWell let's go to a caller here Charlie is calling from New Orleans Louisiana Charlie you're on the air\nI thanks for taking my call Megan Senator Graham or like my question is Saudi Arabia is obviously a big major ally in the middle east uh currently I'm a with respect to\nA foreign policy on with Iran there are more conservative factor in Saudi Arabia ... out of the ballot in where are

professionals are keeping an eye on a growing number of cases of acute flash said my light is a condition that the Centers for Disease Control says it's affecting at least one hundred and fifty five patients in twenty two states\nIt's rare but serious and the disease affects the nervous system and its causes aren't entirely no\nWell you can join us because we're speaking with it will be speaking in a moment a doctor or who's been treating patients with acute class at my lettuce and we want to know what your questions are about this disease have you seen it sticking children in your community where one eight hundred for two three eighty five five it's eight hundred for two three talk\nYou can also join us anytime it on the radio dot org or Twitter and Facebook\nAt on point radio and joining us now from Dallas texas is Dr Benjamin Greenberg he's a professor in the department of neurology and euro therapeutics at the University of Texas Southwestern medical center is also an expert in treating rare autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system and he's already treated eight patients with acute\nBlasted mile a mile latest this year Dr Greenberg welcome to implant thank you might not happy to be here\nSo first of all just give us the uh the the the non sensational facts about this disease I'm this is a virus that it's not unknown to science we've seen it before\nYou're correct and the the facts are also we are part of the issue relative to some confusion so when we talk about acute ... it is a clinical diagnosis it refers to a certain set of symptoms in a certain type of damage\nThat can occur in the spinal cord usually in children but it can affect adults are there are multiple ways to damage this part of his bottle\nSummer early fall the United states has seen a spike in number of children who have become paralyzed with\nThis feeling that type of a condition of ... and the suspicion has been that during the seasons every other year there has been a circulating virus or viruses that has been responsible for the majority of those cases\nOkay and that that's an intro virus\nIt is that's the suspicion or the enter a viruses are a group of viruses that are very common uh usually cause either respiratory or gastrointestinal a illnesses that are usually quite mild\nUh most people don't even know it when they've been infected with an enter a virus and if it does cause symptoms it's it's a common cold and then in very rare situations certain enter a viruses have been associated with damage to the central nervous as\nI see to help me understand something though because you know recently been seen me some quite worrying headlines about polio likes him or in some children who are being infected with and you say that and we started started seeing like beginning in two thousand four teams so\nWell but the editor of the virus wasn't wasn't leading can be seen symptoms before that\n[noise] so it turns out that it probably was so if we go back to two thousand twelve there were a few cases reported out of California and the California Department of public health recognize that there were some enter a virus associated acute ... patients\nAnd when we look back even in Dallas uh as far back as two thousand nine it's quite clear that there were some cases the difference between two thousand ten thousand twelve and then what happened in fourteen sixteen and Eighteen was the magnitude of number of cases being recognize\nEnd but the symptoms of syndrome a looks essentially like polio ... which was described well over a hundred years ago before we knew about\nThe polio virus as the predominant cause of this syndrome during the early Nineteen hundreds through the Nineteen forties before we had a vaccine mhm once\nWe essentially got rid of the polio virus within the United states the syndrome of polio ... class at my light as which look almost identical a with a few unique features between them the polio\nBackground of rare paralytic events mainland kids happening for several decades but something has changed whether in the host's us as a population or within the viruses circulating to start causing these much more significant and prevalent outbreaks since two thousand two thousand fourteen\nAnd for that something is what researchers are trying right now to figure out\nHow we are there there are groups all across the United states and indeed around the world because we have seen outbreaks or in Europe as well on the on the a similar pattern where we are trying to determine if there is one or multiple causes a for these ah\nOutbreaks in the late summer early fall and what's notable is the the virus that has received the most attention um which is within the family of viruses all of these viruses are cousins of the polio virus and so while we have not detected the polio virus\nIn any of these cases when testing has been done in a large number of cases we have found a different enter a virus that seems to cause damage to the spinal cord\nOkay here's where medicine and epidemiology get a little bit of had I think a common understanding because I said earlier that\nThe enter the viruses are also very common and ... and maybe some of them are cousins to polio virus but it but if they're still kind of I don't know that there's no current vaccines for the virus which may be causing these these currents spikes of polio syndrome then there are\nCorrect there is no available vaccine for these viruses\nOkay um are we are just wondering if perhaps we need to go down the path of developing one\nIt is a very active conversation that's happening now and where our focus is first in is in trying to prove causation so that if we and when we invest the significant resources it takes to make a vaccine\nWe're picking the right virus to develop a vaccine for and so we're our focus has been for several years is trying to get a consensus\nAmong researchers in public health officials\nThat we think we have the right culprit and\nIt turns out that ah the virus or family viruses that we're most interested in\nAre actually somewhat difficult to capture from these patients they're difficult to isolate and difficult to confirm that the testing for them is not easy and so often will have children who have the syndrome\nVirus we're looking for but it doesn't mean they didn't have it or if we look back to the lessons of the polio virus um when we would test the spinal fluid of a child who is being actively\nParalyzed by this virus and this virus was replicating and their spinal cord and causing damage and affecting the nerves that control the muscles\nWe can't isolate the virus out of the spinal fluid it's a very difficult virus to find\nAnd so when we diagnose the polio virus even today uh we do so by checking a stool specimens because the virus replicates within the gastrointestinal tract so\nIf you have a child with paralysis and you're worried that it could be due to the polio virus we don't look to the final quarter of the spinal fluid because we can't find it we have to look elsewhere in the body\nAnd so we're trying to sort out the same process a use for the center of ours is now the the reassuring part of this relative to the history of polio virus\nIs in the world of polio virus back in the Nineteen thirties the Nineteen forties when we had tens of thousands of children being paralyzed by this virus\nWas that for every hundred to every thousand people who would get infected with this virus somebody would become paralyzed and so it's it's ... sits ability to invade and damage the spinal cord was quite high\nThe best estimates for the enter a virus that we're most concerned about is that it's maybe one in a hundred thousand infection\nSo very very low rate that very low rate and so we are being we're trying to be very reassuring\nTo uh all of the families and parents out there and I'm I'm a father I have two daughters and one of them has a cold right now and I have to remind myself that overwhelmingly the odds are she is not going to suffer a neurologic complication", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018",
