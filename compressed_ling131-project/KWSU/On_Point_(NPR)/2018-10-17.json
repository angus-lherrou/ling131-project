E. N. G. A. G. E. dot com [noise]\nDoesn't on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking about students for fair admissions versus Harvard it's a federal court case going on right now that alleges that Harvard University may discriminate against Asian American students\nBut a lot of people are looking at the casing really what's on trial is affirmative action and we're joined today by Peter would he's president of the national association of scholars there are a group that filed an amicus brief uh this summer in support of students for fair admissions\nRules are joined by Nicole gone ... she's a supervising attorney at Asian Americans advancing\nJustice a coat on what you you just got a quick a quick hit there right at the end of the the previous segment so pick up on your thought I mean ... what do you see this case really as and and do you see any ... any evidence that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans as the plaintiffs are alleging\n[noise] sure so as an Asian American civil rights lawyer that fights discrimination and racism against Asian Americans every day in a variety of contacts [noise]\nOf course I Would be concerned about discrimination against Asian Americans and Harvard's admissions process\nNow the claim here is intentional discrimination and while I Do see that there is some negative effect on Asian Americans in the admissions process based on the data that I have seen I\nNor do I think that it is\nIntentional discrimination I think there is a disparate impact for Asian Americans do two\nLegacies and other preferences that predominantly a benefit white privileged applicants and I also don't think Asian Americans are alone and experiencing the disparate impact on of those policies but can I just jump in here because it's\nBecause the plaintiffs allege that they they see evidence in the thousands of pages of documents that have been released during discovery in this trial that they see evidence\nOf that of a either a disk of discrimination or at least biased against Asian American students in one of the four factors that are that Harvard uses in in admissions they've you know they will get academically look at extracurricular they looked at athletics and they look at\nUm this is this thing called a a personal which is a character and and it's an that personal category that they said ... harbor shows a pattern of marking down Asian American students for for no real reason other than perhaps a\nBias [noise] shore somebody address the personal score issue I think there's a number of things to consider about the personal score so first\nStatistically they're saying that Asian Americans are consistently rated lower on the personal score but that's because of how the Oregon they organized the data so they organize the data by academic death style which is Ninety nine percent based on SAT scores and GPA\nAnd they're saying that\nUm the students in the highest exile who are you know Asian American or whatever they're getting ... lower ... personal scores than other racial groups\nBut I think that it's a mistake to organize that data by academic ... because it doesn't necessarily correlate just because someone anyone Asian American or otherwise\nScores high on the SATs doesn't mean that their application is demonstrating all of these personal qualities and so actually if you don't organize it by academic dial then there is no stick statistically significant difference okay\nPeter would let me turn back to you and sort of a step back here for ... big picture because twice a in terms of when affirmative action has been taken all the way to the United States Supreme court in Nineteen Seventy eight in the ... case and in two thousand three ... three ball injure\nThe way to use racial factors in admissions at the right way to ease racial factors in admissions and that it's not a deciding factor because\nUh there are many thousands of qualified applicants but it it could be a factor that used in in the entire mix yeah they've been held up as as as the right way to do it so what's what's the problem now that easy\n[noise] well first of all the the ... case in Nineteen Seventy eight was a fractured opinion the court split for for one one was Lewis Powell Lewis Powell was the only one who looked to Harvard and fought that its approach to diversity ought to be compelling\nNo other justice agreed with him at that point that remained in the category of Supreme Court Dick to all the way to two thousand three when in the crowd her case Sandra Day O'Connor decided to resurrect polls eccentric opinion and makeup law the land\nSo now yes Supreme Court has not instance said that the pursuit of diversity taking some code of racial preferences\nWould be a a suitable thing that colleges and universities could do not that they had to do it but that they could win and that's where the law stands unless it was reaffirmed in the Fisher case a few years ago\nOn what's at stake here is what's been the steak all along which is should the United states be a country that holds little law the land is titled six of the\nCivil rights act and play teen sixty four that no person in the United states shell on the grounds of race color or national origin be excluded from participation in are denied the benefits to be\nA word to be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance as far as the ending affirmative action we could say that Harvard does have other options\nYou could take the option of saying we no longer want to receive federal aid therefore we're willing to put our money aside in order to discriminate because we'd like to discriminate\nAnother option is that Harvard which has a dominant now thirty nine point one billion dollars could expand and manner that could accommodate the students who are qualified and leap long in as students\nUh Nicole gone to what you want to give you a chance to respond to that\nShow I said I Do want to push back against on just the notion that Asian Americans are definitively\nThat's so I think it is a fiction that\nEvery other score or every other consideration in the admissions process\nIs objective and I think there's a lot of research that establishes that SAT scores and grades even extracurricular activities to some extent\nSystematically penalize black and Latino students um and some subgroups of Asian American students as well and so I think to sort of look at the admissions process and to look at the personal score as the only one that\nCould be potential Tobias it incorrect because all of these doctors are in perfect all of them to some extent are vulnerable to implicit or explicit bias in the case of SAT scores systematic discrimination against certain\nUm you know racial groups and so I don't think that the remedy for any of this is to eliminate the consideration of race but it is actually to have race consciousness and a lot of scholars would tell you\nThat the way to remedy discrimination is to consider race and to make sure that these um that racial groups are treated unfairly compared to ...\nOkay so I Want to take a step back here next to bring in the voice of Harvard University itself because back in July or I had a chance to sit down with Harvard president Larry back how right at the beginning of his his presidency at Harvard\nAnd and we had a long conversation linked to the whole conversation a at on point radio dot org but I'm going to play an excerpt here for you because I Begin by\nAsking Larry back out again Harvard's president about what he sees as the overall mission of Harvard admissions process and is and what it should be an and here's what back out said\nThe admissions process should try to construct a class to bring together a group of students and residential learning environment which optimize has the opportunity for them to learn not just from a faculty bought from each other\nAnd diversity is an important component of that because we learn from our differences\nThem so we focus not just on a narrow definition but a broad definition of excellence the vast majority of students who apply are extraordinarily accomplished academically so we look for excellence and in other dimensions we look for broad intellect\n[noise] support for on point comes from exact science is offering

is calling from New York New York mom and you're on the air\nIs thanks for taking my call and high magna I Love your program I'm calling I'm a with this comment and I have a question at the end and it caught a common as fat I'm In my see here where I live here in New York City\nI worked in a newsroom for my career I'm retired now\nAnd I see the school system in this city\nPublic versus the exceptional schools as apartheid structured\nAnd the other part of this comment is that when you look at the African American community and the history of African Americans in this country that\nAre African Americans have like a ... a ... four hundred year deficit and\nPursuing I'm a equity in this country and that's reflected in our schools if you go into most of the public schools in this in the city of New York or you don't see Asian and white\nMohammed how are you saying that you believe affirmative action is needed then too\nUm level that feel to write the historical inequities\nYes I yes I Do and I think that um I'm an Asian Americans who are dissatisfied with their percentage at a Harvard or have their heads and the sad uh at Harvard ... less than Fifteen Percent of the student body is is African American\nWell let me take it back to me on on on that point and forgive me for interrupting but there are a lot of uh we want to do in like very much appreciate your call oh let's get a different perspective from DJ who's calling from Norwich, Connecticut DJ you're on the air\nThank you for having me on this morning um as far as affirmative action goals you know I think a lot of implicit bias has to do with some of these things I mean yes if it wasn't for affirmative action some things would have never been able to take place\nBut it isn't in the race balancing but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's all for the good you know I grew up in Palm Beach County Florida\nAnd maybe the African American myself I went to someone who is during high school in elementary school where I couldn't move this woman and right there in my community I had to be bused way over here because there wasn't any black students going over there\nAnd my sister's father went to the same thing in it and and during the eating late seventies where it was that to be very violent and things of that nature\nWith Asian Americans with Harvard I think it has to do with the as far as uh some of the personal credit here than in in order to get into school I think that has to do with the fact ah from my experience of them a lot of buildings and yeah I Know about\nThe Asian community they're not very in close up as often as something to do with the about the personal effects but at the same time I think that is a testament to how well they are and how much they are all about the academics as opposed to some of those others\nOkay did you have anything back from either a ... thank you so much for your call Nicole gung ho chi let me just go to you quickly because even though I feel like a I mean uh uh do you do is talking about his experience as an African American male or\nIn this country he also then sort of made some presumptions about the Asian American community as well I just wanted to give you a chance to respond to that\n[noise] sure um yeah I mean I don't really agree ah with DJ that as a group Asian Americans are not very inclusive or you know are more about academic than\nUm than anything else I think that is a stereotype and I think that\nKind of establish is why we need\nThe policies like affirmative action because our country is so segregated that people don't have the opportunity to interact with each other and to break down those stereotypes and that is one of the points of considering race in admissions process and have a diverse\nStudent body at in colleges is though that these barriers can be broken down and what you heard from DJ it was probably the result of him not actually having that many interactions with Asian Americans along the lines of what Mohammed that that there is an apartheid system in our public schools\nSo Peter would let me turn back to you here because I just want to get down and I and we're going to I'm going to ask this question of Nikolas well but she's already spoken about how she believes diversity is is part of what the court to\nAn essential on a experience on American college campuses but if you were to have your druthers what would be the basis upon which colleges and universities in America admit students\nWho would have to admit students on the basis of proven ability aptitude determination self discipline the qualities that make for someone who can undertake a rigorous college curriculum and the full range of things that go on and college who live with him to the maximum\nThe only ... to determine a determination et cetera aren't those uh\nThe ... qualities involved in it as well\nStudents who do well in their academic through grade school and high school and who have transcripts showing that they've excelled in the courses that are available to them and have gone beyond those courses\nAre showing the determination that does not just a matter of somebody subjective opinion about it but it was actually illustrated in their lives lived up to that point\nOkay because I keep going back to what Edward Blum the man who is really the force behind this case what he said it two thousand Fifteen that he said the goal of these lawsuits is to eliminate the consideration of race\nIn applications so he needed plaintiffs he needed Asian plaintiffs now now Edward Blum has a long history of again bringing cases against affirmative action to the Supreme Court he also challenged the Nineteen sixty five voting rights act in Shelby County view holder\nOr and and won that case at the Supreme Court of getting on the court to overturn a very key part of the voting rights act he's been focused on race a lot in America\nBut but what I mean Harvard uses a athletics as part of it's a admissions process is why why should athletes have twice as much chance to get into Harvard as anybody else what does that have to do with their merit there or what about legacy admissions why not bring a case against\nA students who may have a leg up simply because they had a family member who went to Harvard University I mean they feel like there's a lot of other issues apart from race\nThat a separate that the housing that has not have not in the weight Harvard admit admit students\nWell Harvard may be making doubtful decisions when it comes to the preferences gives her luggage sees them for uh people enough flux but those are decisions that a private university republic one for that matter are free to make so\nWhy don't they make the decision also then based on what they see as a mix of students that they need to bring it to have a diverse campus\nBecause this country passed a law through Congress signed by president upheld by numerous Supreme courts which is the um titles six of the um [noise]\nA Nineteen sixty four law and that just makes it plain that to this country discriminating on the basis of race is no go don't do it now if Congress were to pass a law that says they're not going to give preferences for athletes\nWho would be strange law but no such law currently exists this is about Bain\nEli you're on the air [noise] [noise]\nHi Mack now I just wanted to call in because I think a lot of the narrative around this case has been saying that Asian Americans don't believe in affirmative action um a lot of people in the Asian American community do believe in an affirmative action um I'm In East Asian American Woman\nAnd the majority of the plane 'cause he's cases are Chinese American students um and that's you know they're not under represented in the college scene in the slightest\nYou know affirmative action really helps black and brown students in America which Asian American students sometimes I consider ... ... a Pacific Islanders\nI'm South Asian Southeast Asian students you know if this is going to give them a leg up we absolutely owe it to the students to do so and I think this is Kay says really hurting the overall Asian American community to benefit a few students\nWill at least thank you so much for your call let's get a view from Samantha who's calling from La Crosse Wisconsin Samantha
