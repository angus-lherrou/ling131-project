I really appreciate market talk do you draw the connection between the presidents remarks in Montana and what we've all been talking about for ten days or so\nWell um it feels grows to talk about politics in the middle of this but since the midterms are a couple weeks away let's be honest that's the lens through which uh\nEveryone is going to be thinking and discussing every major issue between now and then and I think what Jake and John ah are talking about the last two callers is you know actually can give\n'em a really good reflection of some of the divide in this country right now about why they should care about this issue how much they care about this issue and and and what is it really mean a ... you know I mean the reasons why what happened to somebody who is\nA Saudi man living in the United states a with a contractual relationship from an American newspaper why should anybody care about that it's from a U.S perspective for two reasons number one\nIs the U.S getting played President Trump Jared Kushner has put all of us really almost all of their eggs into the Saudi bask in terms of envisioning how to deal with Iran\nOr who to do business with who to share power and intelligence with\nAh and ah it isn't the right gambit\nAnd number two does the U.S still have I'm Still view itself as having a role in I'm trying to send ... trying to send the right signals about human rights around the world why should the u._s. do this why should the U.S get involved in other people's business well\nAh because to promote democratic ideals and to ah to try to make 'em the rest of the world I'm the kind of place where it's also save to live and be a dissident and express your views on to try to have word around the world and and maybe morality is too big a word but but some\nSense of appropriate global behavior okay\nAnd health care or more than the tax cut debate well they probably don't which is what President Trump is betting on when he tries to energize a crowded in Montana or about a domestic issue and he doesn't believe that uh it will will impact them negatively\nI mean ... how important we think this is geopolitical spaces journalistic basis a moral basis very few people are going to vote on that a hundred percent or less but at the same time for briefly I Want to get at the question of\nDo you think there is a direct line in the rhetoric from what the president says about the congressmen who just before his election assaulted ... American reporter for the guardian and pleaded guilty to that I Believe misdemeanor assault\nA convicted on that are and what he's countenance singer was seemingly kind of hoping to tolerate happened from the hands of a a an ally it from Saudi Arabia\nI'm not going to uh [noise]\nI'm just trying to position to make predictions about what the president's rent or the president's rhetoric in the United states it has caused this in any way or fuel this any way but I Will say that um\nWhen when the president does make remarks suggesting that violence towards journalist is okay American journalists are concerned uniformly not just about the implications that has the United states but about the implications that has another country I\nWanted to a plate you know we should turn to the midterms is coming up quick I Want to play a clip of what the president had to say uh recently here that the the tenor of what he has said in trying to rally the Republican faithful and the base out at rallies in in sequence from Missouri West Virginia and Mississippi just in the past few weeks\nI'm not on the [noise] but I Am I\nVote for me I found among the balance it out\nIn twenty Eighteen because you are voting for me in twenty eight [noise]\nYou're voting for me but then again President Trump told the Associated Press and it makes sense of interview this week he went uh be to blame if the Republicans were to lose the house in November Jack Beatty is Donald Trump on the ballot even if his name isn't there or is he not\nHe certainly is and he was right the first time I'm you know when you look at the election step back to really to elections going on one is in red states the senators and one swing districts the house members in the Senate it looks like the ... the Republican chances according to\nA five thirty eight are four and five of holding the Senate and maybe even gaining some seats are the Democrats only one in ...\nRemarkable for a sort of you know spread of two separate electorate two ... two kinds of elections going on and the elections are happening around the issue crucially of health care\nA thirty percent of Americans more than ... than any other issue

Bloomberg and on point news analyst Jack Beatty\nYou can join the conversation what stories caught your eye this week where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five ... hundred and forty three talk\nYou can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio a couple of listeners weighing in on line I'm Roger hunter at least a listener posting on the name Roger Hunt posed a\nA vet civility and the Democrats and the GOP is long gone the opposition is now the enemy hard to see during these a midterm election season what could bring us together uh another one speaking about the question of what we are expecting President Trump to do a notes\nSays it's worth noting the President Carter's disastrous legacy\nIncluding a strong emphasis on human rights which in part led to the overthrow of the shot in Iran and its evolution to fifteenth century theocracy a as described there a couple of listeners weighing and I wanted to turn to another element of the midterm elections which at the question of turnout and frankly turned out to Latino voters\nDemocrats talk about this a lot I think are in Texas they'd been staking that the idea that ... or a work would somehow benefit from that his\nHe is fluent in Spanish appealing to with Latino voters are\nUh are said to be even though a his opponent Texas Senator Ted Cruz is of Cuban descent\nAh Fernando bizarro how important is a Latino turnout to Democrats and how well are they doing it in trying to accomplish that\nTeen Latino turnout was very very low is twenty seven percent than twenty sixteen went up twenty percentage points um [noise]\nPew um has a pure research has panic trends came out this week with their\nWith numbers on the you know a vote this chair they they are saying that there's a record uh they they estimate twenty nine million eligible Latino voters but the key word here is eligible not registered um it's it's been low in talking about Texas there's a five point four million\nEligible voters and Latino voters in Texas a back door probably needs that but you know it's sometimes it's really hard to to define a if ...\nOff I'm interested in glee for instance Univision just a interviewed last week both candidates and and and ... he always does with Spanish language media didn't in Spanish a Ted Cruz didn't um he never liked to talk in Spanish in public\nUh but I think it's very important to see what the what the turnout it was going to be traditionally it tends to be disappointing the national association of Latino elected officials which is an authority on on on the Latino vote as well\nWill come out next week would there a year I'm not yearly every two years um their their projection and all that teen vogue we might get a clearer picture than but that this again and we'll we'll dependable hands on on the turnout\nAh Fernando other in a couple of other races that you point to is that in which you think that's going to be politically important [noise]\nWhile we have Florida ah and I think Florida it's very interesting that much has been talked about um the influx of Puerto Ricans and Florida and we tend to think about it I think that conventional wisdom tends to think about Hurricane Maria\nAnd all the people who who left Florida may be temporarily and who have I'm Sorry I left the island and settled in Florida I'm temporarily all over the country as well but mainly in Florida particularly on the Orlando area there's a\nStory that I saw this week that nearly Seventy eight thousand Puerto Ricans have registered in Florida\nUh the question is and we and as I said before I mistakenly we tend to think of these\nPuerto Rican I'm moving to Florida just as a consequence of Hurricane Maria but no that's not the case there's been a a population train and Puerto Rico for the last three years or more since the fiscal crisis in the island hit really hard and people have been leaving and many of them have been settling\nIn in in Florida so we'll see what the difference is going to be particularly in the ... and the race for governor\nI'm In South Florida it's there's a different dynamic you know the Latino bases well entrenched there that are been some changes of course demographic changes in some of those ... districts that are turning more democratic then\nThen the then the Cuban Americans who would tend to vote more Republican have wanted but there's I think still they have some safe seats in there but\nBut it's the key vote for the Puerto Ricans would make may make a difference in other parts of the state during an interview with CBS this morning on Wednesday\nTurn out in the mid term because numbers have shown that the rate is at what he said it's not what it should be\nI think what it's going to take to change that his campaign dawn six months before an election for by any one or two candidates it's going to take folks investing in a massive and sustained effort\nTo care for the animals registered and then it turned out to vote\nAnd until that happens I don't think that the numbers are going to move it\nMargaret television seems to be that almost every cycle we shared the importance of Latino voters in the idea there's going to be a surge but there is a even if there's greater registration there's not a huge edition of of protein of voters what's your sense of all this\nI was really struck by one of your callers earlier actually left in the middle of the question not to be disrespectful them but because it resonated with me so much he said he was so frustrated by the ... of\nDifferent narratives about what's really going on in the midterms and I think you know everybody is asking the right questions which is that ... are the Republicans who voted for Trump to listen to the ads are they going to go out and vote for their\nCongressmen or will they turn you know what's the Latino vote going to be what about young voters typically\nIn the past is very low for young voters are they energize they say they're energized and actually going to turn out what about the non college women what about the college educated women and I you know I the the polling attempts to measure uh a snapshot in time but you could say something three weeks before an election and then just\nWake up that Tuesday Morning and say you know and that's what the term question has always been so these questions are really important the president and many Republicans\nHave a I have at least been probably talking a good game about believing that things are swinging in their favor that Republicans could hold the house and\nAnd I think some Republicans see this caravan of Hondurans who have been moving up through Guatemala and Mexico as something that could actually help them a ... kind of a counterintuitive thought so we have a lot in play here but\nUh the question really does when it's all of a sudden doesn't come down to what individual people do um either for absentee voting or in terms of going to the polls that day\nI Want to actually play a clip of a couple of a Honduran migrants who spoke to CNN this week there's ... and I'm Andrea\nI lame on they spoke to CNN this week about why they're making that track from Honduras towards the United states there's much corruption here in Honduras we want to work there is no we want them to plant banana plantations being there isn't any brother we need to migrate to another country\nWe're heading to the United states we're going to arrive with Donald Trump he has to receive a\nA you heard there the voices of those migrants speaking through an interpreter is on on on CNN or Fernando bizarro a vis a caravan it's obviously intended to create a tension or what are the repercussions of it well the repercussions\nCan be many obviously we could have a second family separation policy as it was suggested by the administration and reported last week that they are considering a new policy in which in a way that they would give somewhat of a\nVoluntary separation option to these families once they were detained but this is mostly right now in the works we we still do not know the details of this but if I may give some some context to this care of and I think there are some politics involved I mean you interview I've seen many of the interviews that people that are coming up and there is a truly need\nTheir people escaping their people looking for better jobs are people looking for ... the people who have been threaten\n'em there's violence and the and the countries of the northern triangle which are an Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador [noise]\nBut I Want to give some context to this this this caravan left some better Sula Honduras it day after last Saturday it day after a two
