also joined today by Bernard Haykel professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University\nA and a professor heckle you before the break you said what it's worth exploring further this question of a President Trump's relationship\nWith the house of doubt and then perhaps we should even focus on Jared Kushner in his relationship with crown prince Mohammed ah been some on I mean how would you describe how close they are\n[noise] well you you probably know that the first overseas trip that President Trump took was to Riyadh yeah where he was um cited in and received you know as a great kind of international statesmen and he you know seem to appreciate that\nI'm a lot um and then a special relationship developed which are the president's son in law\nISIS and the ... campaign at the other was the Israeli Palestinian peace process\nAnd lastly was of the uh relationship the business and economic relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia and this was at a time when the Saudis where\nI'm ... and still are reforming diversifying their economy they want us to invest in the United states they want to buy a lot of things from the U.S and build strong connections with us institutions\nBanks universities et cetera so that relationship is is is a very personal and titan one and I think um and this is my speculation but I think that a significant amount of the ah attention an anger that has been directed at Saudi Arabia has to do with\nUm the feelings that many Americans feel about President Trump\nOK well Steven Cook of the ... the president has said that he would vow quote severe punishment right if if a Saudi or influence or out of Saudi Arabia is proven to be behind the death of ... uh but at the same time the president said he doesn't want a\nThat punishment to affect arms sales for example or at least ... billion dollars in arms sales to the Saudi Government so what permission to put the president and\nThe president certainly been all over the place on this issue as you point out I I think his statements\nHave a be in an effort to provide time for the Turks and the Saudis to figure out a story\nI think it's abundantly clear that the president is in an awkward position and his inclination is actually to continue the relationship with Saudi Arabia a uninterrupted\nI think that the statement about severely punishing the Saudis\nWas or something where the White House was acknowledging a the pressure and a two weeks for commentary about the disappearance of democracy joke tea\nUm but uh overall uh this is a president who has I'm not made human rights a a priority and hum has looked upon a Washington relations with other countries particularly countries in the middle east and particularly Saudi Arabia\nAs a very important for American commercial transactions and he has mentioned a hundred and ... ... a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal uh which actually was not struck by the Trump Administration but was actually agreed to under the Obama administration but signed up\nYou're right it's a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal but but it's not point Steven Cook I mean we\nWe can talk about uh the economic ties between Saudi Arabia and the United states but they're also strategic very deep strategic elements this long standing relationship between these two countries I mean how sensual of an ally is Saudi Arabia in the region and just that\nAh that does that sort of essential nature make it is that the thing that has allowed multiple administrations to talk about human rights on one hand but overlook human rights violations by the Saudis on the other\n[noise] well that has long been the dilemma for American policymakers when looking at Saudi Arabia as well as quite frankly other countries in in the middle east\nI'm ... and Saudis importance it really depends on how you look at the middle east right now a given the fact that the Trump Administration regards Iran as it's number one priority encountering Iranian influence around the region\nIn Saudi Arabia is critically important to the to the United states you've had 'em Egypt which has lurched from one crisis to another really can't project power around the region\nOr many of the other countries um are too small um to play a leading role as America's ally they can be part of a an American regional order\nA but a Saudi Arabia really is the the big country it's the custodian of the two holy mosques which gives it a certain legitimacy in in the Muslim world it is a large producer of a of of oil it's not the largest any longer the United states is\nUm but still many of a Washington is most important allies were trading partners do rely upon\nA oil from Saudi Arabia and the fact that the United states is interested in in a global capitalist water or the fact that the Chinese the Koreans the Japanese the Indians are are all depended upon oil coming out of this region in significant portions of it coming from Saudi Arabia\nThe United states has a a a compelling interest uh in Saudi Arabia stability and supporting Saudi Arabia security well I think\nSo I just wanted to get it's okay I just want to get Bernard Haykel you in on this for for professor he called for as long as there's this unified approach between the United for between Washington and in Riyadh in terms of their view of the Iranian threat\nDoes that make it impossible to imagine a significant break between ... between these two countries between the United states and Saudi Arabia\nEven though President Trump seems to characterize it as a transactional relationship\nThat the relationship with Saudi Arabia you know started in Nineteen forty five\nIt was ... they were instrumental in the Cold War and the fight against communism their instrumental in regulating the global oil market which is a fungible and global market which means that if any disruption happens in Saudi Arabia even if we are entirely self sufficient in the United states we would feel the effects\nIn terms of price immediately they are fundamentally important the Saudis for the stability of the of the region which has been a longstanding American\nOr an interest in this part of the world you also have Iran you have Islam you have to fight against ah the the radical Islamists the Saudis are instrumental again in fighting against radical Islamism and in particular\nAt a moment been from an MBA or\nBecause he has made it a policy of the kingdom to turn away from a Islamism and towards nationalism and populism\nAnd that again is you know very important for the United states because if he if he succeeds in Saudi Arabia that would set a pattern for the entire region right there are many reasons for this relationship and it it transcends either Trump or MPs\nI Want to play a clip here are on sort of how that tension is playing out amongst other uh leaders in Washington on CBS his face the nation on Sunday Republican Senator Marco Rubio said that the United states relationship with Saudi Arabia goes beyond that a hundred and ten billion dollars in arms deals we were talking about\nI Would just say it's unfortunate because Saudi Arabia is an important part of our Middle Eastern strategy they are a key leverage and heads point against Iranian influence in the region but that cannot supersede our commitment to human rights\nSteven Cook what does the United states\nStands to lose perhaps morally if that's the right approach to take care Bye bye this continuing Carlos relationship with with Saudi Arabia I mean we have\nThe listeners online who's who's talking to us about what about uh you know remembering the the terrorists that came from Saudi Arabia after nine eleven and again in Yemen comes up over and over again there's a U.S a hundred year famine that Yemen is facing the worst humanitarian catastrophe\nA ... in the world right now largely driven by Saudi bombing there I mean it does not the United states stand to lose something by\nI don't want to call it an unquestioning relationship but it's so cold and Clinton type relationship well\nThis is the central dilemma for American policymakers who want to ah to secure America is\nUm it has allies in the region who will do things that are run counter to American values and oftentimes with American ...

journalist ... gee\nWe're joined by Steven Cook a senior fellow for Middle East and African studies at the council on Foreign Relations and my Bernard Haykel he's professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University\nAnd we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk and let's go to some callers here Dolores is calling from Waterford, Pennsylvania you're on the air Dolores\nHigh magna and hello to your gas up before I have a couple of questions I like to make a point I I'd if anyone wants to get some good insight into the kingdom of Saudi Arabia they need to read my now Sharif's book daring to drive it's a good insight\nUm it's a good read and it provides a an eye opening\nA exposure to how these guys operate oh here's my question I mean who is going to believe who in their right mind is going to believe that this was conducted by a rogue element you had an individual show up with a bone saw if you I mean to me that's a signal you intended to conduct\nSome sort of nefarious this had been premeditated and my other point\nIn his ... seconds so those reports for the only the only source for those reports are Turkish officials are unnamed Turkish officials so we haven't actually been independently confirmed it just I just want to remind folks of that but go ahead oh\nOkay and hear Donald Trump\nIs the one who has claimed that the media is the enemy of the people and only not only speculating of course 'cause I don't have evidence but in my mind is I'm looking at this and you have you know the world leader\nClaiming that the media is the enemy of the people I mean an MBA circle they think well what shall we can take this guy out who's going to care ...\nI mean I personally I think Trump could care less about her show in that interview on the White House lawn yesterday was you know another act it's another lie I mean I Am hoping\nThat Congress ... you know\nAnd it showed a global daycares that maybe they have a friend and Donald Trump a gift and Donald Trump attacked the U.S Congress is going to start taking some action against these human rights violations that are occurring around the globe will\nDelivers thank you for your calls Steven Cook let me turn turn that to you a first of all ... to ... assertion that the president's own rhetoric against journalists may have emboldened a folks like the crown prince of Saudi Arabia [noise]\nYeah and this is something that has been part of the commentary since uh the first reported missing of Jim up choked gee I'm In I think that it's certainly\nIt's unfortunate that the president in refers to the press as the enemy of the people ah it certainly underscores for dictators around the world that the the White House will will downplay attacks on the media but let's also be clear\nUm people like Vladimir Putin's Turkey's president reject type or won a others around the world the Chinese um are are arresting journalists harming journalists\nSo one can imagine that uh if this decision was made at the highest ah levels in Saudi Arabia they looked around the world and they saw how the Russians are killing people in small British pounds a in Dupont Circle Washington DC Dupont Circle who tells the Chinese are rounding up people turkey the leading jailer of journalists in the world\nNone of those countries have paid a price for that and that ah the Saudis must to believe that they wouldn't pay a price either so I think yes in part it does have to do with a President Trump's rhetoric but I also think it is in the international environment\nThat transcends a that transcends President Trump\nOkay I'm going to explore that a little more in the second specifically regarding some of the things that ... gene himself had has set about a\nA crown prince Mohammed bin Salman but Steven Cook there was a point that you mentioned a much early in the program that I should have dug deeper in into and that is\nUm how much does the president's personal business interests in Saudi Arabia first of all what are they specifically and how much do you think that is influencing\nOr his approach to this current diplomatic crisis [laughter] [noise]\nWell there's all kinds of allegations concerning the president and his family's business ties with Gulf monarchies I'm I'm not aware that there's a Trump International hotel in Riyadh um but\nA continuing question whether ah the president is making decisions based on his family's a personal financial interests or on behalf of the United states\nUm we do know that um the the government of Qatar through a an investment fund\nHas invested in a building in New York City that was in tremendous debt that's owned by the Cushman company has\nCut their in Saudi Arabia are at odds so um there's a lot of different uh business interests and it's very very hard to pinpoint specifically about how the president is making decision on on these issues I think any president in United States would be in a tremendously awkward position\nWith allegations coming from a a a NATO ally like turkey that the Saudis a strategic ally in the middle east had murdered someone and they're constantly and in in Turkey is you know main city\nOr how the president would respond to that anybody occupying the oval office would be trying to weigh the ... how much to emphasize a values and freedom of the press and protections for the ...\nVersus a relationship with a country like Saudi Arabia well\nAnd look the Saudis spend a lot of money in Washington right the Washington Post is reporting that Saudi Arabia plowed twenty seven million dollars into lobbying in Washington Jeff last year making it one of the highest spending country seeking to influence U.S policy that's according to\nPublic record uh well let's take another call here said is calling from Green Bay Wisconsin said you're on the air\nUh hello I Am calling to rent an alarm bell on the on over reaction to the a harsh of the situation\nI'm In terms of spending to the political domestic political forces and international Middle Eastern countries themselves the greatest violators of human rights who are trying to exploit the situation in order to affect American foreign policy\nI remind us all of a similar situation we were in in Nineteen Seventy six or the merger with new American president Jimmy Carter who invites the\nCentral piece of his foreign policy for Tyson pressure on the ... on a on his human rights record\nResulting displacement and the conversion of the coast American ally that he must have been to the greatest American Fall and a significant deterioration of human rights or in Iran result taking over a million Iranians get seven million in exile and the Seventy million living under tyranny\nIs what happens when\nAnd does not understand the strategic dimensions that are involved in that in in our relations\nSaid thank you for your call a Bernard Haykel what is how do you respond to said\nWell I I think he makes a good point and the and and the story that he tells about Iran is a it's it's certainly true um I I think that uh you know the point that he's trying to make as far as Saudi Arabia is concern is that there is a very important strategic relationship here\nUm that the that the states that are engaged in let's say the Turks are with their campaign of of uh of leaks ah some of which may be disinformation we don't know whether they're true or not the Turks are allies with the Qataris who hate the Saudis the Turks and the Saudis arrivals\nUm the Iranians are rivals to the Saudis so one has to be really careful uh in coming to a conclusions about what to do as a result of of this tragic episode I think that the most important things to focus on if a crime was committed to get people punished for the crime\nBut not to jeopardize the relationship that we have that the United states has with its strategic allies in the region because the repercussions of let's say undermining Saudi Arabia and causing\nA the weakening of the regime there could be a civil war and let's not forget that in the middle east we have four or five failed states with lots of war is raging and similar one or you know God Forbid in Saudi Arabia would lead us to a military intervention possibly in in this region and that's not something we want to get involved", "year":
