make of trial balloons from the White House about sending troops to the border tightening asylum laws where one hundred for two three eight to five five that's one hundred forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio my guests today are Daniel Dale is to Toronto Star\nSung Kim was the Washington Post and of course our own news analyst shirt on point Jack Beatty up some and the president has talked a lot this week about the caravan of migrants wending its way about a thousand miles south of the U.S border\nOr in Central America south of even of Mexico at this point ah [noise] that that is certainly gotten a lot of news coverage and it's a very real issue on the other hand I'm\nIn the president's framing of it as part of a ... as an issue of vital national security concern is it the sense that there is something that the president needs to address on a federal level\nThe sense that there that the government needs to take action but it is important to point out the facts here that this caravan while it is traveling we've talked the latest an estimate from Mexican officials and that it is about more than nine hundred\nMiles south of the U.S Mexico border so it is still significantly far away um you know experts in the region and on the issue has said for a long time that these are people who are you know speak or who are fleeing from violence and terrible conditions in their home countries\nAnd trying to find refuge in the United states and that\nYou know the vast majority of these or asylum seekers who will try to obtain legal status inside the United states um I Do want to point out one new development that broke last night that the administration is considering invoking a national um basically they're national security powers and then a national security rationale\nTo block um you know people at the border who come here to seek asylum it's ... they're considering using kind of the same\nNational security rationale that they use to invoke the travel ban and the different iterations of the travel ban and the early part of his presidency which I Do want to point out the the final determination of that band was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court and one option that the administration is now considering doing that on the southern border\nUm you know experts say you know under US law you have to you know if someone presents themselves at the border as someone seeking asylum you have to let them apply for asylum\nBut the administration does appear to be testing how far that national security his national security powers can go on in addressing this issue at the border which clearly we've seen the president become more I'm more focused on in these last several days and weeks\nDuring a bill or our listeners may or may not know that I'm as well as reporting for the star from Washington you kind of bird dog the statements from the president from major officials are pretty much in real time and rather extraordinary way\nOn Tuesday vice president Mike Pence bolstered or the president's claim that there are unknown middle Easterners mixed in\nWith Central American migrants moving toward the U.S border here's what the first person to\nUnited States of America intervenes in preventing them terrorists or suspect suffers from coming into our country every day so it's just inconceivable that there was no individuals' of from the middle east\nThe caravan\nThey've been hugely inaccurate I mean you could teach that statement in like a logic class um you know he he doesn't ... made a statement that is arguably factual different based on department of homeland security statistics about people on terror walking as being prevented from entering the country and then made it completely unfounded link a leap\nFrom that to the care of and you know just because ten terrorists or suspected terrorists or let the terrorists are prevented from entering the country um had no obvious connection to people are trying to walk into the country from Honduras Guatemala\nAnd so I think consistently the president at first and then joined by the vice president and others in the ministry shouldn't\nUm has made logical leaves and completely baseless claims about this ... that had no grounding in ... in reality at all\n[noise] Jack Beatty is there nothing to the idea that that we should be concerned about the ... the borders I mean there seems to have been a significant rise a number of people in recent years have been seeking asylum\nWe certainly should be concerned about it but we should be concerned under the age of civil law laws which involve the right to seek asylum in the United states\nYou know what's going on here is the politics of fear of which Mr Trump is a master during the two thousand campaign he let it out he said real power is I don't want to use the word see here\nHe's playing on fear\nA year of the nation under attack by brown skinned people coming up from the south\nAnd reporters have talked to people as far north as Minnesota there was an interview and the times with a woman in Minnesota who said you know\nIf these people aren't stop their libel to come up here in Minnesota and to be going into the cabins that that uh people have is summer homes and and staying there for the winter and then when the people\nWho ... who come in the summer they'll be these these are these migrants will be living in their cabins course they'd have to walk the thousand miles to the border and then the Fifteen hundred miles to\nTo uh to Minnesota but this this this is what's here is the magnification of deep seeded American anxieties especially among conservatives about keeping the country you know ...\nWe've got a call from El Paso Texas John is calling that John my understands you do some work down there that's related to this\nNew or they take my call we we work with\nMake it into our country we're disgusted with what you people and the media have been doing a we're sick of your rhetoric at a press\nAnd we're not going to happen not going to share what we do advocate has its good discourse back and forth in and just disagreement a in a civil way but we're not we're not going to have people abusing each other on the air or we are going to return however to one of the comments that uh that I Want to follow up with Daniel Dale it's Toronto Star\nA and think about the question she flagged questions about uh statements made by the president other members ... that he'd been burned on 'cause a lot of them weren't factual here's a or just Wednesday a couple of days ago\nFormer White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci went on the air uh\nAnd she called President Trump his man he advises a liar he then went on Bloomberg TV yesterday to clarify that what he meant was that the president was an intentional ladder\nYes the president's speaking ms truth yes the president is lying but he's doing it intentionally\nTo incite surf in people which would include left leaning journalists and most of the left leaning politicians and so what ends up happening is they come out like a hall monitor and the elementary school or junior high schools\nAnd they say oh wow the president's lying and his face is basically laughing at him okay if someone's taking your lunch money in the cafeteria if you call the hall monitor it's not going to help you okay you got to defeat the person at the table with your peer group\nSo Daniel Dale as ... a compares a sort of fact checkers people are doing real time ah verifying of information given to the public by their leaders as hall monitors\nA recently also a trolley or worse old of a a bug speed posted a piece where he says look depressed is participating in a cycle of um\nDisseminating miss truths or to the public even as doing fact checking here's what he says he says to the cycle feeds itself simply by virtue of the media reporting on the president\nTrump lives at a rally or by tweeter press conference the press reports that he lies Trump tells his supporters the media's unjustly attacking him his supporters believed that news organizations dinner perpetuating and feeling Trump's claims simply by amplifying and checking his statements what do you make of that\nThere are a lot of thought there um I I think the problem is actually the opposite I still think there is insufficient fact checking and truth telling you about the president's lies I don't think it has regularly if the case that the media\nTo win a media hatred among Trump supporters I think many Trump supporters dislike the media for reasons entirely separate from the fact checking I think many of them are not reading are fact checking and I think the only alternative to\nUm to calling out the president for his lives in letting those line stand unchallenged wedding got information\n[noise]\nThe music emporium guitar seller since Nineteen sixty

is on point I'm David Folkenflik\nWe're discussing the week in the news you can join the conversation why wasn't making Kelly's apology enough to safer how severe are mild should the U.S response speed that Saudi Arabia is ever shifting acknowledgement of blame in the ... killing where one hundred forty three eight to five five ... hundred for two three talk\nYou can also follow us on Twitter find this on Facebook and on point radio\nMy guests today are Daniel Dale Toronto Star sung Kim of the Washington Post and on point news analyst Jack Beatty\nSo uh one of these stories playing out in the last couple of days are involved are making Kelly who on Tuesday\nOr made comments as simply defending people dressing up white people I should be clear dressing up in blackface for Halloween on Wednesday making Kelly opened her NBC morning show making Kelly today with an apology for what she had had to say\nHi Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry he made her they answered a we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another\nBlack person making their face later or white person making errors darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it and that was respectful and part of a Halloween costume it's old okay well I was wrong and I am sorry\nOn my other lifetime other media correspondent for NPR News and I last night reported a that a person with direct knowledge of the matter said that her show was gone from NBC she would not be hosting the today show and that she was involved\nIn essentially exit negotiations with the network all of that has not played out yet some and Kim what do you make of the networks response to her remarks um ah that that we just heard\nOn I think it says that I mean there was as fires time as criticism after her initial comments on on the today show and I think I was watching the Clinton it seemed like some of her ...\n... I you know I don't cover the media that endeavor pointing that out there in our publication and in other news outlets on that that had at NBC News Andy lack how the town hall shortly thereafter those comments and sad and really condemned those comments according to sources were there and who told us another\nAnd other news outlets I think that's why the the games aren't as they ... they had to do at this point\nUh I Want to thank you I Know some men you have to dash uncover a few days to thank you for joining us that's a voice of sung Kim of the Washington Post thanks for having me I Want to take a couple of calls about making Kelly uh we've got a call from Tampa, Florida cargo head\nGuy I'm I Am as sensitive as anyone else or I'm a ... there's\nA black guy to for the call I think that um sometimes on the on on the roof ... as we can go over the top uh I really don't think that there's anything that a ... you had to apologize I come from a society which we have\nA class of ... well yeah\nI Do a paint their faces and all types of shows no sign of any re shoe connotation\nIf you if you if you work on that rule would you go unless you're going to be able to do nothing\nIs absolutely ridiculous I Wonder whether NBC had another a jet and got what they wanted to get rid of low on use this as an excuse\nWell thank you so much for that call call call I appreciate it very much it's worth pointing out and perhaps not incidental that making Kelly's ratings were were not strong a and that her embrace by our colleagues even prior to this incident was not warm we've got another call on this subject from Omaha Nebraska rich go ahead\nI um yeah about Megan Kelly I I I think I I I'm not a fan of backing Kelly I'm but you know in in hearing reports about how this all came about [noise] um I think uh we all make mistakes are especially on the air\nUm and it's no different than a you know a story that comes out from the news service and they have to retract the story a she made a mistake she apologized or I don't think there was anything malicious about her intense\nAh so I I really don't think uh they have taken the right course of action um\nWell I I very much appreciate your input on that rich important here thank you so much a Jack Beatty you know obviously the question of blacks\nOf the way in which white says I not only treated blacks or over the decades and centuries but how they've depicted them at the same time making Kelly said she was unaware of the full scope of that history and her apology how does the decision of NBC to essentially a park with her I sit with you [noise]\nWell it's not so much Howard sits with me is how it fits with the American public a in a massive study called hidden tribes to study of America's polarize landscape just recently released\nA group called more in common they they interview that fold eight thousand people they had an hour long interviews focus groups et cetera et cetera\nOn the question of political correctness and bite eighty percent\nOf Americans of all stripes say it is a problem in the country ah three that includes three quarters of African Americans includes Seventy nine percent of young people where you tend to think political correctness\nIs rife the only group in the in the tribes of America as a divided here\nThat thinks political correctness understood however you want to put it a is a good thing by a majority are eight percent of the population and these are defined as progressive activists they are very affluent they have a very white and they are often highly educated\nBut they're all by themselves and that's what he ... he decided he calls them team walk\nThat's not what the what the whole American public feels they don't like political correctness on the other hand eighty two percent of Americans think hate speech is a problem so the American public doesn't like political correctness I'm not saying that this was an example of it but it will be called that and they don't like\nA hate speech either\nTenure daily you know it's interesting we we heard a lot about political correctness on the campaign trail back in twenty sixteen and it seems like it's popped up in some races maybe a quarter Stewart dishonor dog race in Virginia against a democratic Senator Tim Kaine how much is a a racial resentments\nAnd how much is the question of political correctness of influencing some of the uh the political races you're you're tracking around the country\nThink it having a significant impact or at least Republicans are trying to make it happen significant impact in quite a number of house races than than Corey Stewart kind of race in Virginia as an obvious example um you know he is wrap himself and the Confederate flag almost literally Mr Stewart I'm but I think\nThey're trying to make in various races they are in several cases trying to tie their democratic opponents to terrorism I'm In one case a there are in in New York state they are emphasizing the fact that a Rhodes Scholar who's running for the Democrats\nUm was once a rapper who use profanity in his in his political music um and and so these I think are quite subtle appeals to bigotry or or generously\nRacial resentment um and it's either that they feel that this is a a compelling message to many voters or that this is their best message I'm In a in a very challenging for them\nAnd ... have been questions of whether race informs some of the arguments we've heard about of of voting rights and voter access a during this election season a subject we've covered on this show but nonetheless one that keeps having new fresh fresh revelations every every day or so\nI think about the Georgia race how does race in form a out what's happening governor's race what's happening in terms of voting rights there\nWell I think great race to the huge factor as it often isn't something racism and many other races um you know we have a as a female African American candidate running for the Democrats\nYes we have a a white male candidate running for the Republicans the white male candidates also happen to be the secretary of state of the state I'm basically in charge of election issues uh and as usual we found that many of the people who are being\nA you know drop from the rolls or otherwise being blocked or discouraged from voting are disproportionately members of minorities particularly African Americans and so in in multiple ways it was impossible to separate race from from that George I group and tore all race\nOr one of the
