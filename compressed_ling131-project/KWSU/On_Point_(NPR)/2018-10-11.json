I mean I Know that you either you or a gym or setting prices for drugs that are are that are coming out of clinical trial I Want to acknowledge that ah and also we've heard frequently over the many years and and Jim just pointed to it that the development costs are these drugs are very high because sometimes we were talking about decades of research so\nThat point also should be made but on the other hand I mean you both of you are in the world of cancer research are you concerned that as we have these potentially very game changing therapies coming out of the pipeline\nBut because their costs are so high it could further sort of drive a wedge between the haves and have nots it when it comes to availability and access to to health care in the United states\nWell that went in there now ... you know and and it's terrible and it's something that concerns us every day and you know I I think it's a broader discussion than just the cost of some very expensive new ... you know transformative drugs\nIt's the cost of our entire healthcare system in the United states and how are we going to focus\nWhat we can do as doctors and his researchers is to focus on getting exactly the right therapies to the right patients in the best most efficient way\nBecause then it's it's not so unreasonable to justify what that's going to cost what what really concerns me even more in when we have wasted in the system or when it's inefficient or when we don't have the ability to understand who's going to benefit and has not and really as as clinicians researchers that's where our focus is\nOkay well let's go to Lizzie who's calling from Jupiter, Florida Lizzie you're on the air\nHello Hi Lindsay go ahead\nOh hi thank you for taking my call 'em I wanted to counter all this talk of excitement with my experience of frustration over me into therapy I'm fifty two years old I was diagnosed with advanced stage three ovarian cancer which statistically the terrible survival rate on like all the very very very lucky\nIt's not for me and so my question to your researcher it's for someone like me\nHow many years I have to try to stay alive you can conventional methods of treatment until someone comes up with an e that's got pro in my life [laughter] you know at ...\nHang on don't don't hang up the phone here let me just turn to Jim Allison first or you have you ever as well as\nFor her yeah I mean one of one of the rich talking about um you know set up is because there's a lot of cancers that were uniformly fatal before\nA bitter now responding unfortunately they don't respond to a group of us do among them rather transfer for example the IRS votes really have not responded much at all yet on ovarian as one which doesn't respond with the frequency revise gym so\nWhat we're involved in here or to an end our misery platform was really studying oh poor goes wrong not only in patients that are successful therapies with impatience that receive combinations that don't work and try to figure out what's missing\nThem in a minute irrational why are the things that are missing and try to you know move move it forward movement makes it more effective than\nWe were talking about a few cancers Arbor sort of over as one where we used to have made it very far\nNo Lizzie Lizzie did I hear you correctly when you say that you've been searching for a clinical trial to participate in but you can't find one of one that you call it that will that you qualify for\nUm yeah that's correct I found one but I don't think they're saying it's a vaccine but it's like ... which I think that's different from you know therapy but it's also one where there's a fifty percent chance that don't get a placebo uh-huh rat out with a vaccine same thing and then you know therapy as a\nUnit for Scott different kinds of administrative\nMonica weren't nearly I mean what would what would you would guidance for advice would you ... have really because I imagine that there are many other people like her out there who would like to have access to these treatments even in the clinical trial phase but for whatever reason cannot well you know\nYou have two questions you know I've tuitions first Lizzie thank you so much for calling in and for", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "11"}
