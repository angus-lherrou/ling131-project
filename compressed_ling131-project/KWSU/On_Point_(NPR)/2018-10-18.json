L. E. Y. traveled dot com [noise]\n\nOn point I'm making a trucker ... we're talking this hour about a Trump Administration proposal to require pharmaceutical companies to disclose the list price\nOf their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising the hope the idea is that that kind of price transparency could eventually bring costs down but there is significant debate about whether or not that is indeed what would happen\nAnd we are joined today by Dr Michael ... he is vice president of medical affairs at farmers that is the trade and lobbying group representing the pharmaceutical industry in America he's also an emergency room physician and he's with us from washing today and we definitely want to hear from you about one eight hundred for two three eighty five five it's eight hundred and four to three\nTalk uh Mike Lee borrow there's\nThis is kind of a basic question I Want to ask when they need to provide a little bit of background for listeners who are to do that so first of all I'm seeing here is that uh the department of health and Human Services says that the drug industry has spent more than five and a half billion dollars on advertising in two thousand Seventeen\nNearly four point two billion of that on television at an age age has also\nBased on messaging which increase government cost\nSo I'm going to pursue that if pharmaceutical companies are spending more than four billion dollars on television advertising that perhaps there's some truth to what ha just to say that it can influence patient choices\nSo if they if the advertising is that effective\nI I just want to get to why this the farm industry is is resisting the idea of having some price trans transparency in those ads is one of the best ways to inform patients I mean you're informing them about all the potential benefits of the drug why not informed them of the material cost\nSo I think two things number one I don't think it impacts per se choices I think it does impact awareness though what I think ads are meant to do\nIs raise awareness about a particular disease and lead a patient to have a conversation with their physician\nAnd I can say direct to consumer advertising pharmaceuticals is one thing that brings patient to the physician's office but in the emergency department people come you know after seeking information from a wide array of sources I mean folks and Google you know symptoms folks are reading Web MD they're getting information from a wide variety of sources\nSo I think all of the kind of mass media that we have today you know leads to increased awareness that doesn't necessarily lead to that might not be the right medicine for the patient you know it may just be the start of a conversation and at the end of the day it's really up to the to the physician you know working with the patient understanding their concerns making the best decision for the patient\nSo that's kind of number one the second thing I'll say is that you know we do agree that transparency is important I think the point I'm I just would like to make is it really needs to be paired with with the health literacy effort which is why the company's I'm a agreed voluntarily to join the updated direct to consumer advertising principals\nSo that it's not just the list price that doesn't have added context it also has information on potential out of pocket costs for that patient as well as where they can go to get financial assistance they need it and that was the point I was trying to make just about you know patients when they are I'm faced with situation stressful situations\nUm if you're diagnosed with a serious illness like cancer hepatitis are HIV ... we don't want people to be making decisions solely based on a list price that really doesn't reflect the complexity of the system\nUm there are tremendous amount of discounts that are negotiated in fact there are some discount that are written into law on Medicaid has a required just kind of mandatory discount that has to be given\nUm how would that be reflected in the TV I Would that lead to medicate mission to to delay care when when there's discounts built into law there yeah there's a the VA has discounts there's discounts negotiated between private insurance companies pharmacy\nThere's no doubt that the complexity of the system is satirist a but I've just I've just got a comment here from a listener Facebook a Betty and sharp who says transparency is a good start but it is not enough what will work is if we stop marketing to the public would you agree well I I go back to what I said\nBefore I think advertising you know well not everyone is going to like every single out that they see\nI think that overall in the health literacy conversation in the right direction\nOr you think about an illness um like like depression to be honest folks didn't talk about depression Twenty years ago\nUm that the advertising that occurred to raise awareness about antidepressant medications let a number of folks to start talking about the symptoms of depression or you think about uh you know all sorts of diseases where folks just didn't talk about it it it wasn't um you know it was perhaps the ...\nThere are a variety of reasons and maybe they weren't brought up um and so while you may not like a specific advertisement um overall for raising awareness about serious illnesses like depression HIV hepatitis um you know infectious diseases vaccines\nAre there are all sorts of reasons why we want people to seek medical\nCare if I if I may I really you you're not really taking credit for increased awareness around mental illnesses like depression but you're not you're not letting advertising from pharmaceutical companies take credit for that are you\nI wouldn't say well we certainly wouldn't take full credit but I Would say that talking about things are putting things on television I'm raising awareness of what symptoms for thing for diseases might be can certainly be helpful and moving the needle on illnesses that maybe weren't talked about or somebody may not have wanted to talk to their doctor\nIt well Dr Michael uber has standby here for just a second uh because I Want to bring in a couple of other voices\nInto this really interesting conversation joining us now also from Washington is Gail Wilensky she's an economist in senior fellow at the health foundation project hope she was the director of Medicare and Medicaid those programs during the administration of George H W. Bush\nAlso an adviser to John McCain's two thousand eight presidential campaign Gail Wilensky welcome to on point may be here with you it's great to have you and also with us joining us is David mitchell he's president and founder of patience for affordable drugs and national bipartisan\nNonprofit group that's focused on drug prices David mitchell welcome to you\nThank you for having me so ... you have an extended experience at the head of Medicare and Medicaid in America or I just wanted to kind of get to the bottom line question first with you do you think that list price transparency in pharmaceutical advertising will lead to or could lead to reduced\nThink having awareness of the list price is not inherently a bad thing that people will make their decisions about drugs\nBased on what it will cost them\nYou know what the drug costs is in general if anything you could imagine a perverse situation where people think oh that's a really expensive dropped it must be new and special and and very powerful\nMaybe I should check into that so I I think that if you're actually trying to influence the behavior\nAccording to what something costs the relevant information is between the physician and the patient at the time when a drug is being considered and then a relevant question for patients is what will it cost me if I take this drug or not their drug that's really what's relevant patients\nRight and and because of the way the American health care system a is right there are so many different answers to that question of what it could cost me and then\nI mean other than calling your insurer directly there's there's no ... what's the best way to find that out because there's so many different plans are so many different insurers it's not a simple answer\nIt isn't as simple answer but usually there's some pretty general guidelines so if you are on Medicare and have a what is called a um a supplementary policy they'll be general rules it's something that you want to speak to your physician about\nIt's important information because there is a lot of variability but it doesn't really help people to have information about what the list price is for a drug that they're probably never going to you know well did that just information that's not going to be helpful to\nDavid mitchell is it possible though that the shock value of senior high high numbers for ... certain drugs could I don't know produce public pressure or on the pharmaceutical companies to bring their ... their prices down\nWell first I agree with what's been set already used as a putting all this president has it's not going to lower the prices of prescription drugs in this country\nI also don't think that ah by forcing companies to put the list prices on that they will be shame and because the big drug companies in this country have shown that they're willing to be shamed all the way to the bank\nUm they continue\nInflation or health costs inflation these take a toll on patients like me I have an incurable blood cancer my drugs cost twenty four thousand dollars every time they get them to me\nA and their patients all across this country that are cutting pills and have ... doing without food dying because they can't afford their insulin a what we need to do is take steps to lower drug prices putting the list price\n[noise]\nSupport for on point comes from a guy called celebrating over Seventy five years of providing auto insurance for drivers across America more information on auto insurance available\nMaking the New England or rain jacket since Nineteen eighty three committed to designing apparel to prepare folks for whatever they have in store for the new fall collection is on view at Charles River apparel dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking today about a Trump Administration proposal to require drug companies to disclose the list prices for their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising and I'm joined today by Dr Michael you borrowed he's vice president of medical affairs at pharma\nThat's the trade and lobbying group of the American pharmaceutical industry is also an emergency room physician David mitchell joined us he's president and founder of patience for affordable drugs and gamble Lenski is with us as well she's an economist is senior fellow at the health foundation project hope and she's also a former director of Medicare and Medicaid she served in that position\nOr in the administration of President George W. Bush\nNo Gilliland ski I Want to ask you want to just get your view on what kind of an elephant in the room although David mitchell really just he he hit the nail on the head and the previous\nA segment and that is why isn't it that the the United States government or Medicare it has been given the power to negotiate on behalf of all the people who who rely on Medicare and\nAgain I Want to offer some some context you're on the differences that might make David had mentioned she Mira a as a very successful drug for it for its corporation Abby pharmaceutical than in twenty Fifteen\nFourteen billion dollars patients around the world spent fourteen billion dollars in one year on this one drug uh and then the United states\nFolks were paying the price I'm from ... prescription per month was about twenty seven hundred dollars that same drug costs Thirteen hundred dollars in the United kingdom and eight hundred dollars in Switzerland the only difference there being that we've got governments negotiate on and on behalf of patients and those other countries to why aren't we doing that here\nWanting need to stop using a word that you're using incorrectly as frequently done and that is government negotiating prices are governments don't negotiate a price when I ran Medicare I helped set through the Congress that's actually does that\nI set prices or they don't have any negotiations going on with the physician community in the hospitals it's taken a relief but here's what we're paying or you can purchase fate in Medicare or not or as you choose um if they're in\nIs what happens at in many other countries there's a lot has been concern that because of the very long\nPipeline between at the time a drug is first thought about and by the time it gets to market are estimated to be about ten years\nThat that very long pipeline\nMakes it quite different than other drugs or if he'll have government I set the price of a of a solution is too low you tend to know right away because you start having access problems to physicians and the concern has been that if the federal government has set some of the prices too low\nYou would not feel any of the effects in the pharmaceutical area for six to ten years because of this long lead time uh that it takes a there was\nOver they joined up and you're just a quick question about that so it is then are you saying that we need to just face the reality that the American patient the American consumer will forever have to be subsidizing the cost of this research well patients in other countries and enjoy the benefits at lower cost\nWe definitely do subsidize research for the rest of the world and we could stop that and it would have a disproportionately large effect because as long as we're willing to do it as a country other countries I get to benefit from that\nBut we can do things to make it a more competitive environment anytime there is a competing drug\nThat is coming along having the FDA do everything I can to expedite\nThe availability of that competing drug has been shown to really have an impact what we saw that for example with hepatitis C when there was one drug by gilly ad out of the price was extremely high\nWhen you had a second product come out by at the\nThe draw up the price of the drug dropped to a very comparable level to the u._k. now that is something we can control okay we can do the other it will have a disproportionate effect on the amount of research people have to decide if that's what they want a and that's what they're willing to live with\nMitchell would you like to respond to that I mean because I've heard this again and again from you know for people like you who are experts in this that the cost of reducing prices meaningfully in the United states would be perhaps not as many new drug\n[noise] um first of all I had an incurable blood cancer it's incurable because it mutates and finds its way around drugs I Will fail the drug regimen I'm On I'm already relapsed and then the second line of drugs so\nThe need for innovation and new drugs is not theoretical for me it's literally life and death but\nSecretary of health and Human Services and former head of a CEO of Louis in the U.S Alex days are said recently drug companies have tried to tell us we can't have innovation and affordable prices at the same time\nThat if we caught one penny of profits from the pharmaceutical industry that the innovation in America will grind to a halt\nI was a pharmacy EEO he said and I'm tired of those old talking points and the president is to\nAlex ... who worked at age age as maybe when Gail Wilensky was there um and ran a major drug company is telling us that this is a myth that we can't lower prices and still have innovation and new drug development and\nOne of the reasons is that increasingly it's taxpayers are paying we're paying for the new drug for that matter the research a budget of an age next year is going to be thirty nine billion dollars\nAnd they do the basic science there and increasingly they'd actually do drug development\nAnd then when the drug shows promise the drug companies swoop in and require the intellectual property and then president four hundred five hundred eight hundred thousand dollars a year so I Believe we can have both a and we need to return to balance from\nMaximizing profit for the drug companies to\nMaximizing the public health while maintaining fair returns for the drug companies and a robot star in the pipeline we can do that as a country\nMichael ... is that you I heard them yeah go ahead yeah well I wanted to just jump in because you know I think you have to recognize the amount of of investment that is being done by industry\nTo bring these new treatments market David Was right to an age budget as close to forty billion dollars are member companies and the pharmaceutical industry spent over Seventy billion dollars last year on research and development cc almost twice as much money spent on are indeed by the private sector by the by pharmaceutical industry to bring new treatments to market and the way I think about it is\nThen age is necessary but not sufficient and I and I can't say that the U.S has this really incredible rich ecosystem I'm from the standpoint of just\nSchools I'm from outside the u._s. they want to do their residency is they want to do research\nUh here and that's because of this rich ecosystem that we have to balance between the investment made by an age and then the tremendous investment it's made on behalf by the pharmaceutical industry\nAnd I think it's it's also important to note that our country incentivized was innovative therapies it it is a different um system in the U.S than in other countries we balance a balance that out by bringing\nA generic to market um a patent is so long at the end of the patent life I'm two or three new medicines come to market and the price drop sometimes as much as Ninety percent\nUm and you don't see that in other countries and other countries you see that they pay more for generics than we do here\nUm they they don't value new innovative therapies the same way that we do and one other interesting point that I'll just note as most other countries as a percentage of their budget spent about the same on medicines as we do so it's not that I'm not the just medicines are more expensive than the U.S [noise]\nUm but you actually see the health care in general is more expensive and so I think if you focus on medicines exclusively you miss the bigger picture and you miss the fact that there are tremendous numbers of inefficiencies in the U.S health care system that we could do a better job of a you know we could address and we could lower overall cost a little costs\nLikely but a couple of things are just so you you said that uh\nThat uh once drugs come off patent generics pop up and costs drop by Ninety percent but it is true though that that that a lot of pharmaceutical companies do what they can they're not always successful but they do what they can to extend those patents I mean we've seen that over and over again with with different kinds of drugs that we have to at least acknowledge that\nNinety percent of medicines dispense in this country or generic we have one of the highest generic utilization rates of any country in the world nine out of ten prescription", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "18"}
