[noise]\n[noise]\nFrom WVU are Boston and NPR magna Chuck liberty and this is on point\nAlmost half of democratic ads\nRun this far in the mid term elections have focused on one thing healthcare\nIt is one of the defining issue if not uniquely defining one on the campaign trail right now up to one hundred thirty million Americans may have some kind of pre existing condition one of the reasons why the geo peas push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act has put Republican candidates in the position of trying to convince voters\nThat they're protecting born of Obamacare's most popular provisions\nWell also trying to end a lot of voters are very passionate about this issue but how much of that passion will translate at the ballot box this hour on point healthcare and the midterms and we want to hear from you is health care the issue that will define or at least influence\nHow you vote what have you been hearing from candidates in congressional races in your district\nAbout the

radio has been covering the very interesting race a Senate race in Missouri\nJamon is welcome to appoint\nHigh magnet thanks for having me it's great to have you know of course the Senate race is between democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill and a Republican candidate Missouri attorney general Josh Hawley so how much is health care defining or how the two are engaging with each other or asking for people for their vote\nWell on on her side I Would say it's probably eighty five percent a I mean it's a major major focus of McCaskill most of the ads that she is paying for our about health care or she has been she conducted over fifty town hall\nTo she actually started focusing on it before many other Democrats elsewhere in the country did I covered her first one about Eighteen months ago\nAnd that's when some of the started now was a health care was the big issue for her or for voters engaging with her the town or voters engaging with her and what were the very first one in April twenty Seventeen and it was brought up then and by the time I caught up with her at another one I'm a year ago in October twenty Seventeen\nThat was a major major focus of most of the people in the audience and these were open town hall these were just open to anybody not not particularly partisan and what were people saying to her\nWell they were concerned ah because at that time if you recall twenty Seventeen or that's one of the law the votes for taking\nA in Washington about doing away with the Affordable CARE Act and while people have had issues with it ah people many of the public or we're getting concerned because a either they were getting their um health care on the exchange or they were concerned about how it was kind of fact\nUh the coverage that they had\nOne of the problems

D D L E y travel doctor [noise]\n\nSaddam point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about health care in the mid term elections and how much people's attitudes in hopes for the American health care system may influence their vote\nA in these midterm races were speaking today with Jonathan Cohn ... national senior national correspondent at huff post covering healthcare social welfare politics man is also joined us Joe is political reporter for\nSt Louis public radio uh and I want to play a little bit of tape for both of you here in terms of how this health care issue is playing out in Arizona I'm obviously a very interesting Senate race going on out there between democratic congresswoman\nChristian cinema and Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally their vote both are running for Senate in Arizona and this is a moment from last week's Senate debate in Phoenix\nThe reality is that Aaron signs are worried about losing access to this critical coverage and Martha has voted to take that protection away\nTo that if there's a flat out lie again either just classic scare tactics that they turn on a TV all over the country right now the Democrats have nothing to run on and so they're choosing\nThere was democratic congresswoman a Christian cinema and the second voice was Republican congressman Murtha mix Sally\nJonathan Cohn ... how is it possible that Mars and makes Sally is thing that she voted to protect people with preexisting conditions when she like many many other Republicans\nVoted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act this is the block that I think a lot of a Congress people are finding themselves Republican Congress people who find themselves in how are they trying to get out of that box\nSo the simple answer is that she's not telling the truth\nUm she's trying to whitewash a record and tell her tell voters she voted differently than she actually did the long answer is that the Affordable CARE Act the way it protects preexisting conditions I mean you can do with a bunch of different ways\nYou could for example set up a government health care plan and Justin role everybody um but if you want to work with private health insurance and you have to regulate the plant and it's hard because insurance companies have gotten very good\nUh they need to to survive financially they've gotten very good at figuring how not to cover bills from sick people and how not to take sick people on\nSo you have to tell the insurance companies that they have they can't deny coverage to somebody who has a preexisting condition but you also have to tell them that they can't charge more to people\nWho have pre existing conditions and you also have to tell them that they have to cover a full range of benefits they can't leave out the benefits that would make insurance useless to people with certain conditions and do you have to tell them that by the way if someone if you accept someone even if they have a pre existing condition you actually have to cover that pre existing condition\nSo the problem with what Republicans have done when confronted with this when they started to repeal the Affordable CARE Act last year and suddenly they realized that wait a minute people care about not be happy with everything about the Affordable CARE Act a lot of people are angry about it but they liked that protection for pre existing conditions\nSo they put in a line and there are in their bill that said okay we're going to protect people with preexisting conditions and we're going to stop or insurance companies from denying coverage outright well that's fine but they left the door open to other mechanisms and so did other ... pretty much every effort you've seen\nBy Republicans whether it's to house repeal bill that mix Sally voted for whether it's the plan that Josh Hawley\nFloats in an op ed in St Louis what they all have in common is that they pick and choose one or two of these mechanisms but they leave the other loopholes open and I can promise you because it's happened before that when insurance companies see those loopholes\nThey will go they will see it on them and they will drive right through them and you basically have a system where at least in some states and for some people\nGet the coverage than you do man is ah I'm really interested to hear what you've heard from voters because\nI think it's easy to um rally around in popular provisions in the Affordable CARE Act like preexisting conditions as as we've been talking about\nBut health care and this this country is so complicated that even when someone you knew who says well versed in as Jonathan Cohn\nTries to explain or goes about explaining the you know the secondary and tertiary level issues that come with any of the proposals that we've heard over the past many years I mean it is it is the debate on the campaign trail getting to to that level um that you're hearing in Missouri and if it does\nUm how are voters responding to that\nWell let me give you just a couple of quick examples I covered a lot of events rallies and so forth for Holly and McCaskill [noise] um I was at two in the last couple of weeks for Holly\nOkay at one in a very prominent um St Louis county suburb of one of the top Republican officials who I talked to before Holly began speaking was telling me about their child or had health issues they were concerned about the pre existing conditions\nAnd he collars Holly and asked them about it\nAnd says you know are you going to be able to do this we've got this lawsuit I mean this was and I'm just standing there listening to this\nAnd Holly's giving the answer that I told your thing and there's other ways to do it doesn't have to be the formal CARE Act this official seemed otherwise placate it he supported Holly on other issues\nFast forward a week later I met another event another part of the county big Republican rally now these are all Republican loyalists\nSome woman and that is whispering to him after after he gave his speech and I went over and asked her what she asked him about what she's really big with him on several issues\nBut she was really concerned about preexisting conditions and she just wanted to know how he was going to do this now that intrigued me because you usually don't run across that especially at\nPart of an event where this issue is just like on everybody's mind\nWhat will so did she then uh when she heard would've ... attorney general Holyhead they did she did she have confidence in his answer she believe him\nYes okay so to Jonathan code that's this this is a perfect example because I I Want to know against because of the complications of health care um it is it possible that no matter how hard Democrat hammer away at this\nThat when a those themes ... candidates are saying well but there are alternative plans that can take care of all your concern is that convincing enough to voters\nWell you know we'll we'll see in November I'm I think it's a real concern the reality is as you said um as as President Trump said healthcare is very complicated it's easy to throw all this information out there and confused people I Do think Democrats have one very important thing going for them which is\nPeople get lost in the weeds and you know they'll get confused and you know politicians say X or y but\nHealthcare is one of those issues where I think instinctively\nYou asked your average voter which party it probably ah is going to do more to protect your health care which like cares more about healthcare instinctively people associate that with the Democrats\nNow they made you know they may not like Obamacare they may be other thing about them and they think Democrats raised taxes too much or you know too much regulation but you know in a fundamental level which is the party that tends to defend Medicare which is the party that has all you know has had presidents going back to Harry Truman\nFighting to help people get healthcare which you know whose name is on this law that for whatever its flaws you know people wanna keep and that's Obama Care so I think instinctively the default here is to favor Democrats if he gets confusing and this it all\nWe have a we even have a Fox News poll recent Fox News full from just the within the last week I think that found that forty nine percent of Americans believe that Democrats would do a better job on health care compared to thirty four percent who say Republicans would\nThat's absolutely right and historically that's been the trend you know if you look at the long term trends are Democrats you usually have an advantage on healthcare adept and you know there and if you look at when it did you know it did have to be Affordable Care act became ... after the implementation um but it's basically return to its normal level and I think\nDemocrats can draw on that reservoir of trust on the issue of health care and use that and I think that's why you see Republicans as desperate as they are and why you see\nJosh Holly and Martin ... and all these other Republicans you know trying to sort of pretend that they voted for something that they did in ... you know and and using a other ways to try to get out of this because it's a big vulnerability\nBut I still wonder that when it comes to that moment of uh actually casting a vote filling in that bubble pulling the lever what have you how much health care will be on the minds of voters at that moment because you know the GOP is running on so many other issues that matter to a lot of voters we're hearing so much talk with a lot of talk about immigration and about jobs et cetera so\nLet's sort of our callers simply wouldn't get an answer to some of those questions were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five\nYes um I think there is a huge called KM bluff going on by all the Republican candidates for Congress including our congressmen in Maryland who's a physician doctor round the Harris there are massive loopholes in the\n\nSupport for on point comes from listeners or W.

talking about health care in the mid term elections and how much this one issue\nMaybe on voters' minds as they cast their ballots are in two thousand Eighteen I'm joined today by Joe ... political reporter for St Louis public radio Jonathan Cohn is also with us senior national correspondent at huff post covering the healthcare\nSocial welfare and politics and let's go to the bones here because the lens\nIs on the line he's calling from Antioch, Illinois land you're on the air\nHello yeah I've been self employed for ah twenty eight years since Nineteen Ninety five and dealing with this whole healthcare thing for many many years and uh I actually had Blue Cross Blue Shield here in Illinois good insurance and I was able to pay as little as two hundred dollars ten years ago\nFor all for myself my wife and my daughter and then when Obama Care came into effect\nI could no longer buy that health insurance at all and if I Want to even get a policy even close to it it's ten times that amount\nSo to say that the Democrats have gotten a better job on health care for the self employed not so not so I Can't afford it I think you know you know a share ministry of interior ministry a type of a contract live under Obamacare\nYeah Tennessee a quick question that's a you eligible for any of the subsidies are that the Affordable CARE Act okay you're not\nSo I'm kind of you know no cause people who are in what you call the middle class self employed people they don't make enough to\nGet the really fancy healthcare but they're stuck in the middle there there are they still make too much to get any of the subsidy so I don't make too much to get any any type of welfare or anything else but I don't make enough to uh pay two thousand dollars a month for health care\nYeah Lance thank you for your call Jonathan Cohn ah this I think it's this is absolutely the other side of the major health care or challenges that we have in the United states it the people like labs are right that\nThat we still have the problem the spiraling cost and that the AC didn't cover everyone who needs assistance with health care and so he wants to go back to the days where I actually I should probably should've asked him I'm not sure what he thinks about pre existing condition but he wants to go back to a time where he can actually afford the premiums for certain kinds of plans\nYeah I mean this is the single biggest a failing problem shortcoming of the Affordable CARE Act um you know if you go but you know the the\nThe people who had insurance were not aware of these gaps\nUntil they got sick but you know the prescription coverage might be partial there whereas in your lifetime limit on policies on benefits that sort of thing um if you didn't get really sick you didn't notice if you did get really sick he got stuck with some really big bill say for Bill Carrick comes and says we're going to change all that insurance has to be available to everybody it has to cover\nYou know all the things that employer policy would cover and that made it more expensive so that they added these tax credits to help people afford it well what happened was in a ... ... people who are poor or lower middle class into the middle class\nIt's worked out quite well for the most part um ads income goes up though you get less financial assistance people are exposed to the full cost of these plans and ah your caller just now it sounds like one of those people who is now facing just on affordable health insurance\nAnd is looking for alternative so\nThe question is how you deal with that do go backwards to the way it was you just take away or do you say All right we need to give those people like your caller the same kind of access to coverage that people who are lower income have do you give them more subsidies to just create a you open up Medicare and Medicaid to them these uh you know that is the fundamental debate or going forward\nBut isn't the debate because I'm not actually sure I hear that conversation only here is should repeal replace or or preserve it will be having a substantive debate in Washington or maybe even any of these congressional races about alternatives next steps\nWell we're not having the context of this election because Republicans have power and and and for them it's a simple choice either keep what we have or go back to the way it was however you do hear on the Democratic side\nUh lots of talk about you know all the people were thinking about running for president they were all talking about everything from Medicaid by and medical I mean this candidate up in Michigan a there's a list is like and I was talking about has said I favor letting people buy into Medicare if they can't\nAfford health insurance and of course there's Bernie Sanders and many other Democrats to say hey we need a single payer system so on the Democratic side this is a very active conversation\nThat really breaking through the noise right now but I promise you that if Republicans or lose at least one house of Congress to repeal really comes off the table finally this is the conversation we're going to have leading into twenty twenty presidential\nElection well since we were talking about a premiums and the and the aspect of the healthcare system that the ... act did not solve that cost issue came up at a Senate debate in Miami in Florida earlier this month and Florida Republican governor Rick Scott really railed against Democrats\nPremiums your cost per family is going to go down twenty five hundred dollars then almost double stockpiles Rob copayments rough they send you wouldn't lose your doctor now we know that was an ally of the century you want to lose your plan and we know that was a complete lie so if you look at the end for health care act what they said it was going to do didn't do it\nWe have got to make sure we take care of people with preexisting condition\nOkay so that Florida Republican governor Rick Scott now in in that same debate incumbent democratic Senator Bill Nelson really called out Scott for saying that he supports pre existing conditions\nI just heard the governor say that he favors the insurance for pre existing conditions exactly the opposite of what he has allowed the state of Florida to file suit to declare unconstitutional\nPre existing conditions protection that is in the law that is unconscionable\nThat's from an early October debate for the Florida Senate race let me just turn quickly now if I Can't do Reid Epstein is national political reporter for the wall Street Journal a and he's been traveling in various places across the country\nListening to what's going on in these congressional races and he joins us today from Washington read welcome to on point I make them so I you know to Jonathan and Joe have been telling us a lot about what they're seeing and races that they've followed ... ... is a pattern that they laid out something that you've been witnessing on the campaign trail is well\nWell the thing to remember is that like for Democrats running\nIn races all over the country up and down the ticket healthcare is not just the the most important issue they're talking about for a lot of them it's really the only issue they're talking about the uh I was just a Nevada this weekend a writing about the Senate race there and Jacky Rosen a Democrat who's running is really pushed\nHealth care and and the preexisting condition argument front and center on her campaign uh the the democratic superPAC that's backing her I a hundred percent of their ads on Facebook are attacking the Republican on preexisting conditions in health care and it's it's an issue that Democrats\nClearly think who's worked for them and as we've seen by the way that Republicans have\nHandled the preexisting condition question are so many of them are now vowing to protect\nA the preexisting ... ... ... previously protection preexisting condition protections that they have voted on some cases dozens of times to strip or that it's really a potent argument that both parties see as something that they need to be behind at this point\nTo read Jonathan and Joe let's just talk for a second about hum\n... plans um that was introduced in late August some ten senators and the similar plant came up in the house called the\nI named the insurance coverage for patients with preexisting conditions or act and it actually borrows words directly from the Affordable CARE Act if I have this right saying that ensures quote may not establish rules for eligibility based on\nHealth status medical conditions claims experience or medical history but\nJonathan Cohn I mean is that the exactly the same thing as the pre existing coverage that's currently under the Affordable CARE Act\nNo and it's the same phenomenon we've seen before where it has some of the pieces of the Affordable CARE Act but it leaves out others it leaves out the essential benefits\nA requirement for example which is a requirement that you have to cover things like mental health and that you have to have full prescription coverage and again insurance companies have gotten very good at manipulating those levers in ways that can make insurance either unattractive or unusable to people who have serious medical conditions\nAnd don't forget that you know a ... you know we talk about ... conditions as if it's just these requirements on insurance companies but it's also the financial assistance that lets people by the insurance\nIs also the expansion of Medicaid which covers millions of people many of whom have\nPre existing conditions and the repeal plans that Republicans have voted for all undermined weekend eliminate both that or or or alter that funding for the subsidies and for the Medicaid expansion\nAnd so if you're just you know having this this this this Republican bill which by the way you know who knows if they could even pass it out of Congress it'll at least that proposal I mean you know it's the idea that this would actually uh give people the same level the same kind of protection they have now is frankly just preposterous", "show_name": "On
