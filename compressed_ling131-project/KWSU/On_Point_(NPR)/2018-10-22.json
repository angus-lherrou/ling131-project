security for political ... also joined us he's co director of Harvard bell for center and director of the defending digital democracy project\nAnd we've got a lot of comments coming in on line here are some of them apparently of a theme he's from Facebook and Twitter are Andrew Cash a can Eliot\nAnd let's see who else Hello Kitty and zero five eight and zero all basically say really question

that our there it was terrific it is an issue we have talked about and will continue to do so in the future but this hour we thought it was actually important to also\nTake a look at election security and voting security at the state and local level and you know in our defense I'm going to say we're not the only ones who were worried about this because here is a clip of Senator Marco Rubio at a Senate intelligence committee back in March\nLaying out what he thinks could be a hypothetical hacking he's give me an example of how it can be done on local election system\nThey penetrate the voter database of local election officials and strategically located counties or states\nAnd then they use analytic information that may have gotten from who knows where and they use that information to go into the database and they changed the addresses of individuals there by their precincts move around maybe they even delete some people from the rolls\nAnd the result is that on election day we started getting reports about thousands of voters in different parts of the country who can't vote because when they show up\nThey're not registered they're not in the system or they show up and they're told that they're voting places halfway across town somewhere else\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio there in San ... says Senate intelligence committee in March\nTim stark let me just turn to you quickly because you've reported on um lots of specific examples of challenges that we have nationwide with our current voting system for example can you tell me that story briefly of the election systems and software machine\nOr the model six fifty populating machine and I should note that election systems in software\nIt's one of the country's largest vendors of voting equipment um what's the problem with the model six fifty tabulate machine\nI've actually brought that up a little bit already but all our lab right because there are some other details about yeah interesting why it's so it's a bow tie billing machine that could be used at the at the county level to ah if it were ... were hacked and somebody could it could alter hundreds and hundreds of votes perhaps thousands\nThat's part one another part is that it must be a ... it was the one that was it will be broken up with a with a reading pen\nAnd third um it it had a vulnerability that that these researchers found that was actually a decade old\nWhich goes to show how far behind some of these companies are on cyber security or the voting centers of taken a lot of criticism yes and that's just one of them for kind of sticking their head in the hands on this I'm not realizing that this is a problem and wanting it to kind of go way um other other\nChinese a playlist music playlist on one of these machines for no apparent reason um it makes you wonder about the supply chain which is the ... who's\nWho is getting into these machines and where who was fixing them who's working on them and and and suggest that that these things are perhaps more ... than we even realize a Chinese music playlist yes\nIt was it was like MP threes if you remember it was it was a it was an older machine that they that is that they found this on it also found some examples of people um I I it's sending out or or being ... are receiving messages in a way that suggested that um it it also could have been tampered with and that way although they had no conclusive evidence\nI still have we have never what have we ever found any malware known malware on or any other kind of a virus that that shows evidence of hacking on these machines are no because we haven't done those forensic artist that you're talking about\nI I I think it's the latter I've not personally heard of a of any now we're being someone else but but keep in mind of course that now are spent on basically everything these days yeah there's a strong chance that it's that has happened and I'm just not aware of it in a few people are\nWell Eric Rosen buck at Kim points out that some states use these this particular machine the model six fifty to process the ballots for entire counties and you can imagine and closely fought states in this country it only takes one county\nTo flip the electoral college but he he he he quotes Jake Bronner University of Chicago professor who served as a White House liaison or to de ... saying the biggest flaw in the process that he's found even when they identify flies is that they don't get sick\nSo it's not a problem with the vendors or with the state and county level officials who are using these machines\nUm [noise] there's a really important point so to begin with this is not a hypothetical type of attack in Ukraine and twenty fourteen the Russian intelligence services attacked the vote tabulation machine in Ukraine decided to sort of try to suppress\nThat election you could see them easily using that same playbook in the U.S [noise]\nI'm a question of whether it's on the states or the vendors my personal belief is it's much more on the vendors they keep their software clothes and proprietary\nBased on their bottom line interest of trying to make money and were they more transparent and open it would be much easier for researchers just like they do in other areas of cyber security\nTo find vulnerabilities um someone big ideas as a nation we could move and should move to an open source type system for all of our voting software\nSystem here because to the level to which some of these uh these\nUh as Tim stark says is reported after DEF CON the or the hacker conference that a ES and asked election systems in software actually I Believe scent of a letter to its own customers warning them against helping researchers are by providing them with voting machine software\nA centrally saying that um you know it's proprietary we have copyright rules on it don't even help researchers are trying to make our our election system more secure\nYeah it's it's really disturbing for example anytime I say something negative about the vendors I'll get calls from their lobbying organizations asking if I really understand what I'm Talking about or whether I don't want to talk to them so that I can give a more balanced article nation\nIt reminds me a little bit of back in the older days when the the music industry was so adamantly protecting things in a way that didn't allow\nNew technology to emerge um so I think there's a problem are now states or in a position where they unfortunately are under resourced I'm so don't always have a lot of money to update the systems or keep their security up to date and do pattern\nSo there is an issue there that we need to address uh but I Do think this was more on the ... not being as transparent as they should\nAll right well Tim and Eric hang on here for just a second 'cause there's one more person I Want to welcome into this conversation Mary Schneider joined us She's president of verified voting a national election integrity advocacy group she's former Pennsylvania deputy deputy secretary for elections and administration posts she served in\nFrom two thousand Fifteen to two thousand Seventeen Mary Schneider welcome to um point Oh thank you\nUh first of all let's just let's get your take on this um E. S. S. example again election an election systems in software this major vendor of voting machines and in this country because they have issued a statement saying that this report about the hack ability of their machines\nUm ... their statement says that the vote the report can validate that any type of technology can be exploited under conditions where it is made accessible with Iraq controls which is not the case in an election\nRegarding the M six fifty ESN as first manufactured it um in Nineteen Ninety nine and discontinued manufacture those units in early two thousand eight so major vendor they're saying there isn't a problem ... what's your response to that\nWell first of all of that I just want to point out the ... six fifty is is a high speed central count scanner that has not used at polling places\nBut I I think that I'll agree with their premise that all the computers are\nThe computers need special handling and in order to manage the risk that counting votes by computers present and so we can never get the risk down to zero\nWhich is why we need to give a lecture and officials the tools they need to demonstrate that the software reported the results accurately and that's why we were talking earlier about paper ballots an audits those specifically if you look at this takes that day that's a that's an optical scanner so that's a paper ballot\n[noise]\nAnd they changed their goal in high school\nComplete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship award more in college ... dot com and exact science is offering coma guard\nFor average risk and don't over a noninvasive colon cancer screening tests can be used at home by prescription only information that Colin ... dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making talking about we're talking about election integrity at the state and local level about how to be sure the vote you actually cast a ballot you cast is as secure\nAs possible and I'm speaking this hour has Tim's Stark's he covers cyber security for political Eric Rosen Bach also joined us he's co director of Harvard spell for center and director of the defending digital democracy project Marion Schneider is with us as well she's president of verified voting national ... election integrity\nAdvocacy group and let's go to the phone lines here and it looks like a we've got a call from Jim Condos from Burlington, Vermont and Jim Condos that sounds like the name of the Vermont secretary of state is that a dean who you are\nThat is indeed who I Am\nWell Secretary condos welcome to the program thank you so much for calling in or how is that the state of election security in Vermont\nSo we say we feel that we're pretty good shape we uh we actually started working on cyber security in our election systems back in two thousand Thirteen or ... at that time we did a full blown\nRisk and vulnerability assess but um we had any recommendations or a a potent you eat in a low priority or an animal we've consistently work to get all those recommendations a place are being said that we also\nA penetration passed and we continue to do a a regular other patient tests as well uh and\nI think that that the the important thing to remember most\nOf most of your listeners is that uh and it's been mentioned already what are we are a very this decentralized system from aren't on like Boston New England we do not have county government leaving town level to the state level or in\nAnd you know we've got a lot of things going on and I you know I sat on a panel with Eric Wilson bomb a it back in March or before the Senate intelligence committee or you know we announce at that time that we are implementing\nIt's actually kind of let me just jump in here your cell phones on a little bit shaky here but at this point to the key question when I ask you before hopefully your luck out fully like will fall apart but\nI was seeing here that even given the steps that you you said you just take in Vermont to ensure the security of the voting system there as much as possible\nI mean NBC News is rupe reports that in August in late August there were three different methods used to uh get access or attempt to get access to Vermont online voter registration database someone tried three times or three different people groups tried to get access to your your voter database did that happen\nYes it did in Libya but let me explain that there isn't a computer in the oil that has a website or anything that isn't getting ... and every day what we experienced was scans our lives\nAre are like a large sum up systems are showed us\nWhere they were coming originating from although the ... you can always count on that but the one that raised our attention if you want to call it um was the one that said Russian Federation only forward is out on to\nA department of homeland security through the communication for the call that we have a developed over the last a year\nAnd a I think that that you know our systems are getting paid and thousands of times per day thousands times per hour the question is how to cook the systems in place to defend against it back in two thousand six being there were Twenty one states that were\nTargeted yep one state was breached and all those good conversation as always got a one state that was released would never about eight or twenty states that are actually a defended again\nWe favors worry you know I haven't I haven't heard of that which they went to was breached Honda is\nA it was I Believe it was I Believe it was a um Illinois\nOkay interesting well one last question for you briefly because they want to come back to I guess with the with what you have to say but but I mean you're the state for Vermont what would be the most helpful thing to you from the federal level to take even more strides forward in elections like you're already\nWell now let me let me speak for myself and I I must say that uh\nWhen I leave is that there are some practices that we need to put in place one of them a little older marked paper ballots 'cause that was really the only way that you can actually audit or we do what we call we do a hide statistical consequences\n[noise] doing them grow up in\nYeah [noise] well Jim Condos secretary of state for Vermont calling us from Burlington, Vermont thank you so much for your call Mary Schneider let me turn back to your president or verified voting there are what are you hearing what the secretary of state of Vermont had to say\nWell I think that all of the things that he mentioned are really important especially the voter my paper ballots which we were talking about and and I wanted to turn back to something that I said earlier in the show the kind of audits that we're talking about are not a forensic analysis of machines or\nAnything like that there is a statistical sample of these ballot of the voter my paper ballot so that you can check and make sure the software um was a recorded the results accurately but what he said about um doing the risk of vulnerability assessment\nUm when I was in Pennsylvania we we actually engage with the age has to do a risk and vulnerability assessment of the Internet you know Internet facing applications networks that touched on elections within Pennsylvania\nAnd we actually also contract it was a third party vendor to do the same thing\nAnd I think that that those are steps that every state should take what the other complexity is that sometimes\nThe elections are run under the governor's jurisdiction sometimes are running a very small secretary of State Department so the level of resources is going to vary widely I think we keep coming back to this resource question\nWell let's take another call here Kathleen is calling\nFrom Syracuse New York Kathleen you're on the air\nI make now I Am an election inspector in Onondaga County which is in upstate New York ... I live in Syracuse ... and I've been doing that since two thousand\nSeveral years ago we switch to a new voting system instead of using the ... machine we switch to voter mark ballot\nCombined with optical scanners so when we get to the polling place in the morning\nWe had locked suitcases for each district we have a\nStickers that keep the voting machine from in messed with unless somebody uses a pair of scissors and takes them off and we we are told by a board of elections I notice a audits sheets how many ballots they have centralized they come shrink wrapped in\nKind of convoluted\nVery mathematical system where you have to account for every single ballot we also have affidavit ballots to people that aren't showing up in our um our in our elections ducks so that if somebody comes in and we can't find their name they had the opportunity to fill the affidavit ballot and\nHave a chance to vote when they voted against gun marking the ballot fat little circles in them for each candidate and him and that yeah they take the paper ballot they get in line and then they go to the optical scanning machine and they scan it through at the end of the night\nWe had people who break down the voting machine they a scanner and we have to\nMemory cards inside of the scanner one of the memory cards were able to pop out and we physically hand to a runner who physically takes it down to the board of elections I see so that they can do a quick audits that official unofficial southern get it on ... think of that\nAnd then um there's also a second memory chip in the same machine\nYeah we'll get a ticket I'm going to take the call back from you on that point and thank you so much because you feel a lot of interesting things that I Want to hear from our guests reflect on so Kathleen election inspector from Syracuse New York Thank you for your call\nA ... um I think they're probably several other steps that tell me more to talk to us about about how New York tries to make their elections as secure as possible does it sound like they're doing living the right thing\nIt sounds like they're doing a really good job so Kathleen is one of those state and local election officials that really earned are respect when we have this national level tabletop exercise here in Cambridge, Massachusetts several months ago", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "22"}
