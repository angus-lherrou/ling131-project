sociology political science at Stanford University sounding co editor of the journal of democracy and all throughout the spirit of democracy\nAnd Larry before we leave the question of Brazil a behind and in talking about the other nations actually want to get a call in here because we have a Brazilian voter Michael is calling from Boston, Massachusetts Michael you're on the air\nBridge a so Michael you there yes Hi go ahead\nMy uh America I\nLived here in the U.S forever I'm a U.S Senate voted for both of them out of this uh last\nSunday along with a bunch of other presidents that some of them are legal that suffer under quote unquote trumps the way we both so NATO is not the way we see Trump or we see both for NATO\nDamp against corruption the weight Brazil has been governed in the last ... years um it's just it's just not to stay up all the government machine there at a map of corruption goes beyond the higher echelons of government spread out throughout\nSociety and unfortunately uh there were only two candidates that made it to the run up so you had to pick between [noise]\nTrip that I saw him as a a you know as a venue for or you know as a vehicle for ah [noise] to lead the space\nStation in Michael ... I just wanted to echo your point here is reading a you know for example I'm a code in a in the Washington Post from a polo dentist saying if there had been another decent Kennedy he wouldn't have voted for a full scenario that both knows a lot of garbage but he's the lesser of the evil thing exactly what you said there Michael\nBut I've got another comment here from a different listener Michael Gaskins says on Facebook to us why do people feel that they must give a green light to racism sexism homophobia an anti environmental isn't in order to fight crime and corruption both ... brings all of the above just say nothing of its fondness for state sponsored murder\nWhat's your response to this other listener Michael\nI come from an African Brazilian descent so you know from black the grandparents I have gay friends that voted for both of them out of the uh feminism a\nQuote unquote you know argument against us without you know there are so many I was just so many things he I asked that in the past for example when you're you mentioned that lady that he talked about that particular period I he was arguing against shoes defending the Chandler that'd be headed in rape the girl\nWas livid against that situation so he was he was he was so limited\nThat a woman was not sending another fellow woman that was raped and be headed that level of conversation that he had to go against up in Brazil yeah you're looking at people that I go to jail they go to jail\nOr things that will get capital punishment here in the U.S they'll go to jail they'll surf I don't know three four years and then they'll leave right just as a young that's young lady that killed their parents uh she was able to to get out of jail for a for a Mother's Day walk\nMichael thank you for your call your passion there and I want to hear Larry diamonds response to that uh Larry diving Michael very clearly saying that the problem in Brazil so overwhelming that both the more just to stay useful parts that he may not approve of him both in our early fall by the wayside\nWell I think it's great to Michael Cole dune because we now have a direct expression\nOf the frustration and anger that produce the victory for the extreme right and I said surely exclusively ups or attorney in Canada and the problem is that when you\nSuch a blunt and Savage instrument as someone who has been so explicitly authoritarian and has expressed over\nThe entire quarter century trajectory of his political career such frequent contempt for democracy you're putting the whole democratic system you know on the operating table\nAnd we need to keep something in mind magna uh when we look at what's going on in the world now but also\nThe history of democratic failure in the world frequently when you put in office and failing or miss performing democratic system someone who has been abundantly clear about his authoritarian intentions he acts on them\nAnd I'd say Brazilian democracy is that the beer risk right now\nI'm going to play a little tape that may or support exactly the point that you're saying uh Larry Diamond this takes us to the Philippines with President Rodrigo ... their\n... who was it has been very outspoken about his crackdown on drugs and violence there\nOr to the point where you know he advocates extrajudicial killings in the Philippines and in twenty sixteen he actually compared himself favorably to Adolf Hitler saying that he would like to kill millions of drug dealers ...\nBoss or the millions [noise] ... ... it's the meal\nWas imminent but I [noise] I'd be happy to look\nAt Philippine president Rodrigo de ... saying Hitler massacred three million Jews now there is three million drug dealers I'd be happy to slaughter them a butler diamond I said we've got some comments coming here from listeners I'm wonder you know you said that democracy may be on the ... end up on the operating table\nIn these countries but Sean Miguelina says I think more than a little tongue in cheek he said I'm outraged that citizens of the foreign country can vote their free will and someone calling themselves ... said is it really a pushback\nOn democracy if the strong man in question if democratically elected in a legitimate election what do you think but\nI'd say a few things I'm number one uh\nDeterred to actually has presided over the extrajudicial\nOf well over twelve thousand people are on the streets with the Philippines so\nSecondly although there is rising despair and cynicism about democracy and Brazil\nThere is not a majority sentiment to end democracy and Brazil and that is certainly not what Brazilian voters want I don't think it is what our previous caller Michael wanted they just want decisive action\nTo reform and cleanse the system so you can say yes they voted for change they certainly did\nThey voted for what they perceived to be\nIn the runoff election the only option for real change that they hide but that doesn't give both in our license to close down the Congress to close down the Supreme Court as his son who is also a congressman suggested they might have to do or to violate civil liberties\nAnd I think Brazilians now need to be very organized and very vigilant uh as we should be a from the international community and ensuring that both in our address is Brazil's problems in a way that don't violate the constitution and the rule of law\nYeah well Larry Diamond let me just bring in another voice into the conversation Laura king joins us today from Washington She's global affairs correspondent for the Los Angeles times Laura king welcome to on point\nHi Nick it's great to have you learned to let me just ask you I mean you you've heard Larry or talk about what he sees and some of the threats to to to democracy long term threats and democracy with the\nRise of the ... leaders around the world\nUh I'm just wondering if you see any sort of you or what are the unifying features that you see in what brought them to power I mean I at this situation on the ground in each of these countries are slightly different but it seems to be that to me that one of the things that defines all of these leaders and I would include Donald Trump among them\nIs this call this strong call to an us versus them\nA political language that that is has resonated in each of these countries do you\nIt I I think yes I certainly think that's true and I think I think you see an\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from W.

forty three talk lots of people uh want to join us Larry and Laura let me just get some callers in here Alice is calling from Norwalk, Connecticut Alice you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call 'em it's been reported that Steve Bannon was an advisor to both an arrow in his bid for the presidency and as you know he was chief strategist for Donald Trump in his twenties sixteen presidential election\nI'm a kind of appalled by the fact that Trump utilized him a given the fact that\nBannon is as he says a populist but in my opinion is is actually a white nationalist and I'm Wondering what your guest thought about his influence on in this election um it's disturbing to me that he also supported Marine Le pen um and\n... you know her bid for for a her election in France\nWill let me just let me let the since you asked a good question let me let our panelists respond thank you for your call a lawyer a king us Steve Bannon is uh still working to spread populism throughout the world what influence or ruled as you have to play if any in Brazil well\nIn terms of Brazil I'm not I'm not I'm not so well versed in that but I Would I Would say that one thing that's been interesting about Mr Bannon is that he's he's encountered some some rejection and some resistance from even some of the European national is with\nWith whom he seeking to make an alliance um some of them are infected telling him to to stay out of it and and uh and that does kind of reflect their their sense of of\nOf at a homegrown homegrown um tradition but didn't they arrested and\nDidn't they just read though that a ... a Italy's deputy prime minister I'm actually joined a band and his organization called the movement that he founded to spread populous politics in basically undermine the European Union the veggie happened recently right\nWell Mr Bannon I think has has thought actively to to export his what he did for Mr Trump to to Europe and that has that has pretty much been a driving force behind what he's been doing since the since he left the White House I see\nSo let's go to Jill who's calling from St ...\nI guess one to say that a strong arm tactics\nAnd they work in the short term however they're not a novel over a long time you may get a few quick when uh the only way to move forward and not end up and down night is to actually at the time in Illinois relationship with the people you need to work with\nOn even if you look at them and then you're doing a process redesign you need to get by in an all members of the team and if you don't own any is skip that work of relationship building you're always going to have people working undermine progress\nEven at the progress benefit everyone\nJill thank you for your call Larry Diamond um do do people do politicians have the time though to ... to build those those relationships to garner that consensus that Joe is talking about its requisite first successful democracy\nUm well maybe now I'd like to take it back to Brazil or I may I think uh the question is not time but a structural incentives\nParticularly if you want to make government work which really and part requires making Congress work\nWe have our own challenges here in the United states but it's important that we not closed the hour without noting a fundamental structural impediments\nTo a decent governance in Brazil which is that you've got now Twenty one party's sitting in the Senate thirty parties sitting in the Congress bows or records for Brazilian democracy at least in the current era\nAnd because of the extreme system of proportional representation one reason why you had so much corruption in Brazil is the president's need to throw throw around money corrupt lay in order to set a assemble congressional majorities out of this mix\nAnd as the former president Fernando Enrique car does those said they've got to fix the system and create a more rational smaller party Congress\nMm uh Laura king is just if I if I can I mean we've been focusing on Brazil a lot because it's a very rightly points out it's just happened and there's a lot of specific things to talk about ah regarding of Brazil at the moment but you know should have done this earlier Loren I'm Sorry that I didn't\nRise of ah the strongman trend we should we saying we talked about the Philippines and talked about Brazil um we you mentioned the United states even Russia China what else would you would you include in that list\nWhen I did have a chance to spend time recently in Poland and Hungary and I would certainly count them among among this trend and I would say I'm Still in touch with some people in Egypt and turkey from the time that I spent there when I when I Lived in those countries and there's a there's a sense of\nReal alarm in a real sense that things are getting worse and worse to turkey in Egypt as well okay now Larry earlier in the hour mentioned a Modi\nIn India does he fall into this category oh I think definitely and Larry what do you think\nI think a motor used in no way a blatant or a photo of democracy to ... you know really believes I'm\nInvested in elections are and it's never spoken about closing down democracy but he certainly leaning hard on opposition and on civil liberties and that's a warning sign to really watch carefully\n... well let's go to Connie who's calling from Seattle, Washington county you're on the air\nHigh that I was wondering how much if this might be a reaction to the global women is not that we think recently ah I Know and actually it's quite a macho culture I don't know if there's some anxiety\nAround which I'm a ... I Know when it's done and also um advocates for other civil rights causes and be a threat to our authoritative here authoritarian strongman dictatorships so I didn't have a a\nA sociologist there or is he saying anything in his face them kind of affected lick reaction to that level a\nTiny thanks for your call Larry Diamond what do you think I think that uh our\nThere was a reference to the threat from cultural and social change the driving a lot of the some of ... turn in reaction\nAnd it's not only three decades or more of the women's rights movement but gay rights from a immigrant rights and so on but I don't think this kind of explain the immediate uh six or so both sooner or oh or other right wing all ...\nMaking security and a general failure of government so ... what the caller described as just one of many strands of unused reaction ...\nLet's go to Peggy who's calling from Springfield, Illinois Peggy are on the air\nYes um I've been hearing people talk about that's losing with globalization\nAnd from my observation I think we've made a terrible terrible mistake and equating our democracy with that kind of hard edge capitalism that we are now living on her when it's operates globally ...\n... I think that this solution has been terrible because democracy is something everyone was but then when we say we got it and it's causing chaos and inequality\nPeople get very disillusioned\nYeah ... ... thank you for your call 'cause it's a very important point Laura king will respond to a pay you said because I think the key thing that that Peggy highlights is that", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "30"}
