a link to that at one point radio dot org rabbi rent and burg welcome to the program\nI imagine is your first thoughts today on um how ... how we should be looking at and thinking about what happened on Saturday a tree of life\nI we need to be seeing it in context um when Trump is saying this is so hard to believe and I think this is absolutely\nDevastating a but it's absolutely conceivable given the context of anti Semitism historically and on the rise in America given the context of our lack of protections for gun violence\nGet in the context of ongoing increasing hate crimes in America and the rise of white supremacy\nI'm this absolutely is\nA ... it said that a lot of contacts and and I don't get in the piece that it also sits in the context unfortunately of our history of of murders a in Judaism\nI should note here that we've got a couple of comments that are coming online Nancy banks tells us on Facebook that while I Do not in any way wish to diminish the horror of the killings in Pittsburgh to black men were also murdered last week\nOr possibly a hate crime a lot of heat for one week and in fact a generic point that shooter was it who had who could gunned down those two black men in Kentucky so that whites don't kill allegedly said whites don't kill whites and we also have\nYou know we're not even a couple of weeks off the pipe bombs that were sent to various political leaders around the country as well so that's why I'm trying to want to talk specifically about rising and anti Semitism but also in the broader context of\nA as I keep calling this ecosystem of hate here but but a rabbi written bird tell me a little bit more about um you know\nHow it is that we should look to or what exactly you see in American political leadership right now that maybe the maybe stoking all of this\nI there is a tremendous amount student and we have a a white supremacist administrative action and Trump has been in self attacking George Soros\nShooting he's been making use of the global asked what she does very very often thought that these are\nNew contemporary anti Semitic dog whistles a the idea that there is a Jew who is powerful and I'd front and secretly hot you know funding infiltration is uh is is a very very very ancient idea um but it's it manifesting\nNow in a in a myriad of ways\n[noise] [noise] well I mean Howard Simon let's talk a little bit more about the specific things that um that the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA was really ranting and raving about online I mean ah you know he talked a lot about uh his hatred of\nUm of the ... the Jewish refugee relief organization um highest rate that that originally began as I'm more than a century ago as an organization to a Jewish refugees around the country but now he's a leading organization in the United states helping refugees from all walks of life\nA and that you know he believed that they were encouraging an infestation a ... in the United states and that's one of the reasons why he wanted to\nHe he he murdered people in order to end the assistance to refugees and talk and that there was a conspiracy behind that as well so Howard just talk to me more about about how those threats come together\nWell or this isn't the story just about the Jews are just about the tree of life a synagogue or where I basically grew up [noise]\nIf you know history you know that in a way the Jews are the canaries in the coal mine of social and political disarray\nAnd and and and break down and and I think you need to look at it in that context\nOf the first thing I thought of yesterday morning was the mother Emanuel church in Charleston were quite similar thing happened uh attacking worshipers or in this case in a church I'm fed by a lot of the same\nParanoia and and anger and and and conspiracy\nThinking a then that's how that's how I I look at it uh over the course of history ah conspiracies a conspiracy theories about the Jews have been a convenient and deadly\nA answer easy answer for uh people who are disengaged\nAnd in an anger\nHere in America is part of a medley of hate\nOr that we're seeing across the spectrum or we're seeing we're seeing racially motivated a paranoia we're seeing the religiously motivated paranoia where we're seeing we're seeing politically motivated paranoia\nAnd and the language has gotten harsh on all sides I mean conservatives will tell you and I think they're right some of the\nSome of the language that uh that Democrats have used to\nHave to have lean toward the idea that everything is a fight or that everybody is or who is who is a political opponent is somehow not quite human\nWhat the point we've reached here or there are a lot of reasons for it there are lots and lots of reasons for it uh is is that anybody we disagree with politically\nUh is is subhuman is not quite human is is an other with a capital of that is dangerous in in comprehensible and out to destroy society uh it it seems like the connective tissue of our of our culture has has has has gone missing\nAnd I think the founders when they when they set up our system wanted contention but they relied on the idea that there would be character and the people\nThat there were ... communities communities where people would know each other and us understand each other's humanity even if they disagreed with them politically and and that's kind of disappeared and that that kind of hollowing out of our civic culture\nIs what's allowed this to happen it's what's allowed\nThe shooting in Charleston to happen it's it's what's allowed people to send pipe bombs to democratic leaders it's is what led a Mr powers to\nUh to uh say I'm going in and and head into a a a building that I Know all too well where my parents both taught Sunday school where I was bar mitzvahed\nUm and and the scenes of mayhem there are just a beyond imagining but it it's all part of this larger context of the hollowing out of our civic life\nKinda yeah go ahead [noise]\nI think both sides rhetoric is not helpful in this moment I think yeah I think it's the context in which a group of people have power and I still can have an eye fostering humanizing language\nAnd I presume separating families putting children in case of treating my phone bans\nI'm a ... in ways that that are real and impacts on and people's lives I think it I took it out of this case pardon my my stumbling here um the history of of slavery and of Native American genocide and discrimination against\n\nReport for on point comes from a karma night offering secure data protection

trucker Bertie we're talking about the massacre at Pittsburgh St tree of life\nSynagogue about America's rising broader ecosystem of hate and what to do about it and joined today by David Friedman Howard Simon and rabbi Daniel written bird and rubber ... just before the break we heard the caller a shalom who was taking issue with some things that you had said and and I wanted to give you a chance to respond [noise]\nSo the idea that Trump could not possibly be an anti Semitic because he has a Jewish daughter in law it's getting a Jewish daughter not Jewish son in law\nIs ridiculous it's like saying that he couldn't possibly be in the ... because he's had three wives and somebody observed on Twitter great [laughter] the idea that that somehow or you know all dissolved of his white supremacists stoking of his blaming the the caravan\nOn Soros of his constant attacks on source calling you know calling lock him up even a few days ago at a rally um that he uses the word globalized again and again and again but somehow he's automatically freed from from connection because of his daughter's decision does not resonate with me\nThe idea that George Soros is somehow this um you know is involved in the confiscation of Jewish property is actually a right wing conspiracy theory that has been debunked and stores themselves addressed it in an interview it's not this is he was a fourteen year old in Hungary\nAh when the Nazis were there um\nAnd yeah I I I I really do not understand the Jewish Trump's mindset I Will say that very clearly the Torah commands us\nAgain and again and again to protect the stranger who is among us the vulnerable maybe I commend the thirty six times more than any other myths but in the Torah to protect the stranger because we were\nOn citizen the the immigrant among us and I take that obligation very seriously and I know that those five to ... to paint us as I'm having some sort of secret power operating behind the scenes um are are just part of a larger ...\nRight yeah it is that you Howard yeah how can I just I I definitely will turn this you become but I also just want to sort of put together some other pieces of the the broader puzzle here because I Do wonder why we can't or or not just you know I I I take the point\nThem that is being um if not birds in at least a [noise] I don't I don't know legitimize or not to tamp down by a Republican leadership in amassed out right now can I speak to that because I've been covering them for years and I've got several people have even just in the past week but please go ahead go ahead\nNo no I I to to to take it through through the eyes of showing them if I can for a second and the notion that Donald Trump is the best friend the Jews overhead\nIs utterly wrong or and here's the reason uh for the Jews to live in peace and security in the United states\nUh we need the the ideals in the uh the ideals that the founders put forth and what's best in us to be not only president but but evident\nAnd and and the Jews survive\nAnd thrive in places where there is a free exchange of ideas where everyone is regarded as part of the community and no one has written out of the story on the theory that they're not human\nAnd and what Donald Trump has done is that he is taken every\nThread of discord cynicism hatred in fear that has always been resident in American Life going back to the very beginning we were talking about slavery we're talking about the Native Americans have cetera he's he's gathered every one of those\nBloody threads in his hands and rhetorically is used them to get elected and is using them to govern I'd I don't you like the phrase white supremacist just because it sounds like\nToo much of rhetoric and and and propaganda but the truth is that he rose to power on fear the rose to power on fear of the other or whether it was a in Central Park or on the caravan or anywhere else in American Life he has an on\nUnbelievable gift for gathering those threads together and rhetorically using them to gain power\nAnd that is a scenario that is the worst possible scenario for the Jews and indeed for everybody else in this country and that that's the concern there is no doubt that he's weaponized all these things politically and that's the moment that were in\nHe has no matter how he chooses to use it by virtue of being president the United states is the most powerful\nThe apples from the past several months earlier this week before the shooting at tree of life house majority leader Kevin McCarthy put up a tweet warning\nOr that three wealthy Jewish Democrats including George Soros Michael Bloomberg were quote buying the midterm election he deleted that tweet before the shooting on Saturday but it was up there\nFor a while I people have perhaps heard of the fact that ... Representative Steve king of Iowa in August\nAfter visiting Auschwitz gave an interview to a right wing Austrian party that has historical ties to Nazis you know talking about uh that he was in support of their their far right groups and that emphasizing hardline anti immigration stances\nUm and that the western civilizations on the decline and that he said if the is this party were in America pushing the platform they push they would be Republican\nAnd we also have for example Senator Chuck Grassley looking to uh George Soros and saying he he can believe that ... may have funded the quote unquote mobs that protested against judge Kavanaugh so like all of these or I should say justice Kavanaugh now but all of these things\nTogether to me seemed to be I don't know is it just you know political cynicism using these conspiracy theories some of it is true belief but that this is this an ecosystem that I'm Talking about here that has grown up and Donald Trump may be and how come of that ecosystem and so if if it that is the case\nUh Howard let me just turn back to you and what do we do about it I mean we even have Lou Dobbs on the day of this shooting on Saturday ... running an an ... a conversation with judicial watch where the guest says that there's a store is occupied State Department\nYou know I heard that comment about the SARS occupied State Department\nI think the only answer is leadership is voting as David Was saying uh with uh people have to get out and it in in an express their views and their their concerns as we are are designed to do in America which is through the ballot box next week and then in the twenty twenty election\nSo voters have to an individual ... by individual voting it also has to be leaders we have a paradoxical system here in the sense that it's of the people by the people for the people\nAre it's from the bottom up but we in order for it to work properly we need leaders of conscience and character\nAnd and and and I would say the answer is we will hear it when we hear it\nFrom from somebody\nIt was a community and uh we're individuals and we prize individual wisdom in America but we're also community and we can't operate without that so it's going to take leaders to come forward to to convince Americans as a whole but there is an answer to using\nFear and hatred is a way to gain power uh there's there's gotta be that's that's the only way forward\nRight well rather read Bergen David should have been I Know you want to get a word in here but I Do have to make some space for our callers who've been patiently waiting so let me just go briefly to Lois who's calling from Northampton, Massachusetts Louis you're on the air\nHello thank you for taking my call I'm voting I don't know about leadership um education to talk of a Jew\nAs hum a conspirator somebody as I shouldn't hand\nDirecting things manipulating things from behind the scenes this has been a staple it's absolutely central to modern anti Semitism since at least the late Nineteen centuries there's absolutely no question when a Soros and others are vilified secondly I think the issues of\nThe president having Jewish members of his family or his support for the current government of Israel's policies those are entirely separate issues from the question of fomenting hate and violence and white supremacy in this country so that's not confuse them", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "29"}
