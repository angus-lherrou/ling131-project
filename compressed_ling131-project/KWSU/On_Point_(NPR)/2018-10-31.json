V. E. okay\nYou obviously cannot do that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws be executive action and obviously as conservatives you know we believe in and and the constitution you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plane\nVery very laying the constitutional process where we obviously totally agree with President is getting at the road issue here which is on track illegal immigration\nThat's how ... Speaker Paul Ryan speaking to W. V. okay in Kentucky\nOr just yesterday well joining us now is Ellen ... he's joining us from Miami and he is immigration reporter for USA Today we have links to his reporting on the radio dot org\nAs well Alan Gomez welcome back to the program thanks for having me All right so you just heard that Paul Ryan they're saying that what he thinks the president is really getting at is this route issue unchecked illegal immigration\nAnd you know today it this morning in the course of an hour and a half the president pumped out one two three four five tweets\nAre about to immigration specifically so how central is this as an issue to Republicans in this midterm uh season\nI mean it's really become the issue um it's it's I think it started\nFrom Trump um he obviously this is something that worked for him and twenty sixteen I'm it wrote into the White House from his first press conference announcing his presidential campaign um he was talking about Mexicans and\nWhich Mexicans are coming into the country and all that um and he wrote that through to the White House and so for him he's just taking a page out of his twenty sixteen political playbook\nAnd applying it to this midterm uh men it's and it seems like something that just kind of struck him just a few weeks ago because it was really the care of and that really started at all um since October sixteenth um is running really started to you know they get in on this such has been a couple of weeks but in that time\nHe has threatened to cut five hundred million dollars in aid to Central America threaten to tear up the new NAFTA deal threaten the seal the entire southern border deployed these five thousand military troops to the border is considering suspending all asylum claims on the southern border\nAll for a group of migrants that's down to about thirty five hundred people at the post at this point that it's still about nine hundred miles away [noise] um so he started it but the Republican Party has wholeheartedly embraced in 'em and they've been arguing\nThis same tax they've been taking the same tax\nUh for for weeks now and you see it in Senate races you see it in local house districts that are far far far from the border um so it's really become a central component um is not the defining issue of their campaign\nHow much is it resonating ah with with voters because when we talked about Democrats and healthcare last week one thing that reporters from around the country were telling us was that voters wanted to talk about health care are we seeing the same thing\nIf you pull all Americans um\nNumber one is health care and number two is jobs and the economy a gun policy is number three\nImmigration is fourth and this according to the Kaiser Family foundation poll but if you only isolated out the Republicans immigration is the number one issue some so clearly it's working for the target audience that they're intending to um you know immigration is what riled up the ... one of the things that really riled up his base in twenty sixteen\nAnd so after a summer where everybody was talking about this blue wave about in record numbers of of of enthusiasm when it comes to democratic registrations in early voting and all that [noise]\nThis is an attempt and this is a way to rile up the Republican base I mean there's no there's no work in the middle here there's no trying to get swing voters with with what they're doing right now this is strictly an issue this strictly something that they're trying to do to rile up the Republican base in ... in ... there turn out next week\nWell let's get a call here let's go to Jay who's calling from Baltimore, Maryland Jay you're on the air\nThank you I feel like I'm a centrist here because I look at the immigration issue and I say\nAs a Democrat I feel like it exposes Democratic Party because it's so simple way of illegal and legal ... migration and the president and I'm fifty years old and for fifty years we've been talking about illegal immigration and he's trying to solve it\nAnd it just seems kind of crazy we well I don't think the big issue but I think it's a simple one to solve and he's trying to do that the obviously wants to change birthright citizenship which should not be such a contentious thing I mean I'm a pro immigration guy I'm just a pro legal immigration Democrat\nI Believe in immigration and then but I Do think health care is much higher priority for me and what I Do and I think that\nThe Democrats and Republicans both want to make changes but there's so many entrenched interests it's virtually impossible and I think each one claims each other and nothing gets done yeah things that do get done or not productive\nWell Jay thank you so much for your call Ellen Goodman let me turn back to you on that because one thing that changed comment makes me think of is it Republicans are pushing hard on the immigration issues I mean ... advertising in debate on the campaign trail in interviews\nAre ... are Democrats are responding or they just simply ... trying to ignore immigration is an issue and focusing exclusively on health care and does that put them at a slight weakness when it comes to dealing with as you said at least in Republican mind the number one important issue for them\nOn the one hand it's difficult for Democrats really to to to be arguing too much on immigration just because it's\n\nSupport for on boy comes from the listeners have WVU or Boston from Charles River a pair of making the New England a range ... since Nineteen eighty three committed

a chocolate bar ... we're talking this hour about it\nHe's with us from Miami and with us from El Paso Texas is ... he's immigration and border security reporter\nFor the Texas Tribune and we've got lots of listeners comment coming here here on line on Facebook mark first tells us Paul Ryan said unchecked illegal immigration is the big issue it isn't unchecked Obama deported loads of people in town and Trump continues to do it albeit with very different tones\nAnd then mark said the problem is not being able to agree on what rates and types of immigration are the most beneficial for the country well let's go to Laurie now who's calling from Davenport, Iowa Laurie you're on the air\nThank you I I just wanted to say that\nI Am totally in favor of sending troops to the border\nThey care I think we need to protect our borders I think President Trump does not want any violence down there but it's obvious that\nThe people are getting aid somewhere they have water bottles they have so they have money or something is sponsoring this and we need to protect America and also on another no I Believe in voter ID I had to get one to get a library card\nI have to have identification to get a loan\nTo open a credit card to get a library card just starting to charities there's nothing racist about it and everybody has to do it why can't they have id to vote\nWill Lorrie thank you so much for your call there or I wouldn't go I mean you hear Laurie from feeling very strongly about sending troops to the border and even about voter id so she's probably one of those voters that we were talking we're talking about earlier who is immigration is is front and center number one in terms of the concerns the issues are concerned about [noise]\nYeah and it's interesting as you mentioned the idea is one violence at that southern border um you know that's an idea that we've been hearing a lot about from the president and from other Republicans who have been warning about his curve and\nUm but I think it's important to provide some context to what these current events or like I mean first of all if they're coming into the ... they're they travel encourage branch for their own security I'm traveling by yourself or in small groups or Central America Mexico is a very dangerous and never\nUm so they for ... years ago to just to make it there are more safely them in the last ... curve and that got here and then provides a little bit of insight into what their intentions are um they arrived in April there was about five hundred of them that ended up making it to the border\nUm about a hundred and twenty two of them were caught illegally entering the country but four hundred and one of them um did exactly what they said they didn't\nI did with the care of and moving through Mexico um the it's clear that that's that's what's going on here um it it's not going to be five ten thousand people that arrived at the border it's already shrunk down to thirty five hundred\nAnd again they still have nine hundred miles to go um that's the equivalent of walking from Boston to Knoxville, Tennessee so it's going to take a long time and by the time they get here it's going to be far fewer people than not exactly the kind of numbers that are going to be able to overwhelm or takeover us port of entry\nWell and especially with possibly the United states military there as well but but I'm an hour and a little early in the show and then just clarify here that they aren't even the ... the mayor Lee denied asylum claims to anyone who makes them when they arrive at the border\nThat is uh the the the last bomber waiting for him before the election comes the this is something that they were talking about that they were considering uh mid ... they were planning the Tuesday rollout of this but things got pushed back because of the Pittsburgh shooting and some of the other\nTragedies we've seen recently um but yeah that is still a possibility um you know basically they're they're considering using the same rationale um that they use to implement the travel ban\nA shortly after Trump took office\nIt was the first two versions of the travel ban were shot down by the courts but the third one survived and so they're looking at the legal right rationale behind that one and trying to apply somewhat similar argument to what's going on along the southern border to claim that this is some kind of national emergency that it's a threat to national security\nAnd the president should have the authority to at least temporarily suspend asylum up applications that will surely be challenged in court the second if and when he announces it um but yeah that's one more thing that they could throw out here\nRight now who argue that you're there in El Paso and I was like if you could talk to us about how his playing out in a particularly interesting Texas congressional race the one uh ... between income representative\nA Republican we'll heard and Gina Ortiz Jones or his Democratic challenger right because the debt that district that heard represent as many hundreds of miles up on the border\nCorrect It's got about eight hundred miles of the ... border and it stretches from a free pass a county\nAll the way to the outskirts county which is includes San Antonio and then several border counties in between you know this this this was considered a closer a few months ago but the latest polling shows that um comic trying to hurt us\nThe challenge and could still you know that that's the thing when when people mention poll numbers today they always go back to twenty sixteen and say well you know the polls were wrong then so I think that's giving\nThe Democrats and and the protects us a little bit of hope but\nI'm ... congressman heard also you know it was very public about his his the way he strives for bipartisanship hum you know he and and ... actually they you know they did that Facebook Live where you know DC was was snowed in and they had to drive back to to DC and they they ended up doing the ... of their journey which\nI think when I'm ... pretty good way for\nFor both of the Congress to show that they they are able to work together and rural voters in Texas you know they're concerned about the wall and imminent domain and issues like border security but they are also I'm a ... by and large a lot of them are are frustrated at some of what they they think is an action you know you talked to [noise]\nTo ranchers all along the border and they say you know they have to fix their fans are they have to call border patrol or people are going to their property and that's not to say they're not also compassionate and they realize you know that a lot of these people are just coming to work or to escape\nYou know their their home countries to seek a better life but they do think that something should be should be done about it so I think congressman hurt in the minds of of his constituents has done a pretty good job of of trying to strike a middle balance he's been\nSomewhat outspoken at least early on about some of the president's policies but closer to election day he's he's obviously you know it helps them to go more towards the middle and stay in line with Republican values but not to the to the extreme and um and to to Mr to Mr Gomez is point earlier with respect to the to the caravan\nHe's absolutely right with respect to we don't know how many people are gonna end up coming here and what I saw on the Brits and she was on Tuesday was migrants that were lined up at the port of entry waiting to get processed so with respect to the caller's concerns in illegitimate concerned about who's coming into the country\nIf you're a violent criminal lawyers can fit to come in undeterred it's not likely that you're going to present at the port of entry when a lot of people are definitely\nDo that to her Jones interesting to me because we didn't think he he represents since you were saying earlier how hum\nViews of community on the border I'm much more they're more subtle and texture than we might see it as we get further and further away actually from from the border 'cause I Know hurting the eloquent hum advocate for more smart well technology versus hard wall high technology between the United states and Mexico\nBut we got a lot of callers here so let's go to them Allison is calling from Baltimore, Maryland you on the Alan\nHi magna thanks for taking\nUm and to play defense against emotional appeals to stay focused on this rational discussion um I think there's a lot of winning points that the Democrats have it I think they do work brings that out surveys show that the American public\nFavors a permanent status for the dreamers sort of permanent status and I think the Democrats and make the point that immigration solve the problem with immigration and be solved immigration reform rather than through posting troops on the border\nAllen thank you for your call I'm Ellen governments let me turn to you is that what you're hearing from Democrats are we hearing more are softer tone [noise]\nWell I mean I think it's interesting there do they use the word emotional when it comes to the Democratic response because\nIt in to some degree ... there was there was quite a bit of fear for the over the over the summer of what this abolish ice movement that that only a very small number of Democrats really truly embrace um but that became something that was slept on everybody every democratic candidate Ted Cruz is cruise better route\nOf of of of bracing that um and that that is one of the sort of that's a that's a very good example where", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "31"}
