Alexis ... an on point use analyst Jack Beatty I also want to remind listeners that we're tracking or what's going on\nOn NPR broadcasts and also on line at NPR dot org I Do want to turn to uh to the climate report done by the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental planted a panel on climate change as commissioned by the United nations or which had very stark\nAh conclusions about uh the world's climate where it was headed and what kinds of actions were needed to even just mitigate damage\nDuring an interview with on point on Tuesday drew ... at Duke University climate scientist and one of the co authors of the report explained the past climate change models had been if anything much too conservative and that we're seeing the results of not changing our habits quickly enough\nWe'd seen hurricanes hold more water we've seen coastal areas get flooded we've seen the occurrence of these extremes go up so we're not just relying on these models we're actually seeing that the models or have if anything been kind of to conservatives and we are now reaching areas of\nDangerous and damaging impact [noise] more quickly than we realize we would back in the eighties\n[noise] total older and meet them or how the government responding to this a panel just this report\nI without much action actually if you're looking specifically at the White House which drives so much for the policy and the federal government\nThere's not a lot of action is being taken to a combat this fast moving problem of of climate change or we've seen the president you know try to talk about how climate change a hoax he said that in the past and\nI had an initiation has rolled back a lot of the regulations that were put in place by the previous administration to try to get ahead of this issue we did see the president pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year a saying that it was not fair to the United states it's it's an agreement that basically all of the countries in the world I agreed to in order to try to slow\nThe uh for the impact and the onset of of climate change uh this is the president that really wants to focus more on um you know reducing regulations are investing in a traditional forms of energy and up as you said putting coal miners back to work\nAnd he hasn't spent as much time focusing on these very dire warnings that we're getting from scientists about what will happen if action isn't taken to a to slow the impact of climate change on on the planet\nOr I'd like to take a call now from west Brookfield, Massachusetts I Believe it's Bob Bob you're on the air\nI thanks for taking my call Yes sir\nTurn away from it there's no bigger issue in this report anything\nIt tells me that people who claim to say that they will do anything to protect their families protect their children they really are not telling the truth unless they get engaged and are willing to\nStart seeing those changes in pushing enforcing those changes from the bottom up because it ain't gonna happen from the top down\nThanks so much for that call a bomb or a Lexus I asked totally what a action have been taken a it at the White House what kind of just reaction has there been from ah from leaders on health particular Republican leaders\n[noise] well I don't want an element of the un report was born out immediately in the reaction as as you're questioning and and he at the held a news organization I work with our environmental reporter went to the hell went around on Wednesday was trying to talk to lawmakers who are on the right committee or would normally be interested\nAnd came away writing a story that he couldn't find anybody who would read it now why would that be that's because we're just a couple of weeks before a mid term elections and a ... the un report said that there were very limited options because time is now very very short to try to have some\nFunctional impact on this trend but that the political will is not there and that was the reaction that we are\nDiscovered right away and as Tony said the president has said you know oh there's lots of reports that this report is just among hundreds that he is willing to reject or ignore and so whether it was the White House or Capitol Hill it was just a big you know cricket\nMakes it sound like sort of yet another parking ticket whereas the\nIssues at stake are quite dire need this is an issue obviously we hear it on point will continue to coverage I Do want to move on to the swearing in of a new justice on the Supreme Court one of nine a Brett Kavanaugh appeared at the White House there was sort of a a a ceremonial swearing in that his he'd already been formally sworn in but he appeared at the White House uh\nAnd at that time the newly minted justice Brett Kavanaugh assured Americans he would be an independent impartial justice devoted to equal justice under law and part of the Supreme Court team of nine\nI was not appointed to serve one party or one answer is but to serve one nation America's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief and every backgrounds every would again the Supreme Court\nJack Beatty at you've heard the new justice or can you are a few short than to listen to the litigants arguments with respect or an open mind well\nHe had to say that didn't he based on his\nLittle ... in front of the Senate committee attacking the Democrats as part of the big conspiracy and we heard everything except big guys the come out of his mouth he was so deeply into Republican paranoia [noise]\nUh so yeah he had to reassure us on that score but will you know there's no check on him a lifetime appointment he can say what he will if I might let me just quickly returned to that climate change report because\nYou know it's clear enough the challenge of this poses to as a GOP or some people call it the grand oil party which has deep into purchased denialism but what about the Democrats\nJames Hansen the climate scientist and a recent paper said we will go to negative admissions now basically or\nWe will have to invest eighty nine trillion to five hundred trillion dollars over the next century just pulled the carbon it's in the atmosphere out partly through developing as yet unheard of technologies\nWhat does that say to the Democrats when they went to Bernie Sanders when he was free college for everybody when he says we need the universal health care\nWhen they talk about guaranteed jobs where is this money going to come from it costs at a party that caused by keeping true to their rhetoric\nYes yes and and and yet they want to pose as the part while we're in we're concerned about the climate if they're concerned about the climate their agenda has to change to reflect this civilization all crisis\nAlexis demanding or is there any sense going back to the new justice or that are thinking about the elections that are that the Republicans will pay a price for a for cabin are what they did that now look as though they'll be a little bit used by that the enthusiasm of conservatives returning to the fold\nWhile listening to Republican leaders in Washington as well as some pollsters who are watching these racist very carefully there suggesting on taking of Mitch McConnell has been doing some victory lap sort of interviews recently a bunch of them\nAnd they're pointing to polls in which there a Senate candidates are are pulling a hat or doing better than that\nA Mitch McConnell the majority leader in the Senate is ear to say that that little bumpy thinks it's coming from what happened with Kavanaugh in fact\nAs you know when the NPR interview he said it it happened just at the right time he thought the timing was just perfect even though he said it wasn't planned that way to be so contentious right before the election\nAnd ... and a Democrat that not disputed that they're they believe that Democrats are very motivated and might themselves be very motivated about what they saw particularly women\nWomen voters but uh the Democrats are not disputing that Republicans have perhaps gotten a little bit of a bump\n[noise] support for on point comes from the listeners have W.

news analyst Jack Beatty you can join the conversation what other stories are moving you this week what's on your radar what's not getting enough coverage\nOr one hundred forty three eight to five five ... hundred for two three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook\nAt on point radio or one of our callers are called to admonished us for spending time on Kanye West visit to the White House at all but I think it's part of a piece of understanding where the president is coming from what's on his mental landscape what does he sharing with us\nHe also had some a sharp words at a rally a in Council Bluffs Iowa on Tuesday the president had harsh words for those who oppose him\nHanded mattress during our son is and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats\nWe've heard a lot of rhetoric from Republicans about the Democrats in their opponents being object ... where's this rhetoric coming from\n[noise] well yeah and let's just get up for the test was called the Democrats evil the party of crime they want to destroy our country liberals are quote very very bad people\nYou know in the ah October nineteenth two thousand sixteen debate the president was that then candidate Trump was asked will you abide by the results of the election\nAnd he said I Will look at it at the time I Will keep you in suspense it could be rigged now we have to be in suspense about two thousand and twenty is it likely that the president will turn over power should the Democrats win\nWe've reached the point where this sort of ultimate alarm is almost common sense about Trump is ed lose my heavens writing in the Financial Times it's no leap to imagine Trump refusing to accept election defeat that's that's a long step\nFrom where we are but certainly the rhetoric is charged he's talking about mob rule elect to some degree you've been hearing that from a congressional figure some of them on Capitol Hill as well what are you hearing that's driving that rhetoric what did they point to and and you know what is it really grounded on\nWell first of all when we first started to hear this discussion about an angry mob it was a talking point it was very clear because Republicans including the president were all speaking with the same voice so it had been focus grouped with a talking point and pollsters where suggesting that Republicans would profit by doing this\nAnd part of this is because an election season no matter what party here and you're trying to draw very sharp contrast and mobilize your own base to turn out and we know that Republicans\nHad been very concerned that their base is not as mobilized or as excited about turning out in the mid term election at Democrats may be so\nI don't like yeah let me just stop you there to help underscore your point a during on points a trip to Pennsylvania last weekend uh we ... valley resident Dorothy new clothes told our co host magnet chocolate party that people are getting tired of constant protest from Democrats\nThe Democratic party has gone so far to the left and\nI don't know if you will always have a divide there because you're having the\nPatriots versus the socialists\nAnd the ... and ... until\n... sit down and discuss things and not have one faction running around with silly things on their heads and signs and everything that goes I mean they're just they're everywhere\nAnd that's from on points that field reporting from Pennsylvania a in that case about out congressional redistricting the redistricting is affecting states\nHotly contested midterm races you can find more about that on our website on point reader dot org but electric to allow you to continue a little bit you know if there's something more than what they're saying about sort of mob than simply the people were protesting I mean you know freedom of assembly is a constitutional right that's hardly seems like mob rule to me\nWell it is but it sparked a debate about what is our our ... in our in our body politic what is free speech and what is going over the line at of course Democrats are furious because they argue that the president himself has very incendiary and his rhetoric\nPoint out that the Republican effort to drop sharp contrast started before Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd you can see when Alexandra a Ocasio Cortez won her race at in New York and defeated\nA Joe Crowley long term incumbent and it is running as a socialist that there were a lot of eyebrows raised a and hands or being rubbed together in the Republican Party about while we can really use this because\nThe effort there to say that the entire Democratic Party is being pulled to the left to the left to the left\nAnd you know you can see that there are a variety of candidates are anticipating perhaps running for president or in these house races that fit into a mall that the president and Republicans are using to showcase a kind of activism that they want to paint as going too far\nIt's interesting 'cause there's a tension and it's almost as though there is seen as in parallel but sense of kind of different to me about tension about whether to be pulled it left\nA among Democrats a and you've seen that play on some congressional primaries in races and also tension about how strongly to to fight for a you know the political success\nOr earlier this week a former attorney general Eric Holder of course served in the Obama administration spoke at a campaign event for Georgia democratic gubernatorial candidates Stacey Adams\nA reference Michelle Obama's often repeated comment when they go low we go high\nEric Holder said no when they go low we kick them that's what this new Democratic Party is about he followed up a few minutes later when I say you\nKnow we don't even do anything for you don't do anything illegal but we're going to be tough and we got to fight for the very things that John Lewis Martin Luther king's when the young\nYou know almost have to be taken away that's the thing to do they want to maintain a house\nThat was a former attorney general Eric Holder speaking at a\nCampaign stop for Stacey Abrams say in Georgia\nA lot of Republicans and conservatives took great offense to lose ... uh they said you know this is wildly inappropriate he further clarified his remarks on Twitter saying OK stop the fake outrage I'm just saying Democrats need to be tough proud and stand up for the values we believe in the end but the president took this is a bit of a rallying cry\nThe president did the RMC did the little the leaders of the Republican campaigns for twenty Eighteen are all sort of seizing on this comment and other comments that are somewhat\nIncite violence uh and it it is it's a talking point that they're really driving home on and the final weeks of the election because as electric said these both both parties see this as a base election where they're trying to motivate their base\nThere has been evidence that Democrats are incredibly motivated in part by their enemies towards the president to turn out in in high numbers and Republicans are trying to match that\nIn part by saying you know these Democrats or socialists they are violent they are part of antifa and you know as the president said they're going to allow crime to come into the country if they take over so it's part of a political strategy will have to wait and see for the next three or four weeks if it works if it does\nSucceed in driving turnout um\nWe did hear from Michelle Obama who sort of push back and said you know the politics of fear is not the politics it's going to win over the long term but there is this debate in the Democratic party about\nHow hard to push and they've seen some of the success of President Trump is hat and and that Republicans have had with hard line type tactics like\nHolding open the Supreme Court seat for a year and they're saying we want some of that on our side we want people to really go to the mat for our policies\nAnd there's a debate between that and and the idea that we need more civility in our politics we're going to beat them by going high when they go low and that internal debate is still playing out and it's been happening in different ways in different parts of the country we've seen more moderate Democrats win in some places we've seen\nDemocratic socialism progressive went in other places and uh what's gonna happen in November is going to have a big impact on in determining how the Democrats move forward in twenty twenty and what kind of party they want to be for the next parts of the presidential race\nI'd like to take a call now from Detroit Michigan steeply gotcha what's on your mind [noise]\nHi I Am calling that with a question or comment a general observation and that is I've heard uh\nOn two different NPR talk shows this morning\nThis batting back and forth about a Democrats or historical because we said that Trump was administrator fascists like and [noise] ... um I however\nIt's not an intellectual exercise for me in the early Nineteen seventies I was stationed in Spain in the navy on a Franco was still alive so I
