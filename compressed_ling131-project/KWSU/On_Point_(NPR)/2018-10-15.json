little bit of that are on his interview with lead least on sixty minutes this weekend\nI'm you know he made he responded to her questions about\nUh his mocking of Christine Blasey Ford and the president actually told style but he didn't want to get into it because bottom line he said quote we won the cabinet fight and that it's going to help the GOP intimate terms the way\nNow justice Kevin always treated\nHas become a big factor\nIn the midterms having seen what's going on with the polls\nSo enough totally ... let me start with you here what do you make of the president's interview on sixty minutes and sort of how he's placing himself very much in the middle of what's at stake in the midterms\nWhile we do have some interesting decision on his part to defend a an earlier speech that he gave where he sort of made fun of Christine Blasey Ford and talked about how she couldn't remember any of the critical detail and he took credit for that and it's helping really lock in judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nSeems like the Republicans were going to hold on to the side of the Democrats were going to retake the house now that seems all the more likely ah it seems like it's going to be really tough for the Democrats to retake the fed it but they have a very good shot\nAt the house and part of that you would expect to see any way because while there was an enthusiasm gap more Republicans are showing excitement about the polls and that's something you expect to see us in election approaches but I think it was accelerated by the Kavanaugh fight\nAnd a real us versus them dynamic that takes place it's not unusual what we're seeing with a Republican voters where you know early on that we're maybe not that enthusiastic but now that they're faced with the prospect of a takeover by the opposition\nAre getting more excited and more enthusiastic so I think some of what the president says it's true in a sense of the dividing line to sharpen and I think some of it would have happened anyway\nI see and I used to what's your take on it\nI think that a a a lot of that is definitely the case it does seem like the Senate is getting more locked in perhaps for the Republicans and now you have the house looking more and more like it there will be a takeover by\n[noise]\nSupport for on point comes from exact science has offering color guard for average risk

questionnaire uncommon a leader [noise] we went through a rally in return or are you a for trial and it was almost like a trip to grow all ah it\nWas just absolutely wonderful um\nHe's a boy or a sharp produced a driver or [noise] um\nOther than a hasty Steve we're just starting or before I get you a question because I Do I Do want to hear your question but since you said you went to that Richmond, Kentucky rally or with the president\nThis weekend um and he said it was wonderful I'm just wondering when the president says things that are demonstrably untrue um you know when he basically says the Democrats want open borders to flood the country with criminals you heard that that clip earlier through\n... they don't know I don't think any Democrat who they advocated open borders to flood the country with criminal\nOh yes for half a half you're totally wrong\nTo flood the country with to to flood the country with criminals\nYeah that's correct and my Thirteen got out of control\nYes for the ... well I guess what I'm Wondering a Steve is that that the president's asserting that the Democrats won commercials that come into the country no Democrat has ever said that so I'm just wondering when he says things that are that are untrue does that does that trouble you at all\nAnd it's not it's not true because the Trump for correct\nOkay uh and so then you're the question that your your\nYour your sadly wrong\nOr I don't think I've heard a single Democrat say they want to welcome criminals into the country but but you a quick question that you that you had for for for a panel\nKind of a moot point really um you know the question I had was do you think that a President Trump will\nGo easy one day and get somebody from inside the beltway or think she'll go outside to go on for a reporter for ...\nOkay well Steve thank you so much for your call or necessarily been David let me turn to you first let's just take us Steve question there about a a a questions about the future of General Mattis as secretary of defense there okay what do we know\nI was raised because during the sixty minutes interview the president said something about that it's being sort of something like sort of a Democrat or something like that which clearly he did not intend to\nPraise and probably was suggesting that a man's has somewhat more [noise] you know perhaps dovish abused for lack of a better term and the president doesn't certain things in that raised a lot of questions about whether or not\nUh Madison was going to stay that long after the midterms the midterms are traditionally of time with a lot of cabinet members may leave and perhaps Madison's on that list [noise] um I think it's a little early to know where he would go for a replacement I mean there's generally you go into the military community or to a former law\nWe spend our new I've got a very much clearer signal from the White House but the possibility that Madison might not be around for much longer or was in the air\nOkay Ayesha Rascoe I had to ask the caller about what he thought of\nWhen the president says things that are are untrue and obviously he took exception to that but I the reason why I had asked that is because at these rallies that the president does say things that that we can prove are have no\nNo no evidence behind them and I ... I guess I was just wondering how much that has an impact on on people who\nAre are going to these rallies how much impact that might have on potential swing voters we heard at least with the with our caller that it makes no difference to him whatsoever because he doesn't think any of it is untrue and I just want to know your response to\nThat for people at those rallies and and I've been to a few rallies I I was at a rally in Iowa at last week I think our\nTime runs together with a with a with a President Trump but the people at these rallies and they were so energized\nThey were amped up they are you know they are true believers\nSo I I don't know whether they take everything that Trump says that the literal truth or they know they say that maybe he's joking sometimes but they they are his fans regardless if he does say things like he'll say there are thousands of people outside and that that\nThat clearly won't be true waiting for his rally they're not thousands of people outside\nBut he says these things\nI but I don't know that at this point whether it makes much of a difference to the people that support him that like ... ah that are entertained by the things that he said and that the the the core things that he says resonates with them for a swing voters\nIf you are skeptical of President Trump then these things being point pointed out a make you may make you questioned him even more but but you kind of have to start from a place of if you're already questioning President Trump\nRight So Adam Smith the that same question to you as as as I used to seem as if it's the the swing voters who could be a influence or or push either way of based on what the president says things that are that are both true and and don't have any basis in fact\nAnybody can find these swing voters I'm struggling to find them everybody so dug in on both sides but I Will say you know sometimes I think the media and the pundit tree of culture\nSeriously no he's not literally in love with the leader of North Korea or no he doesn't literally St Elizabeth Warren is Pocahontas but there are things that are that the the crowds and they are just an enormous crowds uh don't quite take literally like we do now that isn't\nIt had our caller who said that everything the president said was true and yeah and it looks back on me several times and if he\nCan my email is a Smith a Tampa Bay dot com if he can email me the name of a single Democrat that said he wants to open borders more criminals can come in you know I Will happily eat my reporter's notebook [laughter] barbecue and maybe I mean just to jump in the eyes had enough time I mean it may\nBe that he wasn't saying that Democrats are declaring that they're in favor of criminals coming in has meant that the impact of everything that they want to do I mean that's sort of I took what he was trying to change but to me the color you are really exemplified the extent to which were in this country in a very much an us versus them situation\nAnd the people who are motivated seems to me ah as much or more by hatred sometimes with the other side as belief in their own side it's one reason I think that as we approach the election\nOr there's more energy from the Republicans because the prospect of democratic takeover pointing to people like\nNot only Nancy Pelosi but even Hillary Clinton as a villain who could be empowered if the election goes the wrong way and it's a very resonant with a lot of people and it's I think we're seeing one reason for the energy on on both sides really this absolute\nA disc taste and dislike an aversion to people in the other side of the political debate\nWell let's go to David who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma you're on the David\nHi magnum panel I I was watching the sixty minutes interview and I was absolutely astonished that Trump's projection of\nThe street and the viciousness ah putting that on the Democrats um which is something we typically does is just sort of you know smoke and mirrors everything I mean if you look at the Capitol hearings as an example first talk address this are supposed to be\nImpartial he does Fox News interviews he brings Hillary Clinton up in his opening statement a for a doctor or drop apologizes for Kavanaugh and history but I'm not a word about Dr Ford\nUm but then you go to the actual questioning and the Republicans I realized that Lindsey Graham was you know auditioning for the attorney general spot but he and Grassley and Kennedy and cruise they weren't like rabid dogs I mean they completely lost their composure and\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSupport for on point comes from W.

joined today by ... votes\nThe Taliban David joins us as well as an editor at the wall Street Journal Washington bureau and and we've got lots of comments coming in here's one from our website or on point radio dot org DX oath says the fact that Florida keeps being hit with storm should make them start to think twice about politicians like governor Rick Scott\nWho denied climate change and\nSince we're just talking about storms and climate change we should play this moment from President Trump's interview with Leslie stall on sixty minutes\nA lovely still open with hurricane Michael it asks the president if he still thinks climate change is a hoax now the president didn't necessarily a he said he didn't necessarily trust scientists because he believes scientists have a political agenda uh and then he said this\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs\nI don't want to be put in a disadvantage\nAyesha Rascoe let me just turn to you quickly on that I mean the scientific consensus is overwhelming that our current at the climate change that we're seeing is indeed a human driven or human exacerbated just your your thoughts on hearing that clip from the president [noise]\nIt was interesting because when\nThe when the White House and when President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year there were a lot of questions from reporters are constantly you know asking uh the the White House does President Trump still believe that climate change is a hoax and they kind of refused to answer and at that time\nPresident Trump wasn't giving interviews I keep giving now\nSo this is like the first time that he was really pressed on climate change since he became president and he basically repeating even though he's not the said it's not a hoax he's still repeating this idea that he doesn't really believe it or he doesn't think that it's really an issue\n... well uh I should note that the president tweeted today that he's going to Florida in Georgia with the first lady to tour hurricane damage and visit with FEMA first responders and law enforcement or so to that point let's go to a color here bath is calling from St Petersburg Florida you're on the air Beth\nHi uh I'm just curious I'd love to hear Adams perspective on the impact that politics will play on recovery of hurricane Michael because here you have Trump coming and um and he sort of control\nBack yard pretty much up here on\nThat best thank you for your call Adam go ahead\nWell if I'm One of the people in those are hard hit communities in North Florida I'm actually should be pretty happy that this that everything is so political and we're just a few weeks away from the election because lord knows Rick Scott and Donald Trump or going to do everything they can to look like they are effectively responding to this thing\nUh that said you know you've got some candidates Andrew Gillum a is basically sort of shut down his overt campaigning so he can stay in a\nIn ... in Tallahassee and look like he's involved you've got candidates like Rhonda fan just the fellow who's running for governor who is struggling to get attention and to some extent Bill Nelson our senior senator who whom Rick Scott is running against\nIs also I think having a little bit of a hard time getting noticed so politics never disappears uh but that said I I think it's a it's a very very big motivator to respond properly\nYeah well let's switch gears here than and talk about ah the increasing tensions and questions around uh\nThe disappearance and as the as the as Turkish officials are saying the murder of journalist and dissident Tim all a ...\nAnd the Taliban David or the president's tweeting today that he just spoke to the king of Saudi Arabia and the king denied any knowledge whatsoever of whatever may have happened to show the a and that now the president President Donald Trump saying he immediately sending secretary of state Mike Pompeo\nTo meet with the Saudi king your thoughts on that well\nIt's a bit of a mixed message coming out of the White House and whether that's by design or simply because that's how they are it's a little bit hard to say uh it's true he did say that about Saudi Arabia reminds me a little bit of some of his comments about a\nPresident Clinton you know he says that uh they denied very strongly that it could be some rogue actors are and in the case of the Russians you may recall he said it could be some four hundred pound guy on a bad idea to have other you know based on you know I don't think a lot of other people suggesting it could be route killers unconnected to\nSaudi Arabia um so the one hand in sixty minutes interview he talked about that there's going to be severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis are behind it and the other hand he's taken the idea of canceling our arms deals with the Saudis off he he he's just\nTaking that off the table a and has talked about how much he has a good relationship with them but then he turns around and sends pump HBO and talks about getting to the bottom of it and it just I think in some ways a reflection of our fairly complex\nRelations with them we sort of counting them to be a stabilizing force in the middle east and the one last thing I just want to say is is President Trump tends to have kind of a personal relationship with leaders that's how he describes and he'll\nHe'll say whether he means it literally are nothing tea and Kim fell in love with each other or he and president Xi have chemistry it's for him a lot about how he feels his personal relationships are with these folks and it's clear that the leader of Saudi Arabia am had been some you know and be asked is people call him\nYou know had a very strong fact not only on a leaders in Washington but also let's face it on many journalists he's a charismatic guy and all these things are complicating factors in as well\nUh enough tally since you mentioned that moment of sixty minutes interview let's hear it or this is when the president told Leslie stall that he would be quote very upset and angry if the Saudi Government a de de de to assassinate ... but then as now Taliban David points out President Trump also that he didn't want to lose big arms contract\nThey ordering military weapon everybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted that China water that we wanted it we got it on would you cut that off like well what I don't want to do blowing Lockheed racy on all these ... I don't want to hurt jobs\nI don't want to lose in order like that there are other ways of a\nHighly shift to use a word that's a pretty harsh words that is true\nThat the president speaking to Leslie stall and sixty minutes this weekend let's go to Jose who's calling from Aspen, Colorado Jose you're on the air\nOh recruited much got her a question or comment\n[noise] um well first of all I Love your last name and there's a\nQuestion if I'm only a Saudi Arabia predicament desert pretty Trump will cut his nose off just by ... and the board of military trend or do ... measures are lower approach to the\n... well I Hope they we just heard that clip of the president on sixty minutes saying he doesn't want to you or do anything to damage those contracts and that there are other ways of quote punishing a the Saudis iffy deems that necessary so perhaps not\n[noise] you know wondering what your journal is okay for a\nWell let me turn to Ayesha Rascoe for her it's not ice you what do you think\nNow that a lot of these are kind of like promises or like intent like kind of letters of interests are intent so ... and all of the money that he's talking about it's not fully locked in so it it's really um I ... I don't want to overstate the amount of of actual military contracts that the U.S\nHas with Saudi Arabia and he also talked about the stock Saudi Arabia kind of just easily going to China or Russia to buy military equipment but they've already invested\nAnd US military equipment so it would be difficult for them they can't just switch over a and go get Russian a Russian equipment or Chinese equipment so this idea that it would be a easy for them to just switch it it's not necessarily true but\nTrump is is kind of making this point that he doesn't want he's drawing the line in the sand\nThat he wants to leave arms deals on the table with Saudi Arabia that set up a a kind of a standoff with Congress because you have law makers who are calling for a hot to uh arms sales to Saudi Arabia and if they decide if you have", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "15"}
