yesterday that she'll step down at the end of the year she and her time at the un is one of the few women in President Trump's cabinet and one of the few if any gender who's come through both unscathed and even more popular than when she when she went in\nQuite a feat for the former South Carolina Governor who was once a leading never Trump voice so how did she balance being America's

Nikki Haley and about her decision to step down at the end of this year we're assessing her time\nAt the un and we're going to talk about very specific issues that she let on and spoke out on here in just a minute but I'm joined today by early on a Johnson White House reporter for Politico and by Colum Lynch un based the cure a senior diplomatic reporter\nAt foreign policy and I just want to play a little bit of sound here of that to get a sense about what Nikki Haley feels or her success was at the un this is actually at a press conference in late September where she said that under President Donald Trump the U.S engages in multilateral as them only on us term\nSince the secretary general meeting last year we have pulled out of the Paris accord we've pulled out of the global contact we have\nPulled out of the Iran deal all of that is to say that the United states is determined to obviously be involved in multi lateral organizations where we see it but not in the way that they are mandated on what the United States does or that infringes on the American people\nSo ambassador Nikki Haley they're talking about an expression of us power in terms of its retraction from a several multilateral agreements the United nations president Antonio ... has a his spokesperson delivered this message about ambassador Haley's work at the un\nStrong working relationship during her tenure as the United states permanent representative\nThey work hard to promote constructive ties between the United nations the United states showing the value of the United nations secretary general's forward to continuing to work with them about sort of Haley until the end of her tenure and of course with her replacement\nAll right well joining us now is Admiral James to read it he's former Supreme allied commander of NATO he served in that position from two thousand nine to two thousand Thirteen dean emeritus at the Fletcher School of law and diplomacy at Tufts University and he's an operating executive now the Carlisle group and author of the leaders bookshelf teams to read as well come back to them point\nGreat to be back with you Mary Ann how's it going\nIt's going very well lots to talk about here and I want to I Want to just get your your your sense about the two different cuts we just heard ambassador Haley saying she defines her success is at the un in part by\nA expressing American power by withdrawing from certain agreements but of course in the diplomatic language of the United nations itself saying that there was a very strong and productive relationship there what's your take\nI I find those statements at variance um I Do want to start by just giving her credit as a person I think as many have said she maintained her independence she struck out\nOn a number of issues and very positive ways and I think she was a very capable are investor for the United states however\nUm I think that again and again this administration has demonstrated a I don't think contempt is too strong a word for the United nations and the organs of diplomacy that surround it in the international constellation\nSo she will have to answer for that as part of her legacy and I think it's a little disingenuous to say that we're very engaged while we're withdrawing from treaties and denigrating international organizations\nOkay well so tell me more about that I mean if you have to answer for that and there were specific moments where she was you know extremely forthright in terms of uh of amplifying the language of the Trump Administration at the un what are some of those moments that you think are particularly were worth paying attention to 'em\nI'd start with the uh on the negative side go withdraw from the climate agreement I think that will go down in history as a significant misstep by the administration kind of a peace with pulling out of the Trans Pacific partnership although of course that's not part of her\nParticular ... on the positive side I think she was extremely forceful on a Syrian violations of international law after use of cats\nThere are some things that Nikki Haley bathroom Hayley said and actions that she she took or positions that she championed at the un that may come back to haunt her if you know in her future political career because she was the line so closely with the president\nYou know whether that's two years or four years from now I Know that's forever in American politics but but that's a reality to this that she's gonna she's got to be wondering about\nListening both to add ... to ... talk and to ah to calm taught\nI I think Nikki Haley did this job with an eye to a future presidential campaign and she will be touting her accomplishments and everything she did at the un\nRunning on the conservative things such as a moving the U.S Capitol championing the move of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem things that the Trump Administration was excoriated for pulling out of that climate deal those are things she can run on the Republican primary\nAnd things that she will have to defend in a general election I'm absolutely\nWell Elliana Johnson White House reporter for Politico joining us from Washington Thank you so much and I was great to have you thank you All right let's get some calls in here let's go to Frida who's calling from Tucson, Arizona Frida you're on the air\n[noise] Hi thank you [noise] so I'm an independent voter have them for decades eminent Jackson is I Do go vote in both parties and I don't think that Nikki Haley came out of this on the case I think her position on Paris\nA Jerusalem and pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal are all major uh\nFumbled on her part I realized that those were positions as a president Xi is representing but those are not successes I definitely see us out of the country\nHave fallen greatly down on the scale of respect\nAround the world I think supporting an apartheid state in Israel is going to be go down in history as a major ah\nAs a major flaw to what she thinks are her successes I Would love to have seen her really stand up to the president but I don't think she would have maintained her position I Do think she just pandering to whatever her next political goal is\nFreedom thank you so much for your call a ... to ... just let me turn back to you here because you're in a free to their especially talking about a

chocolate party we're talking about UN ambassador Nikki Haley's decision to step down from that post at the end of the year what\nNext for the next UN ambassador and for American foreign policy as a whole and we're joined today by Admiral James to ... he's a former Supreme allied commander at NATO and he's now an operating executive at the Carlyle group and author of the leaders bookshelves\nColum Lynch is also with us he un based senior diplomatic reporter at foreign policy magazine and gentle moved a lot of callers who want to join us let me just get some of them in here one eight hundred and four to three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk who's go to Vivian who's calling from east ... Maine you're on the air Vivian\nOkay thank you for taking my call I I Am an independent voter and I don't belong to the party but I Would like to say that I was so pleasantly surprised by Nikki Haley's\nAttitudes that she took as\nAs a representative to the un she stood up to a lot of the hypocrisy that was shown by the human rights organizations and she stood up to a lot of them are we see that characterize\nIsrael as of right wing country and ah and you know I think it's interesting that Colum Lynch mentioned that she went to the Palestinian\nCamp she went she went to visit the Palestinian areas and maybe what happened was that chased so that they really weren't so bad luck and um that's\nMaybe why she decided to support Israel and moved to Jerusalem\nWill Vivian Vivian let me go let cold respond to your uh your questioner and thank you so much for your call call them what do you say\nI think I think that the characters who isn't true because I mean she went to the to this refugee camp and she came back very moved by the experience\nA and came to testify before Congress and made an passionate personal sort of appeal for them that this these programs really did make life better for them but\nThe alternative was not necessarily be good for U.S interests that you would might the withdrawal of aid might sort of contribute to a promoting the most of the sort of extremist tendencies in the region so I think she was very much I'm\nA moon by that um by that visit 'em what really I think change your view on this was really um the the dispute over the U.S moving um the embassy the U.S embassy to Jerusalem there was a Security Council votes in which um she was a she was you know\nSimply afterwards and I think it was after that this sort of notion that the Palestinians were defying the United states that they were rally international opinion to get to the United states had really kind of shifted her kind of orientation actually became very tough on that issue so I don't I don't think it was about that experience well\nI'm ... I Want to come to you and your thoughts about this but just let me I Want to play a little bit of tape here to offer some contacts this first because at the the ambassador Haley has spoken very forcefully about\nUs support in the Trump administration's support for Israel so first of all this is from march two thousand Eighteen so just a little earlier this year and a basket of Haley was speaking at the annual American Israel public affairs committee conference in Washington received a multiple standing ovations throughout the evening and here's one such moment\nHave sent an organization with a hundred and Ninety three countries\nThe United nations spend half\nAttacking only one country we will not anyhow [noise] that was in March\nOf this year and then to Colum Lynch is point about the UN's response to the United states deciding to move\nA it's a it's ... it's a a embassy to Jerusalem last December the un scheduled a vote on a resolution denouncing that move and ambassador Haley at that time tweeted quote that the U.S we'll be taking names of those who vote against the United states\nThat got some pretty extreme reaction here's former U.S ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns on CNN really criticizing Haley for that\nThis was extremely advised by the Trump Administration by the president in ... I'm kind of surprised that investor hairless during this I don't know she's been ordered to do this but it's not going to be effective you know our our ... were a great country where the leading strongest country in the world and our best presidents are most effective president\nThey lead with self confidence and lead was supporting our allies but there are thousands of votes in the United Nations General assembly and Security Council you win some you lose 'em you can't you can't fully your best friends in the world\nThat's Nicholas Burns us some former U.S ambassador to NATO last December James to read it how do you respond to that\nAgree with Nick burns um and I've worked with neck or on multiple occasions including er during the NATO years he's got a a a pretty ... view of all this now having said that\nGone way over the top in beating up on Israel I'm In Israel is our strongest ally partnering friend in the middle east but um friends need to occasionally speak truth that may be unpleasant we need to at times talked or Israeli friends and\nConvince them to take positions that can help close that gap between Israel and the United nations is frankly not in us interested to have that kind of division between our strongest ally partner and friend in the region that is Israel and the rest of the world so what we ought to be thinking about is\nHow do we close that gap tactically saying things like we're going to take names are is probably not the way to do that in a body like the United nations\nLet's go to a call Colleen is calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air\nHigh I bake a U.S up on a on\nA song and maturation his cabinet or ... ... ... ... you have comments on sea ice sheets the cost of food as her post yeah uh she said her a\nCall and I'm gonna have to jump in on you because your cell phone is a it's breaking up on us it's it's a bit challenging to understand but but James to read if I Know we've got to let you go here so I think we're calling with getting too is that he looks\nAt the president himself as making it a making it more challenging for members of the cabinet to do their job because of the president's position and language on multiple issues on foreign policy and this is something certainly that to the next UN ambassador may face\nAbsolutely and you know exhibit a would be the president's speech in front of the entire world the U.N General assembly where\nHe says I have accomplished more in my two years in any American administration in history and his roundly roundly laughed at um that is not helpful when we go for it than that to me is not a sign of respect um I think that\nOur allies partners and friends are concerned because of our uh the radical behavior in our policy and a ... a good example would be NATO during the campaign President Trump said it was obsolete we're going to get rid of it\nUh then he went over and I was in a series of conversations that we're not\nA particularly productive but at the end of it he did say yes I support NATO I support article five the an attack on one is an attack on all but then subsequently he went back to really excoriated the allies for for spending\nTime he he praises people like Vladimir ... and that is confusing in erratic um when coupled with bombastic statements like he deployed in front of the general assembly that does not do us well in our position in the\nWorld and that he's going to name the next UN ambassador so I just wonder I mean the last question to you James to read it it has Nikki Haley\nActually sort of provided a model of we were talking about this earlier in the show how to both serve the president and this particular administration but but operate in the un in a way that doesn't let 'em you know him or herself be defined by it by the president\nAbsolutely correct and the problem is going to be that there will be countervailing forces who will take a look at Nikki Haley's performance and say I'm you know that's really not what we want we want someone who's more under control who reads the talking points from the White House more closely\nOr he was constantly in lock step and that will be the tension or you know in fantasy land magna", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "10"}
