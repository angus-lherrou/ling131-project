body and this is on point there are several streams of information by which senators can evaluate Brett Kavanaugh fitness to serve on the United States Supreme court\nWe're going to examine two of them today have an actual testimony which will take a look at in a minute and the FBI's new background reports which as in the early hours of the morning is now in the hands of the Senate Judiciary committee the we will start there today and\nJoining me now from Capitol Hill is John brands nanny senior congressional reporter for Politico\nJohn welcome to um point magna so first of all tell us here I think there's a lot of questions around procedure and process now who exactly has uh the FBI's background report on Brett Kavanaugh at the moment\nThe Senate Judiciary committee has a jurisdiction over it so it is in their possession it in a secure facility in the capital and senators and some limited number of staff members can go read the report or be briefed on the report by staff\nI see so I'm I'm seeing here that they're going to sort of rotate between a groups of Democrats and Republicans on each give and give each group or an hour or so to examine the report\nYes and then they will give shepherds staff briefings for them so that the staff will go over the report with them\nOkay a ... and how many copies of the report or they're just as one there\nIs one that they're keeping though you can they they they will allow some members to see copies of it have it a\nCenter them back and forth but it's it's it's right now they're just allowing the one copy there just over one copy that they're keeping ... inside the so called a shift as sensitive compartment complimented information facility is in the basement of the capital\nSo obviously there treat treating this as a highly important document that deserves a secure facility but are there agreements amongst senators and or staffers to maintain the confidentiality of what's in the document I mean we're living in an age where\nWould we be surprised if someone gave a press conference after seeing a seeing the document\nNo they'll be they'll be discussed\nPublic and to respond and there will be for a statements back and forth on it now\nThe specific findings inside the report or confidential they are they are classified so well they're ... national security costs are but they're confidential so it will be improper for somebody to leak does or to put those out there\nA lot I'm sure they'll be discussion broad discussion I mean we know that the FBI has talked to nine interview nine witnesses\nAnd Dr Ford was not one of them Dr ... before she was not one of them they did talk to Deborah Ramirez did not talk to afford which is interesting because she of course testified in\nBut there was the control of those witnesses that was worked out between the White House about who would be interviewed and and Senate Republicans so we know they talked to a nine witnesses we don't know all their identity is at this point\nAh I'm sure that will be probably come out at some point the witnesses themselves can say they were talked about the FBI to will get that information now where we get an actual copy the report I think there'll be some kind of politically redacted version of the report\n\nBoth Ron point comes from W.

stories of transformative learning more and remaking dot education [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're going to spend some time taking a close look at judge Brett Kavanaugh's\nTestimony that he gave before the Senate Judiciary committee last week and asked the question of what that specific testimony said or about his character and whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court now and we're joined by Nathan Robbins and he's editor of the journal current affairs he wrote a long recent piece is titled\nHow we know Kavanaugh is lying that sat on the radio dot org the link to it\nAnd like a green also joined us She's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist at real clear politics she worked with Brett Kavanaugh in the Bush White House for a little over a year and she recently wrote a column titled we can believe Ford and confirm Kavanaugh as well and that link as is also at one point radio dot org\nOkay Nathan so uh you know we we read over your piece and we've actually pulled some of the moments that you referred to a in your article and I just want to go through a couple of them and get your analysis and of course ... response as well\nHere's one moment it's pretty straightforward this is an exchange between judge Kavanaugh and democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and White House is asking cabinet I hear about specific phrases that appeared in judge Kavanaugh's yearbook\nStumbles triangle [noise] drinking game has applied three glasses and a triangle and you're quite quarters gr so quarter scare\nNathan Robbins and why do you highlight this moment\nBecause nobody's ever heard of this drinking game because there was no evidence that the drinking game a existed up until the moment that it came out of Brett Kavanaugh was\nIt's a it's a sexual time and uh in Brett Kavanaugh's testimony he tried to paint himself he tried to the reason this is important because throughout his testimony he tried to paint himself\nAs a kind of innocent and high school he said he was a Virginia but to charge you belong to the soup kitchen he helped intellectually disabled children\nAnd this was all a way of suggesting that essentially Ford's picture of him was crazy\nIt was totally out of touch with the person that he was not devil's triangle is actually a minor one of the examples compared to a lot of the more important one uh like the alcohol and like the just deliberate misstatements about about what other people said\nUm but there is a pattern\nAnd that is one example of a huge pattern in which Brett Kavanaugh invaded admitting what everyone who knew him in high school and college\nSays to be true which is that he was a hard partying hard drinking kind of guy and ... and aggressive and belligerent and he didn't want the Senate to know that and so he didn't admit or any of the things that suggested that he did actually know how to think about sex in high school and uh things that would make for ... more credible\nWell uh you know and just to add a level of I'm intrigued to this just after judge Kavanaugh said what he said about the devil's triangle someone with a congressional IP address went to a ... and actually added judge Kavanaugh's definition of it um that was quickly removed later\nBut but Nathan they'll let me I mean okay so what you just said let me just push you on this a little bit because we also see um I I Know the devil's triangle the minor moment but to me it's very revealing because can't we also see this as a man who is so\nHe has been pushed to such an extreme and it's still cognizant of how hyper partisan this moment is that he ... he ... he is legitimately fearful of even admitting to you know what might I I don't know I'm just what might be like kind of a joke you things that Seventeen year old boy say to each other\nBecause it wouldn't be taken as that it would be taken as an admission for something\nMuch much greater that he's alleged to have done I mean I think\nThe hyper partisanship of the moment may understandably make someone ultra cautious even admitting the slightest thing\nThe problem is that there's a thing called a sworn an oath hand or you take it when he testified in front of the Senate and Brett Kavanaugh as a federal judge and he's seeking to be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nAh so it actually doesn't matter if you find details of your life embarrassing or you think that admitting them would make you look guilty the whole point is that you have to it's a it's sworn testimony you can't lie to the Senate because if you told the truth it would make the allegations against you\nBecause if he admitted the truth I'm it wouldn't help it would hurt him in his attempt to make Christine Ford looked totally out of touch with reality\nAnd it's a green what do you say that I watched his hands because I wanted to know the truth and as I wrote in my piece I Believe both of them I found them both to be telling the truth to be credible now as I look at the evidence I think that it's more likely that the trauma\nAnd P. T. S. D. symptoms that Dr Ford has described are distorting her memory and then it's quite possible that though she may have been assaulted it was not bright Cavanaugh I don't think that the proof shows\nThat it could have been him to prove a and the number of people you have one person saying he was this type of person and then I hear people like a nice in our audience and saying things like nobody's ever heard of a stringing came everybody knew well those are not factual statements\nWe have people on the record under sworn oaths like eighty four women from the Bush White House attest to his character\nSixty five women from high school saying we've known him for thirty five years this is what he was like\nBut I ... that seems to be discounted which bothers me as a person who's really interested in the truth and to me saying statements like nobody's heard of it everybody knew is an example bad faith analysis and in this particular example when I was looking at this piece by an eighth and\nHis examples of why this drinking a meant what he says it means which I find kind of filthy minded honestly\nIs nobody has ever heard of it meaning it's not on the Internet which we didn't have in Nineteen eighty three so it's not on the Internet okay so what DC area kids called uh drinking game devil's triangle which may have just been a circle of friends honestly we I mean who knows I don't have\nThe I I wasn't in the DC area Nineteen eighty three uh but that means he's lying and the additional proof is a nation's friend Pete Davis who went to high school in the DC area\nIn two thousand eight\nThat's not proof and I don't think that is even just crediting I mean I can find a friend to say anything I don't know ... Davis um but I don't think that a friend who graduated in the DC area and two thousand eight who says that\nIn the Internet age devil's triangle now means sustain is evidence that Brett Kavanaugh was lying about this drinking game Nathan I'm going to guess you want to respond to that\nYeah I mean look if anyone can come up with a source for the existence of this being ah the procedure for having us testimony you know having to discuss that I really don't want to dwell too much on this because it is one of the minor things and the most major lives are much much much more significant a light\nOn Thursday July first he attended a gathering with the people that Ford says he attended a gathering with when he said all of the people she says we're there say it didn't happen\nIn fact one of the ... and he's he ... he says Ford's friend Leyland Kaiser\nSays that this didn't happen that's not what my own Kaiser says labeling ... says she believed Dr Ford which means that did happen it was they misrepresented actually it would be awesome if she believes belief does not mean that it did happen just to be what she believes that it did happen yeah which is the opposite of saying that but it didn't happen\nShe believes that it happened right her opinion is the forward is telling the truth\nRight not but it didn't happen and so when Kavanaugh says all of the people she says what they say it didn't happen bats full that's a false statement as a false representation of what those people say when he says he didn't go to a gathering with those people that's false he did we know from his calendar\nOkay so ... and like I'm going to come back to you for a second on this but I just want to play these two moments that Nathan is referring to first of all here is Brett Kavanaugh again before the Senate Judiciary committee last week or in fact in his opening statement saying the calendar that he kept in high school a\nShow that he he says that he never attended a gathering with people that are professor Ford named\nNone of those gatherings recorded a group of people that Dr Ford as far as my calendar show I was very precise about lifting was they're very precise\nAnd then in an exchange with democratic Senator Chris Coons a judge Kavanaugh asserted that are the witnesses who attended the party that professor Ford said the assault happened that they have submitted statements are saying that it didn't happen and here's what judge Kavanaugh said\nI just won the emphasized all four witnesses who were allegedly\nThe event of said it didn't happen\nNow on the green I'm actually we know that what the statements the statements that the witnesses submitted say that they have no recollection\nWhich is categorically different than saying it didn't happen\nTo my question to you is you know were repeatedly told the judge can tell juries that if a if a witness a or a defendant seems I'm a ... ... not credible\n[noise] support for on point comes from exact

Senate Judiciary committee last week and what those words again we're not looking at the past but watch the fed contemporaneously just last week what that says about whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court and\nWe joined today by Nathan Robinson he's editor\nReal clear politics and I just want to play one more moment I mean as many moments we could choose from but let's just play one more moment from last week this is in an exchange with ah that that judge Kavanaugh had with senator Amy ... a Democrat from Minnesota when she asked him to clarify his drinking habits in high school\nWas there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened\nOr part of what happened that night before\nSo I don't know I don't remember what happened and I think you're probably a beer sir um and so\nYou're saying there's never been a case where have you drink so much but you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened\nOr if you're asking about young black I don't I don't know a view\nThat exchange went on and of course those people remember just having a after a break came back and apologize to senator ...\nAnd I agree and I wanted to play that clip and then turn to you because I think that was one of many moments where lots of people including you know what I'm seeing here you know Charlie Sykes a conservative commentator he said in the Weekly Standard pod cast the Astros or on the friday of last week he\nSaid that quote even if you support Brett Kavanaugh there was a ... that was breathtaking as an abandonment of pretense of having judicial temperament and he said it's possible I think to have been angry emotional and passionate without crossing the line that he crossed assuming that there are lines anymore\n... ... what's your response to that I think the fact\nThat he apologized to sign a ... hour shows that he felt that he had come across too aggressive\nThat I'm In the questioning and and he had said you know I Want to apologize I was the first thing that he did when they came back from the break because I have appreciated how you handled your interviews and you know this is a really tough process of sort of you know it it's very hard and I want to apologize I'm sure that that's what I found to be very loudly reconciliation moment\nThat I can show that he was human kids really got to remember coming into this he's coming in and he's kind of damned if he doesn't damned if he doesn't if he's careful with his speech to make sure that he's clear and and I wasn't you know lie under oath which is the last person who's going to want to do that he understands the repercussions and he believes in our justice system\nThen we're going to say well he seems you know on careful or as Nathan Robin said cagey\nUh but if he is colloquial unjust and says something like okay I'm telling the truth about these things that happened and the other people who were there they also say it didn't happen which is the political way of saying I'm telling the truth and none of them have said that I'm lying\nI think this moment showed that he's a human that he felt he got too aggressive he apologized and ah I thought she accepts his apology and it was really nice Nathan your take\nWell what are called colloquial I call false right it just just misrepresenting the facts that but I I think cagey for a reason I mean he us direct questions like I'm so your your book is a got a lot of references to drinking in it and he says I was number one in my class in high school\nWell that that's not an answer to the question right and and the drinking thing people dwell on it like we're trying to impugn his his character by accusing him of drinking it's directly relevant alcohol comes up in all three of the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh\nThat's why it's so important for him to be honest and had to answer those questions directly\nNobody's going to hold it against him if he says look I I really yes it might yes I talked about drinking a lot I was voted you know president of the ... club like uh because I I drank a lot and\nYou know there's nothing wrong with being honest about people understand that you move on and you grow up but he's a Yale classmates your time's talked to a dozen of his your costs money to all say that he's misrepresenting his record of drinking in college\nUm and and and as they say that they say that directly we have his freshman year roommate who said he was a village rent drunk um we have the uh University of Washington I'm head of the uh gone off you know called your department who says I used to drink with Brett ... it's not credible she said it is not a credible for him to say that he had no\nMemory lapses I mean he even said that he'd never woken up with his clothes and different from how he remembered or the night before and that is what he said\nAnd we have people who were there who were participating with him and watched him all say that's just not credible he he he lists finish high school yearbook he's part of the city club that tried to get through a hundred K. eggs in a year\nYou know in market judgments memoir wasted he's ... he's depicted as bart Kavanaugh who feel picked everywhere um and he wouldn't even admit that he was bought a cabinet off\nUm he was asked about that and he said oh you have to ask mark judge will that's fault you wouldn't have to ask mark judge because we know that his nickname in high school was bought that is also in the book\n[laughter] okay let's take a call here Nathan is calling from Milwaukee, Wisconsin you're on your Nathan\nHire a thank you very much for having me I was going to mention I disagree a brick Kavanaugh was lying and I want to say so it was already pointed out was claiming that everybody refuted was when he said people refuted the allegations about him when that wasn't true\nOver the top accusations bought idled sakes the fact that he lied to Congress and she can be lied regardless of whether or not a show you lead regardless of if you believe Dr Ford or not\nI don't think that will stop to Republicans being from Wisconsin I saw Scott Walker lie to Congress back when he was getting a lot of attention from act and none of the Republicans are cared about it or want to do\nAt the end and I don't think they do now\nAnd measuring the group of people supporting cap and all I saw it very ironic that they have the phrase stand with Kavanaugh because it reminds me of the phrase stand with Walker and my experience was that sort of political slogan used to cover up a trustworthy person\nWell about look people there's a hash tag I stand with Christine I mean stand with so and so it seems to be a very very common way of expressing support for whomever it is that you expressed support for NATO and\nI'm okay I'll I'll I'll I'll not that far but we I see a lot of yard signs saying a stand with Walker and like that probably is not trustworthy so when you actually have a science thing that was and was Cavanaugh I'm like oh my gosh and\nSay OK over again Nathan thank you for your call and I said let me turn back to Nathan's broader point is that he doesn't feel that no matter you know whether that no matter the number of pieces of evidence of misstatements that the judge Kavanaugh may have or may not have made I Know there's obviously disagreement over that but\nIn agencies he sees a whole line of misstatements and no matter how long that line is he doesn't think it matters to Congress at all or congressional Republicans and they're going to\nA they're going to confront him anyway and uh he he objects to that but what's your response to Nathan well actually what\nNation is saying is that he sees a line of lives and that's much stronger than misstatements I mean I I as a more trying to see Smith more jak to play I say well maybe he did make misstatements\nUm I don't think that for example he never said he didn't drink in high school he did say yeah I drink and high school sometimes I drink too much sometimes others drank too much that's what that's the way he sat in front of the Judiciary Committee\nAnd in his calendar you know you look at a statement like\nOh well they said that I look at my calendar there's no gatherings like those described\nThere's no gathering that says that leave when Carter was there to office that I don't know him I didn't go to parties with him Dr foreign clearly described a different type of gathering et cetera but like we are talking about what it is to use them going for things that can't be proven from years ago\nAnd I think we even saw this um and and that was last Republicans were trying to sift through this and said\nCircus so they got a prosecutor who has experienced in bringing forth cases of sex crimes she came out with a report which I didn't see mentioned\nUh in in Nathan's piece at all or where she said I found this weaker than a he said she said case based on inconsistencies in her testimony so I think it's important to be fair saying look\nYou can find inconsistencies like people are human they are talking about things for the best of their recollection and when you're being questioned in front of every chairman of the nation of before a panel senators whether your Christine forward or Iraq having all that as an intimidating\nPlace to be in and I think really when we come down to is if he's telling the truth\nIs does he deserved to have his life destroyed over it does he deserved to have all the people numerous people he has one freshman roommate saying oh X Y Z about his character than he has", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "04"}
