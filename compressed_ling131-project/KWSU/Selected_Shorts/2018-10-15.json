John ... pro rock climbing pro the freest of the three the greatest brain to pay [noise] travel the world climate harder than most exotic [noise]\nTwo thousand north space sponsored the for them to climb in the mountains of\nKurdistan to scale famous yellow [noise]\n\nThis location in Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers\nEspecially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year as you say hey let's say a destination yes\n[noise] the climate for you to massive peaks and dangerous clips faces but still as their helicopter descended into the ... valley and the yellow walking into view they were blown away\nProbably would impacted us that we weren't ready for with me the scale ally is just how much bigger than mountains are then everything we have over here at first it was a little bit difficult to wrap our heads around\nThat's Jason Smith he put the whole expedition together and what the de facto leader of the group that was John the photographer [noise] that the world class and only female climber group and her boyfriend Tommy was the youngest of before for Tony the other well first they could climb [noise]\nHe hasn't tend to grab my hand\nAnd I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if he didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to\nGet out and ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliant\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me his rifle\nI was like well that's even better [noise]\nWhich I took his rifle and I turned around and I have very intently gave it to John and I said sure John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind starting to shift and I grabbed old hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy\nAnd smiling from Erie patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padding among the switch shoulder and they're like little dog like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their causes and we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to do all asking what the story was here and up to try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story with that that we understood\nWas that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they praying they mind their own business but there is this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really bad guy elected absolve president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to release study their religion and\nThe men were from Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time\nState and a handful of my friends went to a group with specific demand like the captors\nAnd you can find a John that we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss and he got on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on ... and then south ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure that Jason still believes that they could not count on rent from a rescue their best shot at living with skate by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned that John that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of that and um [noise] my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember back to myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as as an evil and you might think even though we are seeing them murder somebody I very much saw them as victims circumstances whether specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at him and be like who's to say that I wouldn't be right there and his name in it you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashed in their schools are\nStabbed their next with Dick gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about ... some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like this you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats and I'm going to jump on this guy and just ... just teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better steak or raw and um\nYeah I was in many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody and others\n[noise] Mm\nGotten to for climate they walked and walked for a whole night investing for a day and then did again they did\nThis for three days starving and I came up with this really good game to play pass the time [noise]\nUm where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nYou start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and\nWhere you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again and then finally one of his broken apps what time it was when we took gases and it turns out it and then five minutes [noise] and I think that's probably one Tommy changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I\nMean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering on your teeth were super sore from chattering all the time but it just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than a bill hungry sleep deprived men they get off the communicate their plans with each other openly and wrong as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nDo seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your Base Camp and [noise] I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nTo one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and not one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of weird way and we're like we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come out of me to [noise] and then we were all going to go together it's summer there was saying\nAnd and obviously man bought the story that I spend a week selling to us just bought a hook line and sinker [noise] so I grabbed his arm and begged him to not only served pleading with him not to go\nIn danger is out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he would have to tear himself away from us we were all grabbing human begging him to knock out he he had this looks like he's like no I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off they split\nUp dual tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew lets\nSo like my rib cage was going to explode there just isn't\nBall and excitement because it was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy has got to Don's an anger named the knife and here it was like all of that and you have like one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate they basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on this sort of training especially since it was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately [noise]\n\nCommunicated to each other that it was game on and this was going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the\nMountain they gather and I'm always trying to find [noise] uh I'm trying\nAll that kind of direct to away that looks like the easiest way to also puts them in the danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nWhen you could tell that they were there were like this is a moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then and then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with bad and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something\nAnd I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything to them and we'll be morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chances of survival [noise]\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and was raised in the class and it just\nSort of scrambled up over behind him and he wasn't expecting it at all Mm\nBut as I was reaching out to grab his gun strapped sense what was going to happen and he turned towards me up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping I pulled as hard as I could and he just toppled over backwards\nAnd he just kind of what this park through them and like any turn and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact the whole way down\nAnd ... he hit the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and his whole body let us really horrible\nCracking sound is really loud and then he ... and the darkness\nAnd I sat down and I just\nYou know right after that and she sort of sat behind me and wrap your arms around me and just tried to come from and I was like trembling and I remember I remember ... you know for some reason in that moment I just needed her approval so much throughout this whole thing um\nI like that I can just go out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to like look ahead cranks revolving just felt like one two one two or something like that you kinda\nDo you tell one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old Spencer started getting headache to very terrible headache and he was diagnosed with an al formation in his brain [noise]\nI mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain now promotions because he was crazy\nSpencer Institute brain now formation had nothing to do with one another [noise] but it's been through brain situation didn't seem like a needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the church or it could cause more problems than it would result [noise]\nAnd this was about the time when it's been two became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointment and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery no matter what [noise]\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone [noise] or you know I'm without it then but\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to ten how strongly did you feel this way out so it's like I say it was about eight and do you remember what you might have been scared of\nI'm just not coming out on the surgery as a totally different person I think is what I was scared of\nA different person center was scared his personality which which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes\nPeople experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous like there's a story about playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture for is the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patients who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever\nIt was that made him Spencer he was worried that if you change to the brain you changed him\n[noise] so I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything will come on better from it made him very hasn't then there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too risky surgery innocent\n[noise] there was a conversation I had with him at some point [noise] expressing from my regret [noise] about my own surgery because I still [noise] have symptoms even after the second surgery [noise] almost every day [noise] time [noise]\nMinute to him nuts [noise] one of my biggest regret the surgeries on my surgery and that's not [noise] it's made me a [noise] somewhat better person at times [noise]\nUm [noise]\nCan I get a little skeptical about the old ways you can try [noise] okay [noise] um [noise] so in like ... story with Amy I'm been in\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so and I'm Wondering if that didn't turn by her brain or something like physical and I went to\nMy only problem in line the intersection of all of those things are more than [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly somebody to set a goal to their real expensive having severe headache it again and he ended up in the ER engineer he was a helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I was just talking butter chip rush and shortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that sort of his bad holding hands and feet down while the nurses tried to restarted ivy\nAnd there for a few minutes as I watched him try to catch his breath I I I thought we would listen\nAnd was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and got to spend ... hospital room in the new [noise] he's um [noise]\nIn a coma and the condition that I Am hopeful only I Would have to have dealt with [noise] and [noise] I Wish I could have been union
