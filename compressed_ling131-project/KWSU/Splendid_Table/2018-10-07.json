with the topic and he started asking people about it directly that generally unless this size and grown and comments that sounded a little like that\nI feel serious about it that's all I can describe it as it's just pure theory\nI feel very um\nI feel angry you feel a little bit on patients\nUh it's really stressful I\nAm initially angry and then I settle in and say turn of the tunes get spotted by going in just relax it's either that or take advantage and I don't have a prescription yet from\nThose were commuters we tracked down in Atlanta and Chicago and they're talking of course about traffic something that affects the health mental state wallets family life and worked options of so many Americans\nWhich kind of makes you wonder could traffic be fixed or is it just destined to trap it's in our cars for more and more times each year\nThere's general agreement the congestion in our major urban areas is getting worse\nMichael ... is an associate professor of urban planning at UCLA Luskin school of public affairs his focus is traffic and he said if you live in or near a major urban area you probably spend a chunk of your day in gridlock\nLos Angeles New York Washington DC that metropolitan area San Francisco Boston Chicago Atlanta\nIn general the bigger and denser city you are the more traffic congestion your roads have\nRush hours have expanded as we try to avoid driving at the worst times a day stresses grown as people grapple with the unpredictability of traffic that when they could take thirty minutes to get to work in the next day takes fifty and that caught donut they're\nOne of the most under appreciated impacts of traffic congestion is the pollution that results from it when vehicles are idling moving slowly are just going stop and go around ten to Fifteen miles an hour they admit much more pollution\nAdmit more carbon and which is sort of matters for climate change and sort of global concerns but at a local level they're likely to them that much more sort of what we called local mission\nStrongly associated with increases an asthma increase in other respiratory diseases or increases and cancer and most especially increases in a premature birth and low birth weight\nThose costs Mandela said are mostly born by people who come between five hundred thousand feet from the congested road which means that not all of the costs associated with traffic are paid by people who drive a lot\nOf the drivers who suffer from last time it's the drivers who suffer from stress it's the drivers who suffer from most crashes but you also have people who just live near freeways and those folks tend to be a much lower income than the population at large and they breathe a very polluted air\nTruly man has spent some serious energy thinking about how you make traffic better noticeably better now politicians also say they want to make traffic better but man don't argue they've tended to embrace solutions that the evidence doesn't quite barren out\nCertainly the most long standing approach to fighting traffic congestion has been to build more roads right in that could be building entire roads which we don't do very much any more\nOr it could be widening existing roads which was very very popular in sort of the last decades and the twentieth century and we still do some of much more in some parts of the country than others but like you know\nWhere they take money paid by folks who can afford it and use it to help subsidize access to the goods for people who have less money there's absolutely no reason that we couldn't do the same thing with congestive prices\nHow do you know at work and where has it been tried in like where can I go to see them\nOkay so I think there's two ways to think about this one is that if you just think conceptually about what traffic congestion is\nThen you you understand the pricing is the only thing that solve that problem so again if you understand the congestion results because of very valuable asset is under priced and so as a result too many people want to use it at a particular time\nThan just logically the only thing that is going to ruin ameliorate that is making it more expensive at that time [noise] so that's like sort of just the the logical or conceptual basis behind it if you want to see it in action Singapore has used some version of congestion pricing\nSince Nineteen Seventy five I Believe well and it has used sort of more sophisticated electronic wrote pricing since the late Nineteen nineties early to thousands a Singapore is a very dense city it's denser than San Francisco\nIt's freeways move pretty consistently at fifty five or sixty miles an hour oh you can also see examples of this along certain\nWhat we call high occupancy toll lanes throughout the United states that's our Ninety One roadway in in orange county for instance there's a great example it's a congestion priced roadway that sits in the middle of a free freeway in orange county okay and during rush hour\nAnd the price planes a variant of congestion pricing is it at work in places like London and stuck home where driving into the center of the city and this is not freeways but this is driving into the downtown you encourage charged to do so\nOr that it's been very successful as well the first day of London's congestion charging traffic delay went down by about thirty five percent\n[noise] so this is an issue that crosses party lines it's not part isn't isn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican if you're you know stuck in traffic every morning\nOn but I have not heard a lot of politicians talk about it do you see we've kind of a local thing but do you see mayors are governors I'm Talking about this doing congestion pricing really trying to make people can use a better\nSo congestion is absolutely a much bigger priority at the local and sometimes the state level than it is it's a national level right it's not something that the national government has a lot of concern or authority over\nAnd it's also just not something that even if you look at polls you know if you ask them to American in a Gallup poll or something like this congestion bad they say yes mhm but if you ask them like name the top three problems in your region\nOnly and a handful of regions does congestion rank really high so I think it it becomes much more an issue that mayors and city council members are and in smaller states like Massachusetts governors tackle\nAnd the question of you know\nDo I see these elected officials embracing congestion pricing what I Would say optimistically is that more people are willing to talk about it now than they were ten years ago I think it's a hard political cell I mean this is people are very accustomed to the roads being free\nThey're also very accustomed unfortunately policymakers having told them to other things would solve congestion being told that because we're building transit or adding road past city\nThe problem was going to get better so I think it's been difficult to sort of go back on that and say actually we were wrong the only thing that's going to solve this has pricing [noise]\nBut I I'm optimistic that as more and more places many of them outside the United states uh experiment with this mayors in the United states will look around and say you know [noise] there's no reason we shouldn't be part of the success [noise]\nMandela associate professor of urban planning at the UCLA unless in school of public affairs his research focuses on\nNo no no no way\nThey no longer than anything that\nYou heard from some commuters in Atlanta and Chicago at the beginning of the segment what we ask those folks who in the world will look like without traffic\nI could not imagine all jobs are we talking\nAbout the Tesla a super underground tunnels train because bring it on although it seems kind of jets and to me I cannot imagine a world without try and\nBe a good question I probably more people to the nearby live out there if they didn't have to deal with Ofeibea commute\nWow Chicago would be absolutely amazing I I Love the city but it's so hard for a really frustrating [noise]\nFeel like that would be a real life\nAnd so\nWe've got lots more about Mandela's idea congestion pricing how it works places where it's been tried that the innovation hub\nMean there's an obvious way to really make a blue collar jobs and everyone would get a bigger piece of the ...\nThe idea generally that everybody's collectively shaping the former governor station that we should all
