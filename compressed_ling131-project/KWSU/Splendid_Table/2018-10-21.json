Abigail Roberts in what she was only six team in the poster came out with an advertisement for flowers to use her baking which seems like just about the most innocuous thing in the world ... was in\nThe year was Nineteen oh too and what Roberts and saw\nHorrified her she saw herself she ... she had posed for in a photography studio which the our manufacturer Franklin mill\nHad somehow gotten

technologies and late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds that me people feel like privacy was being stolen from them technologies like photography particularly instance ... graffiti and mass media\nAnd if you can believe it postcards\nWhen postcards came on board of course anyone could read the back of a postcard from the mail carrier to a nosy neighbor and so there's this you know small but I think very interesting and telling her full or around the etiquette of postcard writing that people shouldn't be selling their secrets um these cards\nThe rise of telephones also seemed to many in the public like a serious violation of privacy\nTelephone operators wiretap birds of various sorts party lines in um domestic telephone communications\nAll of these meant that people were communicating with each other about private matter but that a whole bunch of people could potentially at any point be listening in on the same was true for the telegraph in terms of communications ever tell us\nSarah ... new book is the knowns and it's been a history of privacy in modern America\nAnd she argues that the story of privacy isn't linear we didn't have a whole bunch of privacy and some previous era that we continue to lose piece by piece\nWhat we want what we demand what we hope for it keeps changing which brings us back to Abigail Robertson the girl who was shocked to see herself on the flower poster\nRobertson one her case in court but when she got to the state level on appeal she lost her last enraged the public\nThe chief judge ... and Parker said there was no quote so called writer privacy\nParker was pilloried but he went on to run for president against Theodore Roosevelt and if you've never heard of ... and Parker well you know what happened in that election then us meanwhile kept grappling with new inventions and ideas that required\nOften compromises in our privacy\nSocial Security numbers were one of those that that I think Americans really weighed and made a trade off about that this number which\nDid allow the government to track ones earnings and employment history and sometimes health history as well that that it was worth it to have economic security and so in the Nineteen thirties there are certainly debates about this number of the Social Security number and we all know and maybe love and there are lots of debates about it but\nIn the end Americans are are pretty willing to have that number in exchange for economic rights and economic security\nBy the Nineteen sixties and seventies the nature of debates about privacy we're changing in some ways people are growing more open which we will get to\nYour personal details unless you very carefully and deliberately opted out and that really reversed as Danah boyd who's written about this really nicely that really reverse a tradition where it was actually hard to get information that was hard to get information out and to circulate it it flip flop that\nSo that that was a hugely important part of the Internet and the way that it's intersected with privacy debates and also of course gave Americans who have long um many long wanted an audience of some kinds right and a kind of influence and reach\nExactly that gave them a platform for their blogs for their\nThoughts for you know sharing their photographs of their meals\nYou know giving allowing their friends to see their movements it allowed people to do what they've been doing since the days of the postcard which is you know share information about themselves and and so those those too fast but um again have come together and really powerful ways in the\nUh ability of now many many many people to look into and use that information in ways that we're not always intended of course by the people who put it out there to begin with\n[laughter] let me just take a step out of history here for a minute ... will step back into it for a minute\nYou know your last summer with the with uh the telephone people can listen in the calls and the telegraph and then the Internet and you know and closed circuit TV cameras all over city it and you just keep going and people know more and more about you\nBut in some sense if I if you think back to like medieval in London or something people living very close together walls being not very thick you can just hear what people are saying on the other side you know or people living in very small villages in small communities where everybody knows everybody and everybody knows everybody's business\nIn some ways like tomorrow if I walked through Rio or Beijing or like New York city but he would know who I was I mean I can walk through anonymously and\nMaybe privately I mean in some ways I feel like you could argue that we maybe have more privacy then we had hundreds of years ago [noise]\nAbsolutely I think this is what has missed off in in our contemporary debate this idea that the privacy of some ... some quantity that was there once and is now gone and eroding slipping for our fingers but no it's true that we live privately more privately in many ways than did people a couple of centuries ago\nIn terms of a White House construction ways that neighborhoods are designed to homes are designed but also in terms of our very writes in our sensibilities sense of what should be private\nUm has changed and so it I\nThink it's really a mistake to think about privacy its own moving in one direction um this is what makes it hard to chart and hard to kind of place in any given point but it's it's the exact and in certain ways even though perhaps we have less privacy in our communications today or around our personal information say um it's accessibility to others\nWe have more privacy I think some ways in a way we live in a way it's we think about ourselves as private up people who ought not to have the state or neighbors peering in through our windows all the time [noise]\nSo what's your diagnosis of where we are now are we in like a lot less private than we were a hundred years ago\nDon't think so but I Do think that the substance of our privacy in our ideas about privacy rights have changed and changed in conjunction with all kinds of things technological development state developments a commercial or and so on architectural event\nI think if I were to describe our current moment I think what we're experiencing are two different trajectory is coming together and have created a lot of problems I'm One of them is the ability for\nThis uh impetus are that many citizens have had since the Nineteen seventies to disclose more of their authentic sells on different kinds of media platforms those are coming together in ways that are I think I'm more unanticipated and which have meant that there is a ton of information out there about us\nSome of it uh kept by record keepers some of it disclosed voluntarily by us um and and then we've got we're in this technological and commercial moment where all of that as valuable to others\nAnd there are many many ways to harness it so those two things have come together they didn't they didn't necessarily have to come together but they have and I think that explains are a scandal late in the moment you know firm Equifax to Cambridge Analytica and whatever is next\nTo Sara I go is the author of the known citizen history of privacy in modern American she's also an

Jeff Williams\nLand no matter how dry Texas got ... the state Supreme Court had told them\nAnd what it basically comes down to is that an individual landowner has the right to\nLiterally pull up as much water as they possibly can as long as it's used for quote more or less beneficial purposes and that's the end of it boils down to whoever has the biggest pump wins in the Williams is fed among the the bigger pumps\nMcGraw is the author of a Thursday land the making of an American water crisis he said that what Jeff Williams could not do by law we ship the water to other people who needed it\nEven when drought began to plague Texas in two thousand ten and even when that drought what's forcing some farmers to abandon their crops Jeff Williams thought the situation was curious to say the least\nHe reads the newspaper that well you know what forty thousand hackers are rice or being let go I'm a I'm a far you know what I'm going to do I'm going to raise rice in the district now to be fair it was only a small part it was only a few acres was a\nTest plot [laughter] it was more to make a point but it was to actually make a profit\nThe point was that despite the fact that race is generally grown and places like Southeast Asia were among the ones that are the landscape with rain the Williams's could grow rice in the desert\nIn the middle of a drought McGraw argues tells us I'm mocked about where we're headed with water not just in Texas but in the country as a whole\nYou have the abdication of a federal to the state the abdication of the state to the local and ultimately the abdication of the local to the individual and that becomes I think that's a powerful challenge and\nHow Texas response to this challenge is instructive for how the rest of us are going to respond to the challenges for\nWhat we're facing as a nation increasingly played by both lack of water droughts forest fires and too much water much of it unsafe for contaminated up until now water has been a classic government versus the individual struggle in America\nPolitics by another name but it can't stay that way McGraw said when we're struggling to find enough water for people in lots of American cities Las Vegas Los Angeles Phoenix\nSomething's got to get into it for him most clearly\nMuch of the southwest for example when they first became part of the United states they were very sparsely populated ... they were very sparsely populated because they could support very sparse population\nAnd technology it seems to me it's hard to imagine a Phoenix before air conditioning for example I mean the Phoenix up today\nThere could be new Phoenix before before air conditioning there could be no El Paso there could be no there could be no San Antonio today\nWere it not for the technological advancements that have taken place and particularly took place in the post war era too\nSo the implication is here that we put too many people um or that they put themselves in the Las Vegas is in the Phoenix is in the past those certainly given the amount of water that we have and those places and\nI I I'll just say on behalf of those people like white I mean these are major areas of economic importance and cultural important are you saying in Thirty years they're going to turn on the tap and water is not going to come out\nNow here's here's what I'm saying I'm not saying that you know you're going to turn on the tap and and and ... and nothing comes out the sand shark that is certainly one possibility but I think it's an unlikely possibility\nThe problem isn't necessarily that there isn't enough water in Texas is that there isn't enough water in Texas where\nThe population centers are this is true elsewhere in the United states we can rise to that challenge but it's going to require that sort of top down view the other thing that it's going to require is the recognition that all water is not created equal [noise]\nThe average American consumes in all forms are probably about a hundred and thirty five gallons of water a day OK okay somewhere in the vicinity of that [noise]\nOh that about ten percent actually ... their body and yet the vast majority of water than Americans touch is treated to drinking water ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "city": "Pullman", "day": "21"}
