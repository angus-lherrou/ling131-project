promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health and Americans for the arts [noise]\nInnovation and carry on but\nThere are all sorts of little things that can sway an election\nActually election that's close\nIn two thousand Fifteen late shift in three states that often vote democratic Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania turned out to be especially important in Hindi Donald Trump an electoral college victory\nIn Oxford University study found that those three states we would have voted for Hillary Clinton if there he was a robot had been just two percent slower\nAnd if it happens she'd be the president this week we'll talk to folks who don't agree at all as to whether the problem with the economy and all the political fallout that it's caused its technology or whether the real problem is us\nFirst up Bryan Zander has chronicled has several swing states have had the effect of completely shifting or politics\nFrom Obama to Trump to whatever comes next he's the author of glass house the one percent economy and the shattering of an all American town and he recently wrote about automation and the MIT tech review Bryan welcome\nThank you it's a great pleasure to be here [noise]\nSo your book came out in two thousand Seventeen after the two thousands sixteen election but you continue to report this story particularly focusing on Ohio which is where you're from and obviously we're right up against another election right now\nWhat's your sense of whether anything has changed in the last couple of years ...\nI I mean I think some attitudes have changed somewhat I think a speaking specifically about Donald Trump I think there is some chagrin among some people who voted for Trump in states like Ohio who are not pleased with his behavior\nOn the other hand I think there is a reluctance\nTo sort of admit to that because so many\nPeople you know who are very broadly generalize over generalized was the the so called elite or the coastal elites or whatever have been telling people that they made a huge mistake and so there's there's there's the big reluctance to admit they made a mistake it's sort of like when you've been swindled nobody wants to\nAgainst people who are doing well you know often there's this mocking among some of my colleagues frankly about the you know they talk about oh an economic and security wink wink nudge nudge when it was really racism or something else\nThe fact is it's not just economic and security it's insecurity about everything it's a cultural insecurities gets insecurity about money and politics and where they stand in the world now\nUh the ground has shifted under their feet that feeling is still there in these places and in fact might be stronger than ever\nAnd you write about a study that estimated that close to seven hundred thousand jobs um I had been lost automation between Nineteen sixty seven in two thousand fourteen do people feel like Donald Trump is addressing that situation and the way that maybe they hoped\nNo not not specifically automation automation is part of a mix of this general shifting that I just described I don't think that they think that Donald Trump is going to be able to do much about that in fact they regard the coming of automation and artificial intelligence and other buzzwords that they've heard about as\nAs inevitable as the sunrise okay and there was nothing to be done about it\nIt's interesting that they have bought into this idea that whatever technologists and Silicon Valley says there's going to happen will in fact happened and it's going to mean bad things for them they don't know what exactly bad things but it's going to mean bad things and they see this on the line\nThere is a chance of rain tonight on the ... and in

B. dot org [noise] [noise]\n[noise] innovation hub on Karen Miller [noise]\nA teacher that work you do may not be\nThat different from the work the teacher did Seventy years ago at least in the sense that you work in a classroom and there are students that's also true in many ways for doctors and mail carriers and waiters\nBut it isn't true for people who drive for ... for who do odds and ends assigned to them by the website TaskRabbit or who delivered to seek out to get ordered on rubs [noise] so what the dividing line between the jobs that have said surely steady and knows that are new on the scene\nAmerican business a lot of the idea of freelancing for a long time not just in this era of Internet startups in very low unemployment rate and the shift in the economy to we're seeing that tack it's about us and the choices we make\nLewis timing is an associate professor of economic history at Cornell University he's the author of temp hell American work American business in the American dream became temporary\nLewis thanks for your time so real pleasure to be here thank you so when you hear people say things and I'm sure this comes across say you're ... death every now and again but he was saying you know like\nShe because of the Internet you know so much work is now ... to get there and there's not that much security there's so much freelancing [noise]\nWhat do you think when you hear that kind of complaint\nIt's really interesting to me because there's a way in which technology acquires sort of an air of inevitability that there's nothing that can be done this is just the future it's algorithms and futuristic robots and in the book I really pushed back against us pretty strongly\nThat technology is neutral it solves business problems tech doesn't drive change a consolidated\nAnd things that you think happened in the last few years that are being driven by apps are really the byproduct of you know the rise of a certain kind of service economy that has been insecure increasingly insecure and unequal for quite some time\nAnd so when you when you say then I guess that technology has always driven things I mean I think people think like\nTechnology and the reason we had the industrial revolution right that if the ... you hadn't had automatic looms then that never would have happened in that the Internet is like I said you know the reason at all this temporary work has happened you just sort of don't buy that argument\n[noise] I don't I don't think many historians do either it's really important to realize and it's and it's a story we're told so there's a reason why people think it's not just because they're you know confused at ... this is the story we're told that the story of progress to the story of technology you know the cotton gin and the steam mentioned in the railroad\nBut before all that was made possible there was a social reorganization of people are from their homes into the factories and the historians called the industrial revolution which preceded the industrial revolution by about a hundred years the ... revolution the in dust tree is Rob a bank\nRooms together and supervised and you know they were weaving textiles they were you know making pots pottery and it had nothing to do with technology you had to do with simply\nOrganizing people in a row and watching them this is where Adam Smith famous example of pin manufacturing came from right it wasn't\nYou know the idea of division of labor that you know one person could make you know fewer I tend to make a PIN we could make like three pin I could make zero pins I'm not\nVery good I mean you know that but let's see what we are doing\nExactly but if you sit down thirty people and you break down the process and separate steps suddenly oh maybe I can I can definitely hit something in a certain way again and again and again\nAnd that these Skilling of work that division of labor this is the foundation of capitalism and a lot of ways it's one of the foundations of capitalism\nAnd this is what we're seeing today that the corporations fundamentally was reorganized sometime or between Nineteen Seventy Nineteen eighty in a new way that created more insecure lives for the rest of us and ... is the waste product of that service economy it's the\nIt's only possible because the rest of our work lives at Starbucks and Wal Mart are so bad\nIf what you're saying is in some fans factories were created before the kinds of factories we think about where so many things are automatic and electric powered talk about and\nHow the gig economy was there before even before the Internet forget Hoover and the Internet ever came on but it was really there before\nAbsolutely so in the book I talk about temp jobs and by temp jobs I mean jobs that are\nLoosely affiliated with a corporation or a workplace and you can see them and all kinds of ways from consultants which are well paid to temps which are run through an agency to migrant laborers\nOr which are pretty much shut out of any kind of legal protections or workplace rights so distorted really begins after World War two when the first temp agency has come into being when the first\nConsulting fees really comes with the foreground so here I'm Talking about manpower incorporated as the for for runner the temp agency and McKinsey and company as a foreigner of consultants and of course at the same time the ... program which brought guest workers from Mexico to the U.S for the very first time\nTackled that about man power ... which is still going strong it's a company that he just\nTalking about like the guy you started and what we're hoping to do in sort of how we ended up changing America\nSo all these different kinds of temp work really whereabouts supporting that post war corporation that was focused on security focused on stability and long term jobs\nAnd so the founder of manpower incorporated Elmer winter was a lawyer in Milwaukee and one day he had a crisis where he needed a secretary to type up some legal nuts\nAnd he didn't have one so he\nCalled around you couldn't find somebody he realized that this was not a problem this was an opportunity like so many entrepreneurs\nAnd so he spouted manpower as a way to supply emergency replacement labor for business executives and for our companies and this was a tremendous growth business they exploded through the Nineteen fifties\nBy the Nineteen end of the Nineteen fifties he realized there was a limit to how often secretaries got sick or you know people went on vacation and you begin to imagine a different kind of workforce of workforce that could come in at needed that can be a permanent like temporary workforce\nAnd yet people didn't do it and they didn't do it because of the reasons they didn't have the experience with it they trust of the people that they knew and they didn't quite believe that that was the purpose of the company the purpose of the company was to provide security to provide long term investments and all the things that are missing in the meaning of the corporation today\nSo then how did he headed manpower convinced corporations to take that next step not just you know replace somebody while they were having surgery or like you said like went on vacation but um you know gee I'm One\nOf the work place or a lot of the people who work you know with you interchangeable you don't have to like make a full time commitment to them\nWhat happened was\nThe first that there was something called the computer that became really important in the mid Nineteen sixties especially the system three sixty by IBM and corporations were entranced by it they were entranced by this idea of losing all their paper records to ditch for records\nAnd or other I guess analog since it was magnetic tape but it is is is the sequester the huge amount of work and so they look to manpower to make that transition and they hired you know shifting ships and shift\nJust take something that's important to us and then just hire manpower to do it and they had this experience with outsourcing for the very first time something that was court to their own business so this is an experience that lots of corporations are having the late Nineteen sixties\nAnd then comes a huge crisis in Nineteen sixty nine an intellectual crisis\nListening to innovation had [noise]\nIf you would like to see a list of all the shows on the station and when you can hear them is it N. W. P. B. dot org hover over the radio top than click schedules [noise]\nInnovation and turn them you know we've been rushing headlong into a technological future I mean I guess you could make the argument we been doing it ever since the industrial revolution started but by the specially accelerate seems to me the late Nineteen seventies and the early eighties\nThat's author Brian Alexander who I talked to earlier in the show about how much new technology like automation and robotics has ended jobs and community especially in places like Ohio where he grew up\nAnd at first it seemed like great promise and there have obviously been many benefits of all of this technological change but I think one of the very destructive parts of it has been that it has contributed to this erosion of community\nThat erosion Alexander says it's been particularly powerful ... teach where factories have substituted robots for people and were solid blue collar jobs now feel scarce but for those who are part of building the technology that drives our lives these sorts of changes have been going on for well ever\nIn the early eighties the job of being a switchboard operator was on its way out\nDaniel Theobald cofounded the robotics company back now and he now serves as chief innovation officer\nI think in Nineteen eighty four eighty and she had forty thousand switchboard operators today you know a handful at most and nobody really but I Know if it's really lamenting the loss of the ability to sit behind a desk and plug wires in and out of the switchboard all day long it wasn't great work\nBut the other side of the equation is really interesting for me at least and that is if you were to try and handle today's communications using switchboard operators it would take many many times the population of the entire earth\nTechnologies the about argued changed they always have people who made their living constructing horse drawn carriage Ajmi drafted to order who had chops at a time when men and women thought it was a dignified to go out\nThat time you know we have one point seven seven six trillion dollars of our India investment globally Seventy five percent of that is outside of the United states [noise] Ninety percent of all the science and scientists and engineers who ever lived are alive today\nFormer deputy assistant secretary of defense for research Melissa flags says that even if America wanted to stop the advance of the sorts of technologies that can lead to fewer workers and car manufacturing plants we couldn't really the economy is too cold lived this\nTime that that were harkening back to doesn't exist\nAnd so the question isn't\nOh we've rushed into it the world has already gone there and in order for us to think about fundamentally improving the lives of the next several generations\nWe have to actually ask them to help us figure out how do you transform or or build totally new types of communities I Do think we're going to have to accept that\nAs new things are created some things that we remember when the styles are will no longer exists\nFlag is now the northeast region lead at the U.S army research laboratory and she and Daniel Theobald who started the robotics company\nAgree that the march of technology offers incredible potential for making our lives better but in the short term they say our responsibility to pay a lot more attention to people who have been displaced\nYou know when that when the person who's been working a certain type of job almost all of their life feels threatened that the world is going to change because of technology that's a real issue and that's a real hard issue to deal with\nSo uh you know we need to do a better job in this country of taking care of those people have training workers of retraining workers of having continuing education but to to blame the robots ultimately is counterproductive because we will end up in a place where we can't take care of the exact people that that we're trying to protect\n[noise] do you feel like I mean you spent I think pretty much your entire adult life making robots does it feel strange when you hear all this sort of coverage in politics in the media about automation and and\nYou know people feeling really alienated and upset because of sort of what technology in robotics doing does it feel weird to be a person who creates robots\nYeah it does you know one thing that to is really important for me throughout\nDo you make life better for people that's got to be the primary focus and I believe very strongly that technology can do that and by and large technology has done that all the way back to the stone age\n[noise] um most uh uh I Know you grow up in Missouri and your family had and actually had now a a cotton farming Arkansas talk about what you see not in Silicon valley not maybe in Boston or New York up but they're\nSo my hometown Sykes and trucking is the main industry there so there's a lot of conversation that I've had with folks who I Know who live in like Stan and their thoughts about listening to conversations about automation\nAnd they're scared and an angry that people talk about it like it's exciting rather than talking about the impact\nWhen I go to the farm the flip side is it's allowed small farm to continue to exist and to actually make enough money to be relevant for families in ways that we couldn't have otherwise because having precision grading and no till farming and\nQuite frankly Roundup Ready cotton and things like this that have allowed us to do farming with fewer people right I mean those\nTractors are basically robots that have satellite precision you know place the input here and so it's kind of incredible to see both sides of it where it's really enabled individual families to farm in a way that they could never have done and it's increased the yield of this land\nBy just tremendous amounts\nOn the other side right you you see people losing jobs and so I think when you start to have those conversations across communities in the same town it's really exciting because then you start to see these debates between people who really trust each other\nAnd that's an intriguing again it's it's not having the technologist in charge of the conversation is tricky and you learn in D O D because\nSingle thing that a soldier or an airman or a sailor and marine uses the ship a jet to write\nA submarine thirties incredible pieces of technology but these are kids that came out of my home town right and we've trained them to be in this universe incredibly high tech\nAnd so there are these incredible translators between hey you know it can enable you and you can use it in an amazing ways and you don't have to be a PHD computer scientist to do\nStation officer of ... robotics and must have fled the north east region only eat at the U.S army research lab Danielle let's talk about another strand of this conversation uh which I think probably doesn't get talked a lot about 'em in in most media because we're very busy having the jobs in technology conversation\nBut I Wonder how much people in technology worry um that the U.S and maybe because of some of these concerns is falling behind in the world in terms of robotics and automation or are you know are we doing great and don't worry about it\nYou know because we have a very high standard of living here and because you know where several generations in from significant events in the world like World War two et cetera\nWe sometimes forget that the prosperity we have here in the U.S was hard fought it wasn't something that just magically happened because you know Americans are the smartest people in the world that's not the case at all and it's a matter of fact\nI'm you know we need to think about the larger global community and helping everybody do well but there are a lot of economists out there that are highly highly motivated to win to improve their standard of living to invest heavily in robotics and technology because what they realize there's\nWhoever owns that technology at the end of the day is going to have a leg up on every other region in the world\n... ... do you share those concerns do you worry that the U.S is falling behind when it comes to sort of creating cutting edge technology so\nEveryone wants me to say I agree I I feel really contrarian about this the amount of funding going into research and development around the world is so big", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "28"}
