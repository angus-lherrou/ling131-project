[noise] families so that the ah [noise] ah Nazis I guess march and everybody down into a ditch and blowing them away [noise]\n\nSo we are supposed to be the good guys and the white hat\nHugh Thompson had several choices in that moment and he could say nothing to his fellow American he could join in with the soldiers on the ground or get try to stop them but given our biology and the culture that has been built on top of it trying to stop fellow American that was going to be pretty tough we\nAre primate we're mammals like a whole lot of them we're very very hard wired to divide the world and to us as\nRobert suppose gave the professor of biology and neurology at Stanford University we\nProcess Austin's them in group out group a categorization under a hundred milliseconds in our brand new imaging studies there are hormones exacerbate the contrast between us\nAnd I would venture to say unless you are the the Dolly along as friends basically all of us carry on us say capacity to make rapid Austin distinctions to be all that much\nIn this moment when Thompson faced a choice the question was in his mind when I was a\nShoo Thompson a lifetime of American national less sort of implications to who is an awesome\nAs long as others will challenge America secured [noise] and the ... of our beliefs as far as Steve spam [noise] partially the promise of two centuries\nAnd at a critical moment to shift to to send us an Oscar worthy surviving civilians in may lie she protected at great personal risk and then work has filled with American Soldiers who were being Savage\nWhen I did and struck line crews microchips and governor [noise] you know open up a lot of them as they open up on any more civilians\n[noise] I don't know [noise]\nI don't know how to sell it they would have opened up on that particular day I wouldn't have been in a second [noise]\n\nLabor the image that time I guess every day I'm sure they relate to the same on the ground [noise]\nThompson confronted lieutenant William Kelly within command about why he and his men were dealing with later be court martialed and convicted of murder for the rest of his life Thompson which are awarded ... for what he did in March of Nineteen sixty eight\nRight and if you know that there's a bucket that sort of genetic back it and the cultural back at it sounds like not at all they're just there's so much porous between those bucket and you can ... you can't separate one from the other\nExactly here and they seem to innovation ... I Am talking with Robert supposed to be a professor of biology and neurology at Stanford he's the author of the have the biology of human at our best and worst [noise]\nSo we've talked about culture we've talked about genetic if both of those had tremendous power very often beyond your control you you don't change the culture you're ... you grow up in usually you obviously cannot control your genetic\nWhat does that say to you about free well and our ability to shape our own lives [noise]\nWell if you spend enough time looking at how we are shaped by everything from a supplemental sensory stimulus ten seconds ago to why humans evolved to ways they are a rather than being ...\nWe'll start seeming mighty suspect ... one can argue till the cows come home with certain branches of philosophers but in terms of that I come out as what's turned the heart determined that I don't think there's a shredder free will help there\nUm I think free will is what we call the biology that hasn't been uncovered yet\nAnd when you look at the history of our knowledge about what biology has to do with behavior\nWe've spent the last couple of centuries or so over and over repeating the same phrase which is why I had no idea that sort of biology had anything to do with it\nI had no idea that an epileptic seizure is a disease rather than someone who's been consulting with Satan mhm oh I had no idea circa Nineteen fifties that a child have a lot of trouble learning to read rather than being lazy and on motivated\nHas the cortical mal formations that we now call a learning disability and when you look at the sheer percentage of what we know\nAbout the biological shaping our behavior [noise]\nNinety five percent of it was discovered in the last half century Ninety percent of it in the last twenty five years eighty five percent since she woke up this morning and all that it's been happening is\nJust endless march of oh I had no idea of biology had to do with that and it is already convinced is of that and some of our most fundamental areas\nAnd at the end of the day I answer you could conclude there's no free will whatsoever and that's my spouse or at least you're going to have to admit there's a lot less free will than there used to be\nIn sort of western thinking and western values and judgments\nAnd it's getting squeezed into all sorts of really interesting places and that's just gonna keep happening and maybe down the line if you want to win sister was free will while you floss your upper teeth It's MORNING instead of your lower ones go for it be happy but\nI think by all watch it again this notion free will is just the biology we haven't discovered yet\nDoes that mean you think that all the time in your own life you know am I really think it'd be interesting primates maintenance Beijing and again and I really need that cookie or that already kind of bacon\nAll of them um you know mid again I'm totally intellectually comfortable with the notion that there is no free will whatsoever it's a myth\nWe are nothing more or less than our biology at the same time I haven't remotest idea how you're supposed to live a few actually started to believe in and to me there's obvious things to do which is completely revamp\nHow we do criminal justice and education and all sorts of other things like that\nBut at the end of the day like you know without question I showed that I'm a total hypocrite and there's not really in court brief dates like if I give a lecture and somebody comes up afterward and says oh good lecture I'll say thanks\nSo that's what I'm supposed to say no actually it's this them out to have my having adequate protein levels as a fetus and this and has to be called right yeah yeah and like how do you function that way I'm a certain level\nIf it's good to be hard for us to accept that there is no free will when it comes to judging them and they're awful behaviors um it's going to be that much harder should acceptance absolutely justice applicable when it comes to us in our laudable once\nI Want to go back and you just mentioned the criminal justice system so me and what you do how do you think about this and it's all about choices people make and how other people obviously cute to punish them or not punish them uh\nFor what they did well not not to sound like too much of a hothead here as if I haven't already but let's see just to sort of state it subtly the criminal justice system makes no sense whatsoever fears there is no souls there's no evil\nThere's no there's no punishment that you know if it's self I mean none of this stuff makes sense that the criminal justice system runs on neurobiology that's close to two hundred years old\nLiterally in what's called McNaughton ruling the difference between ... of knowing between right and wrong and other than that for the most part signal over the last two hundred years of behavioral science [noise]\nTwenty five percent of the men on death row in this country has a history of concussive head trauma to their frontal cortex\nAnd when you damage the frontal cortex us somebody who can know the difference between right and\nEvil makes much sense as invoking the notion of evil on a car who's breaks the failed hit somebody\nAn in both cases you don't leave them out on the street being dangerous but when you put a car in the garage because he can't fix the brakes and dangerous you don't sit there and say justice has been served\nAnd this car is not going to drive around in the countryside anymore on a sunny day it's just\nA mechanical problem and and they horribly simplified way we're biological machines and if it's ... to turn listened to machines in that way it's a hell of a lot better than demonizing us into having rotten souls when we may just have something screw with wander transmitter system\nIn some ways at the argument that you make really affect huge swath of our culture it seems to me like\nI think about the entire section of a book store right that is designed to help you succeed Martin life so that you know look to help you find that to help you succeed at work book to help you do well in school I can make friends that are\nAnd but there is no need for that section if it's pre determined whether you're going to succeed at work or you're going to make friends are you are not\nWill but nonetheless you've got to incorporate the fact in the air that behavior changes yeah\nAnd it's not determined to stick in the sense that like a puritan neurobiologist would have set a Plymouth Rock or something right right but it's been said in a much more interesting hopeful way for example\nI'm conventional language that we would use you sit there and you hear about the story of Hugh Thompson and you come out of their inspired inspired\nShe did something amazing my inspired\nTo fear was nothing which Jordan or a about his upbringing\nInspired five minutes before that he was no more amazing when you were me push pounce on one leg at a time it's a trip while maybe I could be more like Hugh Thompson so we've just given sort of an English description of what it is to be inspired by somebody\nWhat does that neural biologically and the fact that a human can do what he did\nAnd the fact that you just heard about it\nMight very well trained something and you're from the cortex and two and a half more neurons than we're working his way this morning are now involved in a sense\nWhen you're demoralized when you're deflated when you're for you to buy something those are as biological phenomena was anything else I don't think we do you fear traces so the fact was asked\nIf we can learn about the nature of the world and the process by definition that changes the nature of our brains are subsequent behaviors um is totally compatible with us as determined to stick biological organisms it just tells you go and study what's the most efficacious ways or\nTo like bring about good changes and lose friends of ours [noise] Robert de ... is a professor of biology and neurology at Stanford he's the author of the have the biology of humid at our best and worst Robert thank you so much thanks for having me on [noise]\nOkay with that in the law the average or not allowed to buy that land\nWas not the law so that African Americans couldn't buy the land it was there were restrictions in the deed of the land okay that you could not be sold to African Americans okay okay um this was a racially restrictive covenant a common place way in which racial segregation was enforced in America and the Jim Crow era\nAnd the court nonetheless ruled in favor of the amusement park saying that\nUh the amusement park was not owned by African Americans was owned by a corporation corporation may have been run by African Americans but the corporation had no race itself the court said I'm a and a really highlights an interesting an unexpected phenomenon I found in looking at the history of corporate rights is that\nIn many ways it the rights of corporations became tied up with questions of race slavery and civil rights\nJust like almost anything else in American history\n[noise] to go back to Mitt Romney that that famous quote you know corporations are people couldn't you argue and I I guess corporate has probably has that you know look corporations are a collection of people and um\nTheir interests you know when they fight for their interests whether it's talking about terrorists or whatever it is they are fighting to keep their workforce to not have to lay people off to be profitable share those profits\nUm isn't that in some you know I think ... you know people derided Mitt Romney but isn't that a reasonable way to look at things that corporations are a collection of people and they're trying to act in their best interest\nIs exactly the way the Supreme Court has tended to view corporations over the course of American history need for all the controversy over corporate personhood Citizens United never relies on that idea at all and in fact what I find in my book is that\nIf you look at the history of Supreme Court cases extending rights to corporations we find that most of those cases on the Supreme Court rejects the idea of corporate personhood and says instead the corporations are associations of people and that people come together in the corporate form and they shouldn't lose their rights\nThe lobby refuses to provide birth control is required under federal law and health care plans for employees\nUm that's you know ten thousand female employees who are adversely affected by that there isn't a that is made by a to pursue the interests of the four or five owners of the Hobby Lobby company um whose interests really should be a recognized the the people who contribute the money or the people who contribute the labor and everything else\nCan you imagine a whole bunch more cases coming down the pike like as more CEOs\nGet active and get involved um I think a bank of America that just a few months ago said they don't want to finance company that that make a weapons like the Eric Fifteen ah we've seen Patagonia to the Trump Administration over a national monument protection of national monuments\nI just wonder if there's going to be a whole new crop of these cases that tests the power of corporations\nWe're really seeing a flourishing of corporate rights cases and we're seeing\nLawsuits brought against graphics cigarette warnings we're seeing lawsuits brought against conflict mineral disclosures under the securities laws and and do you buy one study a full fifty percent of all First Amendment cases brought today are brought by corporations and trade associations that represents
