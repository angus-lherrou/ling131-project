only\nThe very first things that we see that we could call money like really are sets of transactional records that emerge in the ancient Near East in Mesopotamia\nBill ... is a cultural anthropologist and socio legal scholar at the University of California Irvine\nAll of a sudden we have this kind of new thing people a lot of people living in a place altogether meeting some kind of system of coordination so that they can all continue to live together in a sort of settled community with a population size it's getting to the point where I Can't keep track of who everyone is anymore\nAnd we start to see centralized systems to\nHelp people keep track of what they owe to whom wait what\nHe's describing ledgers system of recording obligations and their payment that's not what they taught us in school we all learned that money was simply an advancement on the earlier barter system chicken for grain for X. blades and so on everybody knows that\nIn primitive day's living was simple at least family produced whatever they need it the first kind of business was offered a good stone cutter for instance might make a few extra tools and simply trade them for ... other things he was it was easy there was no need for money\nMore from that delicious Nineteen forty seven educational film we heard earlier\nLife today is too complex people are too dependent upon each other jobs are too highly specialized for us to do business by bus\nMs says now we're no matter what we learned in school the anthropological record offers no evidence up simple barter anywhere\nIn the history yeah so\nThe barter story is a an origin story for money that you know has a very long history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be\nAnd in the nineteenth century as economic was becoming professionalized economists picked up this barter origin story for money and kind of set it forced into the world\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance you have to pack up pleaded string decorated with calories and other precious object which was used by the Danny people in New guinea to determine and to pay for the exact price of a pig\nThat's barter but but what you're really seeing is part of a much more complex series of relationships that people are engaged in that generally you have to do with some pretty serious social concerns concerns over birth over marriage over deaths over the continuation of a lineage or a tribe\nWhere the pig in this case isn't just any old pig being exchanged and I always think of you know Charlotte's Web in this\nContext some ...\n\nSome pig it's some tickets a special pig that indicates a relationship between families it's not just a commodity that's value can be set by the price mechanism the way that the barter story assumes\nSo how did this border mythology or become some nearly universal why is this news\nTo me very often origin stories are serving contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today and that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable\nThen something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps disabled look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of bonds which is what economists call that problem when you know I've got fish and you've got apples and you don't want my fish and I don't want your Apple's\nSo it's great to justify current conditions but when you start kind of cracking it open and starts at appealing back\nA lot more interesting and a lot more complicated and involved things like record keeping accounting systems of measure uh states and early state control and shaping of markets and so forth well

both have the built in season ... of those plants and animals to deal with\nAnd what we start to see in those situations is the emergence of central authorities\nCentral clearing houses which had some properties of temples absorb spiritual authority and some of thanks\nSo this is going to kind of over simplify it but we basically right little contracts to each other that say things like okay look
