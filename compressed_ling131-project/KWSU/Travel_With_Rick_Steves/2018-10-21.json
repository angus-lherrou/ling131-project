of shows you earn it\nThis week Warren responded by way of a five and a half minute pre campaign video in it and she speaks with Carlos Bustamante a Stanford genetics professor who examine to DNA\nAnd the genome we did find five segment of Native American ancestry with very high confident taxes you asked that we have a Native American ancestry and you're better\nThe response was probably not what Warren had anticipated she\nCame out and thought she scored at first and showed in the media and it's sort of the men and Donald Trump pay off the million dollar bet and then all of a sudden now she is at war with the Cherokee Nation and saying that are used to the DNA test is inappropriate and court undermining tribal interest\nBoth the right and the last appropriate and accusations that she's not native enough that she is reinforcing biological is\nClaim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity bottom sides a political miscalculation but also a stone into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere's a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a turkey princess when their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\n... professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nStory for us has a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer\nI don't mean to sound cliche but everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual land and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims the ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family in tribe or not govern so strongly by the idea of having distant unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA and ever since talk of blood and lineage and said\nHave given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk plays out in native culture\nI caution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you weren't looking at tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum these are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors but dogs\nOnly men and settler ideas a family at the time to be had household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men and then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments\nYou had to have a register of Indians well tribesmen first nations and other indigenous communities didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people in their can these are fluid can ship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment as governor and what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base real you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nWhen you see on the back of my traveling rolling card that I'm One thirty second best one sixteenth as one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy in Iraq a whole blood quote unquote is my grandfather Randy told there\nIt's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this was the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were\nFor us it's who's your mom who's your grandmother who's your great grandfather who are your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because some these blood quantum rules\nIn my tribe the ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base wrong but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining a rabbit hole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly thirteenth thirty seconds\nNative American my daughter would be one half of that because her father's non native now my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate that sets\n[noise] and I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards Libya will defend rules to try to make our roads more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonized we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with a U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore [noise]\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood then the women and this is something much she got some set in the New York or you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his ... you know\nI don't think he has an intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren and if I mean really I [laughter] she has her her entire life like many people in Oklahoma and the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this myth of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family's story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nBut you're saying it's really relevant even if they did\nRight but but for for non native people who have a subtler colonial idea of kinship in ancestry and family finding that genetic proof is important to them\nWhy do you think they do it\nI think they're very much influenced by that one drop rule that are so prominent in racial discourse in the United states\nI have one drop back there somewhere therefore I can make a claim that is very racialized thinking and again native people in the U. S. are not completely exempt from that we struggle with that because it's imposed on us\nAlondra thank you very much to pleasure to speak with uber\nAlondra Nelson is president of the social science Research Council professor of sociology at Columbia University and author of the social life of\nDNA race reparations and reconciliation after the gene [noise]\n\nAnother application of genetic research and another time the controversy twins [noise] this is only [noise]\nOn the media is supported by target preventing future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing and communities nationwide future\nNorthwest public broadcasting is a channel for ideas and stories that expand your horizons every day\nIf you're a member thank you for your support listeners like you and businesses such as what people have Moscow and Hodge instructing hobby also support the resource of lifelong learning learn more at N.

[noise]\n\nThis is on the media I'm Brooke Gladstone the double helix structure of ... right below nucleic acid or DNA was discovered just sixty five years ago but mankind has been playing with the

conceal what they did from the people who did it when you play with him and do something very easy\nTo come up with those was\nThe secret study orchestrated by psychologist Peter New power to examine how three distinct parenting styles might shape identical triplets weird apart\nNot until the boys met by chance age Nineteen did they learn how their lives have been manipulated for a trove of data that remains largely locked away in an archive at Yale\nAccording to Dr Nancy ... the director of the twin studies center at California State University at full attend the unreal the study was likely inconclusive and definitely cruel\nWell I I think this was a very unethical study keep in mind that even though in those times the practice with it and you don't encourage contact\nBut nevertheless these children were never told they were twins and most of his adoptive parents who are hungry for children would have gladly taken too so to not tell people is very important aspect of their background\nThink is just horrendous it's really beyond my comprehension and I wanted\nBecause being a twin is a very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart just how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture the public imagination but none quite like not the twin study which tracked the genetic profiles of two astronaut brothers one has spent a year in space while a twin lived on earth the me had a few days\nFollowing DNA altering space mission they may not be identical anymore or your faith has already made got two inches taller than his brother\n... seven percent of Scott's James or not return to normal after he returns from years ago\nSo they're no longer identical twins that space travel altered genetic expression it did not older the DNA physically itself\nWhen he returned to earth the vast majority of his genetic material to return to the way it was initially see this is a fascinating finding because why did tickle twins differ in the expression of some ... that's what we need to find out\nI think it'll fascinates your listeners to know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia\nOr multiple sclerosis or diabetes it expected the correlation should be about one they have the same genes but it's closer to forty fifty percent something has to trigger the expression in one and keep it quiet and the other end identical twins right apart or identical twins difference I'm white\nAnd help us find these environmental effects\nThat might help us control and manage disease [noise]\nYou've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life histories of two says identical male twins who are born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city\nAnd the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north but one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as the other twins were born and somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange with one of the other twins for the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other I went to Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate wearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role the twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges\nThe similarities really popping out and the medical life history are amazing the one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary [noise]\nSo what does this tell you about nature versus nurture it was too small sample I Know but yes but it's a very dramatic case and so we told me a couple of things in terms of the abilities one could certainly see that not having access to education\nLeft an indelible stamp on those twins but I Will say that one of the twins who was raised in\nThe small town who should have been raised in Bogota\nWent and got himself a GED a high school diploma and is now finishing law school so we always have the drive he didn't have the opportunity but I have also become very appreciative of extreme environments and how they influence behavior I think that this is a very telling case and so many ways", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Travel With Rick Steves", "city": "Pullman", "day": "21"}
