on the term\nIt is by definition\nSomething to be thrown away and it's a dangerous way to talk\nHuman being about our country this Sunday on weekend edition from NPR News\nYou can hear weakens edition tomorrow morning starting at five right here on the NPR News service of North Korea's public broadcasting\nThe un might be in New York this was on the media and Bob Garfield is the way I'm Brooke Gladstone this week in the opinion pages of the wall Street Journal and judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote I Know my tone was shot and I said a few things I should not knowing that he regretted the worse thing in his this\nGame until this process and and as I write this I don't know yet how topping off hasn't yet the one the post he seeks a Supreme judicial umpire [noise] he's just to play courtside contingent mass\nLess when girls are Democrat Joe I served on the judge to know\nIs a Muslim short\nMore successful confirmation for judge Kavanaugh this weekend would be the case or to a nearly month long rumble again consequences for hurting women that me too movement strives to apply\nWhen we spoke with late staff writer lily Luther last November she explained for all of the logical fallacies used by the culture to excuse or ignore bad behavior we called on her again\nTo identify the new fallacies she's seen lately like the anti bandwagon fallacy\nThe anti bandwagon fallacy it's something I kind of made up to explain that tendency that I've noticed where a news items trees content actually diminishes for people as more accusations emerged we saw for instance with Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nI've never seen so many were pressed memory cases in my life especially against one\nOf the question is if there's something going on what's known as a conspiracy\nYeah more emerged a lot of people I think on the right interpreted that to be a bandwagon [laughter] that invalidated the initial accusation something else that I heard recently is that ... effect or technique which is the way that a lot of people who are accused\nRespond ... stands for deny attack and reverse a victim an offender Donald\nTrump has really excelled at finding a way to carry every accusation against him into an occasion for his victimization and by extension the victimization of those who associate themselves with him\nWe certainly see Brett Kavanaugh doing something similar we find male anger I think very disorienting because men are told to repress and so when we see somebody in a very high stakes situation and loading powerfully that tends to have to scan as an index of authenticity\nIn front of a nation we saw his righteous indignation neutral by\nHis peers and fury not a doctor for but rather on this on for confirmation process which frankly\nTestimony in her as as equally credible which I found it's done is sharing but once again we tend to find anger especially when it comes from a man to be somehow corroborating it's one of the things that we are taught\nAnother thing that was on display this week is that men now must live in fear\nDid all the right things that they would be among the chosen and saved and everyone else would be wiped away in a in a massive flood or or some kind of catastrophe meaning all the white people meeting all white people and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes dance was a religion that was growing around at the Pine Ridge agency\nAnd there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nWas never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folks at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seven cavalry stopped spotted outspent sue as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them\nThe next day they moved to disarm them it's not really known what caused the shooting in the first place but almost immediately the government open fire with ... cannons on largely an armed men women and children\nThe descriptions of the massacre are horrifying\nYou quoted a reporter from the Deadwood South Dakota times who wrote why should we stay or even a ... of an Indian and then you have an el Frank bomb author of the wonderful wizard of Oz writing for the south Dakota Saturday pioneer he said\nHaving wrong to them for centuries we had better in order to protect our civilization\nFollow it up with one more wrong and wipe these on paint and I came up all creatures from the face of the earth\nBy virtue of of being wrong to run our threat\nAlmost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceedings four hundred years of interactions between calling us an indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything had to come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the mosque car they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yet the browns Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college I was thrilled to be introduced\nIs about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars and the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization if the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through the modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I felt by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and held up on one hand and then silence didn't done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\n[noise] it took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just\nDifferent facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate missed the point\nWhen did me was a low point we had with stood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realize and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist well then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns book came out describe what happened\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared it Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with a Caucasian and having us this land nearby off the following treated real purchased said health Rhode Island\nAll I think it was kind of students from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nAs we got down there the whole the whole court was covered with the FBI right they all had rifle shotgun and and it's and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock\nMy own personal view is that the takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWas it really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had done a dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and it lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing timber and mineral leases among other things\nThe government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and the takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself and the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ... one of Nixon's guys back man even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of at sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\n[noise] and then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering in and chest\nBelieve that the time this current is that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see and hear the kinds of violence might happen to be committed [noise]\nThere'd been a number of very high profile murder of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge\nAnd in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place ... and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who\nWere murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or\nMisdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd sell for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three women get me was under siege [noise]\n\n\nAre\nYou saying had very complicated feelings about it\nI did aim activists showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people that travel government of Pine Ridge was very against the stick Wilson the German uh Pine Ridge was interested mostly in staying in power\nAnd he was working closely with the federal state government to sort of bringing more and more law enforcement so there's again another military buildup everything kind of boiled over and aim activists took over the winning a trading post and subsequently took over the entire village of wounded knee at first holding village residents some of whom were not native hostage\nAnd then later the hostage just had we refer you to go to any time we just didn't want to go and we figured if we did go to the government would kill all the Indians they're actually very sad\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so [noise]\nIn my mind it's a story of surplus [noise]\nThat's the story I Want to tell [noise] David thank you so much thank you so much I'm really speaking out to be on the show David\nDreier is a chip away from the leech lake reservation in Minnesota he's a professor of

should claims solidarity with the minorities seems straightforward enough but probably not because of Germany's racists far right party alternative for Germany\nClaims kinship with the plight of Native Americans German historian Frank who's back was dumbfounded when he first came across Indian imagery in an alternative for Germany me back and to pass and fortunately\nI found it hilarious at first\nIt was in a tweet by one of the local branches of ... the alternative for Germany their tweets showed the photograph of who didn't ... it said the Indians couldn't stop immigration and now they live on reservations\nAnd that's what is going to happen to us here in Germany if we are not careful\nAnd it's not even unique to Germany in two thousand six it was used in an election campaign in Switzerland and ever since then\nYou find it in the argumentation an election campaigns of many European right wing party in Austria Switzerland is totally Germany\nHungary you'll find similar arguments in Great Britain and other countries as well\nIt appears that these extreme parties are trying to appeal to Germany's profound fascination with the American front and there's even a term for this phenomenon\nIndian Susie ...\nActually share similar routes\nThey go hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds that Germany's were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all the German meaning states were either under military occupation or had been forced to become allies of Napoleon\nSo nationalist try to look for a unifying feature something of a creation as\nThe French have joann of art the British have king Arthur so these early nationalist went all the way back to the Germanic tribes and their resistance against the encroaching Roman Empire\nInteresting thing is that ... is one of the very few sources do cry these tribes as on a loyal her rule week fears and criticized his own society as they could end and over civilized\nIf we go back to the late Eighteen some early Nineteen century\nFrench philosophers drones are Corso used very similar attributes defining Native Americans as noble savages\nGermans felt that their temperament what's akin to that of the noble stoppage\nExactly entered around notions off rigid and freedom being attuned to nature to forest was sacred homeland\nWhich throughout the nineteenth century became a root off a blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the lake nineteenth century that was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer\nTry so everything seems to lead to calm ... and his famous couple of characters the German immigrant and adventure old had her hand and his Apache friend written into\nThe farthest west he actually got was the Niagara falls way after he wrote his novels in the early Eighteen\nBecause he could not this fall is out with one explosive punch exactly Apache teeth and then to see to me the really popular among the German public right\nYes he is an ... an incredible Native American chief because he never hangs out with his own people [laughter]\nShe's always out there by himself looking for white people you can help\nAnd Carl my made him eat the Arctic enough to fit into the frame of the adventure\nBut at some scholars described it to you also seems to be a very good German [laughter] because he has a character trait that their German ... was the worst supposed to strive towards like on the\nBravery industrious nests\nThese novels had him very long life what's Hitler\nYet it is sad that late in the war when there was hardly any paper left Hitler allocated enough paper to distribute a hundred thousand vena two novels to their troops\nBecause he said reading about Venus who will help German officers do you with your ... warfare on the Eastern Front\nThat venue to what the ideal company commander wasn't\n[laughter] there were those people who said German children should only be confronted with area and heroes [noise]\nHowever Hitler was a fan and also pragmatist said it would cost too much effort to try to press German Indian Suzie as them why not hard at it and profit from it [noise]\nPeople like you know how we take a novelist who wrote under the pseudonym ... said preventing Indian novel to German children
