with live election results and analysis from around the U.S [noise] critical election central covered in our new\nIn central reporting every day on MORNING edition all things considered and weekend edition\nThis is on the media I'm Bob Garfield on election day Massachusetts citizens will weigh in on a referendum known as question three\nA yes vote preserves existing protections for trans individuals' against discrimination in public spaces a no vote returns the state to it's pre twenty sixteen status quo in which transgender was not illegal a protected class\nThe messaging on the no side of question three has featured the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle within the American culture wars including this attack ad produced by the no on three campaign\nWent in and I\nMean any man and woman can and kind of woman can block around any kind [noise] now I'm going down the man [noise] go too far [noise]\nIt's almost comical ... anti trans video but in a remarkable exercise in political hold me up at the the activists on the other side of the question many themselves trends went door to door to share that ad\nWith potential voters it was not a random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman\nWho a few years ago in Florida on another trends related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charge the angel political process of door to door canvassing but just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nAnd a lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there's no way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories but well we actually found in the research is that canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training\nOr able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so\nI think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if they're approached in such a way from a\nFriendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation with them\nSo once you initiated the perspective having what's the effect the person becomes suddenly more open to other ... groups like trends citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you'd randomly assigned\nEither get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group that got a door knocking about recycling what we find when we do a series of follow up surveys three days three weeks six weeks and three months later is that when we compare the group that we had that\nConversation with at the door versus the group we could have but did not that treatment group is significantly more accepting of transgender people across the variety of items the average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is it if you look at the change on items that measure attitudes towards gay men and lesbians and that average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve we see a similar effect from these\nTen twenty minute conversations as we see in the public in general from Nineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big\nEffect does this and knock you laid them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing\nOne thing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those trends phobic advertisements to say well if we show them these ads is the effect of the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner\nWe do find the ad has some immediate effect we still find a treatment ... campus is much more supportive more over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely ... what we find time and again if the effects of those kinds of mass media advertisements are very ephemeral\nNo doesn't your research fly in the face of academic orthodoxy on the matter of campaigns very\nWe're actually enter and it's really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine moved from putting leeches on people and tell the anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so you should put a leash on yourself to\nWhere we are kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous real world randomized trials that revolutionized medicine so\nThere's different versions of orthodoxy depending on who you describe too but my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little about the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the the last word on the matter it's much more like one of the first words on the matter at this particular kind of intervention but we're doing lots of follow up work on other issues like immigration abortion to kinda flush out or understanding of this\nTB campaigns Rachel lot a lot a lot of people and a door to door canvassing is limited to the number of volunteers who have to fan out in the community which is ...\nSo let's just say the effects that you found in your studies hold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom of political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns the Bernie Sanders' campaign or twenty sixteen the ... campaign right now in Texas and many others who was defeated in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so from my perspective if campaigns don't try and really\nThink about the art and science of recruiting volunteers and building a team to talk to their neighbors\nThen it's no surprise but if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success\nAnd in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy the normative leap might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or to do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to be able to bankroll serious field team\nWhat you need is a candidate or a cause that many kinds of engaged individual want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three\nWill that tell us anything definitive about inoculation is there some way that we could find ourselves on sound or statistical floating on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nI wouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election results that's kind of a trap that that research on campaigns and elections and campaign consultant has been for a hundred years\nWhat we really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign if they had done something else which of course we can't know because the campaign only happened a particular way so that's why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else to say we can actually see what happens when we do this and when we don't\nYeah but just between you and me should I be like investing heavily in clipboard futures\nWell I think what we tend to see in other industries with that as new ideas and innovations come out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so\nI don't know that I think that campaigns will or even necessarily should be taking this one study we have and you know reorientate all their activities around it within the next year I Hope on the scale of ten or twenty\nGets a will be interested in applying in their work\nDavid thank you so much sure thank you David Bruck man it's a political scientist at the graduate business school of Stanford University Matt Collette has been reporting on the question three campaign for the WNYC podcast Nancy\nMatt welcome to Adrienne thanks up I'm All right so in the late summer you went up to Massachusetts and you tagged along with the door to door campaign in support of yes unquestioned three that is to say yes people these laws on the books when did that case they looked like\nSo it's it's like super enthusiastic super grassroots organization what does the word people use a lot but like these\nVolunteer sessions began and ended with things that sort of doubled his training sessions and like we're all going to be OK group therapy session",
