the door [noise]\nYeah so uh right now I'm like in the machine in Logan lamb has a voting machine in his living room [noise] this is what one looks like I'm inside so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta\nHis specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines she has is the kind Georgia uses edits polling places the machine it's bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between the Nintendo and a Bible Logan booted up\nAct you touch the litter and then it's the compressed being the image is one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that bull chime at the beginning and you go to every time\nThis is a direct recording electronic machine or DRA it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cybersecurity tight that's a major red flag\nIn fact dear he's had been criticized by technologist basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines as paper ballot and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again like last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security\nRon Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nYou wanted to get her official position on electronic voting machines\nAnd I'd like to get your views for the record of whether you believe the continued use of paperless

counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you can inject information or inject basically now we're a virus into any part of this tree [noise] the way it

vulnerabilities of its voting system\nBy the way throughout the hearing kept team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none fat\nPacking she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they can mean a paranoia for research based findings of national\nCyber security engineers an expert so that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with informal systems in machines but very few people trust\nKennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does to people I\nTalked to said that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight team\nAnd it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that we know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question let me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of

W. P. B. dot org that Wednesday from six to seven on northwest public broadcasting [noise]\nStay right here more of reveal as and store [noise]\nFrom the center for investigative reporting in pie or at least is revealed by mail it today we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud [noise] people are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been thing\nMany places like California the same person votes many times you probably heard about that they always like to say oh that's a conspiracy theory not a conspiracy theory for millions and millions of people\nThose claims have been totally the bar but one of the people who got those theories going with the Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach he's the Kansas secretary of state\nAnd while that typically a pretty sleepy office he's a household name in his home state even used to have a weekly radio show\nMe the worst nightmare constitution bars to keep them from making trouble for any other\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning Trump appointed him to run his so called election integrity commission it was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything\nYeah so Kobach is from a small state population wise but he has a big national profile in conservative circles how'd that happen\nSo Kobach is a longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people in question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that dating back to about\nTwenty ten and since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who backed that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native it movement\nSince then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud Kobach claims that illegal aliens that's attorney loves to use our voting in great numbers and this frog could be swinging elections\nThat way we know that that is not true\nWhen I started out I could drew a bunch of little zeroes in percentages at you here but according to the Brennan Center for justice it would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate and how their voter but that doesn't stop Kobach\nHe's a leader in the fight against it as\nWell it's a major problem [noise]\nYou interviewed cookbook last summer was elected person\nYou know what makes a really good politicians he's good looking he's charming he's really articulate but as a reporter he is also just maddening\nHe will tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight to on every term fan\nYears and said it would be the failed her you're using the term ... an actor to live with and you will thrill all these studies in statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he's still uses them it's like talking to Kris Kobach is arguing with your high school debate coach\nYou know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument\nAnd I think he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degrees from Harvard Yale University of Oxford and then he also has this other big help it's a tool called the interstate cross check system\nIt's a massive voter tracking program under Kobach agree to include more than half of the total voter registration\nCross check program it's free they share information between state\nKeeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicate voter registration and most often happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California did you call the secretary of state in Florida [laughter] no I did not [laughter]\nThat's okay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not illegal to be registered to vote in two states\nThat said it is illegal to vote in the same election in two different stage\nSo Kobach uses cross strict system to go after voter fraud\nThis is where Kobach dying in using cross check Kobach persuaded as a Kansas Legislature to give him the power to prosecute these cases by himself so he doesn't have to turn them over to the attorney general's office like the way it's done in all these other states\nOkay so all of a sudden Kris Kobach has the power over prosecutor what's he doing with it\nWell so far he's turned up nine cases of this alleged voter fraud he's prosecuted them as felonies and they mostly pleaded down to misdemeanors and most of the people he caught up in this are older white Republican men not", "year": "2018", "show_name": "To The Best of Our Knowledge", "city": "Pullman", "day": "22"}
