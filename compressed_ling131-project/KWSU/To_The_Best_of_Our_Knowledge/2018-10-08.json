add\nThat the pie was hardly the first thing that I thought\nAbout throwing it mark but every other time I wanted to throw something Adam I couldn't bring myself to do it\nOnce for example right after I found out about him and Selma I'd been seized by a violent impulse but the only thing I can see to throw at the time was assigned ... chair and I am far to boost walk to throw a scientist haunted anything at any one [noise]\nSometime later especially while I was in the hospital I gave considerable thought to smashing march head in with a very good frying pan [noise] that I had bought it the bridge kitchenware company but I always knew that I Would never do anything and the storage and in any case\nSmashing your husband's head in with the frying pan seems slightly to fraud with feminist content if you know what I mean [noise]\nOr even now I Wonder if I Would have thrown the pie if we'd been eating and Betty's dining room with probably not on the floor and Betty's dining room is a beautiful oriental rug and I would have been far too concerned about dating it\nFortunately though we were eating in the kitchen and the kitchen hasn't linoleum floor that is how bourgeois I Am at the split seconds I picked up the pie to throw it at mark\nThe thing that I've ever done in my life I thought to myself thank God the floors linoleum and can be wiped up [noise]\n\nUh on Saturday afternoon Betty called I went out for a walk to buy the pie ingredients I took than with me we had a long talk about how this Daniel would be coming home from the hospital on Monday and\nHow much and was gonna love him and how he was going to feed him some delicious spiders\nAnd we bought food names it was a beautiful day so we decided to walk down to the toy store on M. street and on the way we passed\nThe jewelry store where mark had bought me the diamond ring and I remember that I hadn't taken it in yet they haven't fixed it was in a little ... in my purse I could see Leo Rothman the owner sitting on a stool behind the counter Leo [noise]\nThe deer white haired man who had marched with the Abraham Lincoln brigade in the thirties and been thrown out of the Labor Department in the forties was now a millionaire jeweler who bust only white people through his electronically operated door\nShe bugs me in and gave me a big kid when mark with courting name 'em when he was pursuing me\nWith flowers in balloons and Jules Leo was the man that mark bought the jewels from and as a result Leo felt almost proprietary about our marriage she and outfitted the courtship the wedding the birth of the first trial the first child silver spoon\nShe didn't seem to mind that except for the diamond ring none of march purchases had amounted to more than a few hundred dollars [noise]\nI totally all about the robbery and he said it would just take a minute to reset the stone\nSalmon I waited while he got out his instruments and went to work we were making conversation chit chat nothing much um she said did I Know the diamond in the ... was a perfect stone I said mark told me that\nShe said it wasn't the kind of diamond I'd ever have trouble spelling if I ever wanted to be a told mark that he would be glad to buy it back for what mark had paid for it I said I was glad to hear that\nHe asked me how I like the necklace\n[noise]\nUh Leo looked up and the loop dropped from his eye I must be thinking of another customer he said no no no you're not I said I\nKnew my work had bought me some thing while I was in the hospital so he had bought her a necklace for her birthday I was lying in the hospital with a nose and he had bought her\nA necklace no fat rascal I said oh I shouldn't have said anything real sad oh I'm Glad you did I said now I Know what to be prepared for there is nothing worse than opening a box\nWith a necklace in it when you're\n[laughter] I kept talking I couldn't stop once I said I was in the mood for an eye out and mark kept dropping hands about what he'd gotten me for my birthday and finally I said I don't care what it is as long as it's not a suitcase\n[noise] was my face red [laughter]\nLeo was focused on the ring again I board him so thoroughly he barely rented a response he finished resetting the stone and handed the ring back to me\nIt was such a beautiful rang the diamond caught the afternoon sun and\nMade a rainbow on the wall of\nThe stores Sam ran to the reflection and I waved to drink this way in that moving the rainbow while she giggled and left and tried to catch it in his hands\nHow much\nI said oh no charge Leo said you know how much for the ring\nI said how much would you give me for the ring [noise]\nLeo looked at me um you don't really want to sell it he said oh no I really want to sell it [noise] I said do you really want to buy it of course he said oh I Love\nThe ring Leo but it really just doesn't go with my life it would never have been stolen in the first\nPlace if I hadn't been born this way and if you got a ring you were on the what's the point of view I guess it's sort of like having a mink coat [noise] if I had a mean cos I Would have to take care of every time I'm In new\nYork and the next thing you know we'd be even broker than we are now [laughter] markets so romantic she'd probably spent\nFor the down payment I said it's a beautiful necklace said Leo\nNow have a beautiful necklace I won't be able to wear on the subway either I said how much for the ring Fifteen thousand Leo said Fifteen thousand\nI said that's what mark paid for it they said my heart started to pound\nI realize that I had just been given the means to walk out of my marriage\nFifteen thousand it is I said to Leo\nTen years had passed the cost of walking out of a marriage had gone up [noise] I went home with ... checks and made the pie I was in a trance well I don't know perhaps it wasn't a trans but it was a close to transit all ever get\nI was speechless I said nothing nothing at all for several hours [noise]\nAt age I'm Mark and I took the pie ... it was just us um me mark Betty and Dimitri who bet he lives with [noise] when we got\nTo Betty's mark and Dimitri went into the kitchen to boil lobsters and Betty and I sat in the living room while\nBut he talked about the dance that she and Selma and I were apparently\nGiving apparently we were giving it at the so grave club apparently the crap man had already been booked apparently all that was lacking was my guess lift film and Betty had already drawn upstairs and apparently the Kissinger or on film is lift\nJustice I predicted I sat\nAnd listen and drank an entire bottle of white wine as Betty went on and on and by the time I was tipsy\nWe ate the lobsters I don't remember the conversation [noise]\nUm I Do remember realizing that no one seems to be noticing that I hadn't said anything the entire evening and that no one seemed to mind\nI must try this again I thought I must try again someday to sit still and not say a word maybe when I'm dead [noise]\nAfter the lobsters I took the key line pie out of the freezer and put the whipped cream on it and sat it in ...\nAnd that's when ... turned to me and she said Rachel you didn't tell me about\nRichard and Helen what about Richard Allen said mark what they're getting a divorce said Betty I bumped into him this week in New York I always hated that woman said mark I sort of liked her said Dmitri when did you meet her said Betty\nHere said Dmitri Rachel I'm are brought them over one night and no one else would talk to her so why did she wasn't so bad you were the only person on this earth who's ever found anything even halfway nice to say about her said\n[noise]\nHe's revealed um outlet [noise]\nMe big ... big you would not I\nSpeaking with the Y. veteran prisoner expert in

sprinting towards him every every two years [noise]\nConrad and his family are torn apart not just because princes in jail but because he's in jail for so long\nWhat did he do to get locked away for a long period of time\nThe habitual offender statue and usually you don't hear about it until someone's charged for some minor crime like stealing a flood of sodas and the district attorney or chief prosecutor Leon Kenneth Arrow uses a lot to hammer them to pay\nFor our noble has served four years of his more than Thirteen year sentence for carrying less than three grams of marijuana\nLouisiana has one of the strongest repeat offender laws in the U.S and in New Orleans that could put a man in prison for a possible Twenty years to life for stealing candy bar to Kobe Bryant\n[noise] or\nI've never met Conrad son prince in person but we talk on the phone and say that again\n\nYeah princes in a jail that over five hours from New Orleans where he's from the phone is in this one huge noisy room where he also sleeps and nice and spends his days along with over a hundred other men we've been talking for months one day prince caught me when I was really stressed out [laughter]\n\n... my hair down did you say [laughter]\n\nI said look the because of the habitual offender statue ... explain that well\nPrince was arrested a few times for drug charges which means he's known as a multiple offender or habitual offender and this law can now be applied to him here's how it works the more times you commit a felony the harsher and harsher punishment gets\nAnd regular here's a seven years but in ... and feels like an attorney\nThompson worked for tennis arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office used the habitual offender statute back then\nWhen I was going on and on point nine percent of the time I mean it was just there was a standard as the loan officers relied or a better way of describing here that was the way it was\nSo basically anytime that you could use that that too often or statute with the policy of the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of any answers where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their toy box when they need it but it's like do you tend to zero never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere's this mindset that the more before we lock up in the more time that we give people the more we want to stop the crime problem but as far as fun as far as ... you know harsh sentences or the time\nOrleans public defender Danny ... says Kennedy era office still uses ... statute all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their rights\nThe way you talk to your choir started anyway you talk to the prosecutor and to the judge even the considerations with the prosecutors making bail argument so even from the moments of your arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge Orleans Parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was in the middle of summer when it was over a hundred degrees outside he wasn't wearing a judge's road instead black polo shirt black pants given the heat I had to tease him about it what is it all like\nOf heavy but he said\nOver his blaring air conditioner the judge's job is kind of like our rafts between the defense and the prosecution asked judge hunter what he thinks of this law\nTakes away positive primary functions of a judge\nWhich is to fashion a census that's appropriate specifically for that particular person\nBecause when district attorney's use the habitual offender statute judges no longer decide how long a person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory sentences kick and the judge has\nNo choice if I have someone with mental health issues on drug abuse issues I wanted that treatment aspect they're conforming to be part of the sentence with the ... on the twenty twenty five years that will be there now taxes say twenty twenty five thousand a year for someone just to go away in ... [noise]\nI also went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da da\nNang minutes away just up the Mississippi River the populations as east Baton Rouge parish and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics around half white half black their da ... ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just like ...\nI Lived in a strike on her show oh you do you're going to talk so I'll be going on in Wall Street\nHeller more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports again scan is arrows private Catholic high school but they are white men both have been da for a decade\nYou know for me I Will send is just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa more ... this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything there was public safety can you sort of infected with no charm and jail or the public sector really the ...\nSixty six times now let's talk about what da Kenneth Arrow does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data and the same ten years ten is arrow has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times oh\nI shared this number with the da and his spokesman denied it the da's office only started keeping data on the habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I have\nI never heard back and an email the DEA spokesman said their office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and choose instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims [noise]\nThe reason these two da's ... so different is because every da ... Russian to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if prints have been prosecuted for drug\nPossession an east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already [noise]\nFrom what you're saying it's like ... has the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken is there are always emphasizes this oh his\nDuty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nI'd be remiss if I had what I consider to be prosecuted ... case and simply said I'm not going to prosecutors because I just don't agree with the law that's really my call that's where you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not\nBut if it if it is the law I think I ever responsibility to prosecute it if the facts are facts support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing and New Orleans [noise]\n\n\n... I'm just doing my job why does he doing his job so differently than any other da in Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the habitual offender statute that's how it's done and this man just hearing from a very squeaky chair can explain why\nMy name is Kenneth than a ... a coal criminal laws\nBe a G G you a big you would do I not that I Need you know this is my ... my war room [laughter]\nIt's next to his kitchen and full of paper stacked by his computer tape to the walls this is where biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the seventies he saw this law which had been around for a really long time basically come back from the dead\nBecause the law the multiple bell which is one of its many names\nNobody was doing it but when ... came into office [noise]\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait wait wait wait wait a minute here the the he was just saying Harry ... jazz singer\nNo that's the junior [noise]\nThis was his dad Harry comic senior\nWhen Harry
