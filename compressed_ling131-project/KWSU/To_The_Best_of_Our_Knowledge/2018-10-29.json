occurred up the railroad station [noise] she had come with her children small John and her baby girl to meet her husband when he returned\nLate and perhaps even seeming on eager to encounter her husband after a week's separation she dressed the children and put them into the car at home along half hour before the train was do as a result of course they had to wait intermittently up the station\nAnd what was to have been a charming league staged a reunion family embracing husband and father became at last and ill timed and awkward performance\nSmall John's hair was must and he was sticky\nThe baby was cross pulling at her pink bonded and her dainty lace edged dress whining\nThe final arrival of the train called them in mid movement as it were\nMargaret was tying the ribbons on the baby's bonnet small John was half over the back of the car seat they scrambled out of the car cringing from the sound of the train hopelessly out of sorts Jones senior waved to from the ... steps of the train\nUnlike his wife and children he looked utterly prepared for his return as though he had taken some pains to secure a meeting at last painless\nAnd had in fact stood just so\nWaving court to leave from the steps of the train for perhaps as long as half an hour ensuring that he should not be caught how Freddie his hand not lifted so far as to over emphasize the extent of his delight in seeing them again\nHis wife had an odd sense of last time\nStanding now on the platform with the baby in her arms and small John beside her she could not for a minute remember clearly whether he was coming home or whether they were yet standing here to say goodbye to him\nThey had been correlating when he left and she had spent the week of his absence determining to forget that in his presence she had been frightened and hurt\nThis will be a good time to get things straight she had been telling herself while John is gone I can try to get hold of myself again\nNow on shore at last whether this was an a rival or a departure she felt\nThis will not do it she thought believing that she was being honest with herself\nAnd as he came down to train steps and walked toward them she smiled holding the baby tightly against her so that the touch of its small warmth might bring some genuine tenderness into her\nWe need things together things we like both of us small delicate pretty things um I agree with John ... she would have felt it necessary to remark at once that they could not afford such a delicate pretty things then put a cold\nNot everything would be right I saw a little creature once he said\nLike a little tiny man only colored old purple and blue\nAnd gold\nShe remembered this conversation it contained the truth like a jewel set in the evening\n[noise] much later she wants to tell herself that it was true drawn could not have said these things she was happy\nShe was radiant she had no conscience\nSki went to be the lead to his office the next morning saying goodbye at the door with a room full smile that seemed to mock the president ... for doing the things that John always did\nAnd she walked him go down the walk she reflected that this was surely not going to be permanent she could not indoor having him go on for so long every day [noise] although she had felt a little about parting from John\nMoreover if he kept doing ... things the mind to grow in ... more like John\nWe will simply have to go away she thought she was pleased seeing him get into the car she would gladly share with him indeed gave him out right old that had been John's so long as he stayed her stranger\nShe laughed while she did her housework and dress the baby she took satisfaction in on packing his suitcase which he had abandoned and forgotten in a corner of the bedroom as though prepared to take it up and leave again if she had not been as he bought her\nHad not wanted him to stay she put away his clothes so disarming Li like Johns and wondered for a minute the closet\nWould there be a kind of a delicacy in him about John ... things\nThen she told herself no not so long as he had been with John's wife and she laughed again\nThe baby was cross all day but when small John came home from nursery school his first question was looking up eagerly where his daddy daddy has gone to the office\nAnd again she left at the moments quick ...\nShe went upstairs to look at his suitcase and touched the leather softly she glanced constantly as she passed\nThrough the dining room into the corner where the small shelves would be some day and told her self that they would find a tiny little man all purple and blue and gold to stand on the shelves and guard them from intrusion\nWhen the children awaken from their naps she took them for a walk and then away from the house and returned violently to her former lonely pattern\nWalk the children talk meaningless Lee a daddy long for someone to talk to in the evening ahead restrain herself from hurrying home\nHe might have telephoned she began to feel frightened again suppose she had been wrong\nIt could not be possible that she was a mistake and it would be on a true believer cruel for John to come home\nTonight then she heard the car stop and when she opened the door and looked up she thought now it is not my husband with the return of blackness\nShe was aware from his smile that he had perceived her doubts and yet he was so clearly a stranger that seeing him she had no need\nOf speaking\nShe asked him instead almost meaningless questions during that evening and his answers were important only because she was storing them away to reassure herself while he was away\nShe asked him what was the name of their Shakespeare professor in college and who was that girl he likes so before he met Margaret\nWhen he smiled and said that he had no idea that he would not recognize the name if she told him she was in the light the had not bother\nTo master all of the past that and he had learned enough the names of the children the location of the house\nHow she liked her cocktails to get to her and after that it was not important because either she would want him to stay or she would calling upon John send him away again\nWhat is your favorite food she asked him are you on to fishing did you ever have a dog\nI was back from Boston and I distinctly thought he said that he heard that I was dead in Boston\nAnd\nHe was lonely too she thought was sadness and this is why he came bringing a destiny with him now I Will see him come every evening through the door and think this is not my husband\nAnd wait for him remembering that I Am waiting for a stranger [noise]\nAt any rate she said you are not dead in Boston and nothing else matters\nShe saw him leave in the morning with a warm pride and she did her housework and dressed the baby when small John came home from nursery school he did not ask ... looked with quick searching eyes and inside\nWhile the children were taking their naps she thought that she might take them to the park this afternoon\nAnd then the thought of another such afternoon another long afternoon with no one but the children another afternoon of we do hood was more than she could submit to I have done this too much she thought I must have seen some\nThing today beyond the faces of my children no one should be so much a low and\nMoving quickly she dressed and set the house to rights she called the high school girl and asked if she would take the children to the park\nWithout guilt she neglected the thousands of small orders regarding the proper jacket for the baby whether small John might have popcorn when to bring them home she fled\nThinking I must be with people\nShe took a taxi into town because it seemed to her that the only possible thing to do with seek out a gift for him or her first gift for him and she thought she would find him perhaps a little creature all blue and purple and gold\nShe wandered through the strange shops in the town choosing small lovely things to stand on the new shelves looking long and critically at ... at small statues at brightly costs\nIt was almost dark when she started home carrying her packages she looked from the window of the taxi into the dark streets and ... with pleasure that the stranger would be home before her\nAnd look from the window to see her hurrying to him he would think this is a stranger I Am waiting for a stranger as he saw her coming\nHere she said tapping on the glass right here driver\nShe got out of the taxi and pay the driver and smiled as he drove away I must look well she thought the driver smiled back at me\nShe turned and started for the house and then hesitated surely she had come too far this is not possible she thought this cannot be surely our house was white\n\nThe evening was very dark\nAnd she could see only the house is going in rows with more rose beyond them and more rose beyond dot and somewhere\nA house which was worse with the beautiful stranger inside and she lost out here\n[noise] surely\n[noise] I told you she got pregnant just when he was about to ask her for the divorce I shake the next coat and to cafeteria tickets pull out of the pockets one for spaghetti with meat balls and one for a cream soda I bet she did it on purpose part of the evils scheme\nShe isn't looking at me but she doesn't seem to be writing in the register anymore either\nShe's usually such a perfectionist but she can get pretty sloppy if she's thinking about her doctor\nWhen I asked him if he'd even told her he got defensive and came up with all these excuses [laughter] they're worried about the boy getting into the right elementary school his wife could go into premature labor she got some experiment running at the lab and can't be distracted the train got stuck in the snow\nLoad of crap she stopped for a moment and I read the label on the next coat she writes it down in the register I think\nThe coasts or in a pretty sorry state all wrinkled and stained blood spit urine tears he can tell by the color and the smell it's amazing all the stuff that can use out of a body\nOne lie leads to another I say she should know he finally showed up past ten last night\nTired from being stuck on the train for five hours\nTo the door at every little noise watching the dinner I'd made get cold she runs her hand through our hair looks down again\nHer skin is so white\nHer shoulders are really beautiful the pen rolls across the desk\nDo you know what he told me he said he had a lot of time to think on the train that he felt like some invisible force was holding him back that it wasn't the right time and that was why it had snowed\nHe said he wanted me to be patient to wait just a little longer just a little longer\nAnd then we screwed just like we always do that's all we have left\nI imagine her naked the doctors fingers running over her skin her hair the wet places I picture her tongue licking the edge of the blue on the loop who wouldn't want her\n[noise] gastrointestinal med too long up demolish the one short neurology one long pediatrics for short I pick up the pace trying to distract

the register and begin checking the coats myself trying to be a neat as she is that's why I killed him she says her voice is low and cold\nI feel a scream rising out of me but somehow I stop it hold it back\nAnd instead I calmly imagine the scene the knife and her pretty hand the blades slicing into him again and again skin ripping blood spurting but she's\nI pick up the next coat respiratory

hundred thousand homes in Houston\n\nThis is why Pam does this work today and why she's trying so hard for Denise in Cook County Illinois where Denise us from rejecting someone just because they have a section ... voucher is considered discrimination and it's illegal\nIt's also a legal and a handful of states including Massachusetts Oregon and New Jersey [noise]\nA few years ago Austin, Texas passed an ordinance like this but a few months later the state legislature overturned and lawmakers went even further they ban any other city in Texas from doing the same thing [noise] basically Texas landlords are allowed to discriminate against people with section ... vouchers and they can't be punished for it [noise]\nTexas was one of the first states in the country to pass a law like this twenty Fifteen Indiana did to the same year\nThat needs to know about the law when she moved here\nDoes your daughter does she understand that some people don't take vouchers and some people do take our church and she got that what she\nShe gets back to a certain extent\nBut I don't know how to understand [noise]\nUm [noise] the discrimination or part of it [noise]\nI don't want her to feel stereotype because of a voucher\nDenise was really hoping to use her voucher and one of two suburban ZIP codes both majority white very low poverty better schools [noise]\nBut out of a Seventeen thousand families that get vouchers from the Houston housing authority we found that only thirty six were living in those have post so what's going on here why are so many landlord unwilling to take vouchers in Texas\nWhere are those who will lose I should have sex with a discriminatory tool\nLittle this is Stacey Hi he's on the board of the Houston apartment association and he supports that Texas law that less landlords they noticed section eight [noise] after it passed housing advocacy group sued they said this is racial discrimination in disguise my colleague Edgar Walter interviewed safety on earlier this year and brought this up\nThere have been all these lawsuits kind of alleging that discrimination against voucher holders what do you say to that uh\nTo live where their support group for their family is where transportation one of the job is\nWe spoke to more than a dozen Dr holders and none of them told us that Andrew told Stacey hunt about Denise\nShe just heard from dozens and dozens of landlords you know like sorry we just don't accept section eight is discrimination or ... or stereotyping at least part of what the issue\nOf books reflects because everyone has to deal with real very stringent fair housing requirements all across this country\nStacey told Edgar there are plenty of legitimate reason Texas landlords don't take vouchers the section eight program is run by government agencies that don't have enough staff and they're known to cut checks late Stacy says this kind of hurt uh landlords bottom line and they shouldn't be forced to deal with it but he did have a suggestion for Denise\nFrom sue for this lady that I Would have to close to people in this quest\nNest class\nWe heard that name a lot during our reporting the bureaucracy affectionate is so bad Houston officials created an entirely new nonprofit last year to help deal with it and wanted to see if nests quest could really help people like to me so I'll let him take it from here\nHere in town that quest work they find landlords in areas with high rated schools who don't take vouchers then they make a pitch let the family with a voucher live here and we'll deal with the government for you\nOn time rental payments those are automatic\nWe ought to secure all the utilities for the unit Blair and not have to do anything this Isabel Lopez executive director of nest quest and we also guaranteed a to point will maintain runners insurance on the unit [noise] um and then a tiny little about we are willing to fit the bill for any damage in\nWhen Isabelle took this job not quite cut a one point two million dollar grant bent\nGoal helps three hundred and fifty families with children moved to neighborhoods with top rated schools\nI was extremely optimistic easy like I don't see anybody saying no today and the first time we actually had his heart talking to landlord would honestly it was really discouraging\nTo the fact that under no question that landlords have very little financial risk and yet they're still so cautious of the program does that suggests that there's but there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nExactly what that suggests and I hate to say that but it I mean it is a reality of what it is right now\nI think that everything is going to take care of and it still that hesitation and I don't want to work with someone who was on sex and [noise]\nI Lived in mid October only Seventeen families without yours are renting places but not quite help [noise]\nFive of them are staying and properties managed by the company they the hunt worked for that sort of thirty eight thousand units whose company managers and the Houston area\nFive out of thirty eight thousand I talk to you about this you know seems cold comfort to somebody like Denise\nWhere it's just it's a real mix her room when bill to the day I mean we're we're trying the industry's Troy\n\nIn July and three months after we first met Denise she would still looking
