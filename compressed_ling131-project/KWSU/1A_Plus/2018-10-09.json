A. M. U. dot org speaking of the world of work there's been some breaking news this morning about a woman who is choosing a new job and is resigned from our current position\nNikki Haley America's ambassador to the United nations announced her resignation this morning\nHaley is formerly the governor of South Carolina has somewhat international reputation for being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on anything but it's on everything but since there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShe'll also be remembered in part for striking back in\nAnd she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get or if you don't get to fuse she and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared ... is a\nGenius that no one understand I mean to redo the NAFTA deal the way he did um what I'd done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably well done and an office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the thing\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're that our country because there and\nUm that had ministry and you also just have to say I'm certainly thank you to my family my ... at the same and um my two little ones I adore them entertained us un you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time\nAnd energy into it um but they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make America proud and so with that I'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good slate and on for the next disaster to come in but now\nI don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was I was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand year fly to church shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then to come in\nAnd did years have Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to be dealt with enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so they seem to prefer to live in\nSay that um if our own here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty I can promise you what are we doing it for that point so I look forward to supporting the president and the next election\nBut as Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations speaking just a few minutes ago at the White House announcing that she will be resigning from that post back now with our conversation with ... brown and maybe by way of a transition\nWe should get to an email from Hillary who says I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed the work environment have you noticed a difference\nUp so I absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune from the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen increased polarization in our families in our neighborhoods among our friends is at work\nPeople have to be careful and especially when there's power differential and it it's I I actually the latest became a pretty significant source of anxiety at work and home\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of these other dividing line\nYeah cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural today where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nTowards the I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to kind of open up if that ... toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just need to be this one person I Need to keep my head down and get to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we started talking about emphasizing and being vulnerable and being open and compassionate and ... opens the door for me to say something about how I voted or you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love that is going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of less\nI think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I'd never seen anything meaningful are significant come from mouth shut had down\nIn my career that's just not how we make contributions\nAnd so what we have to do is learn how to\nListen talk here each other and rumble and we use the term rebel because it really feels like a rumble rumble with their Boehner ability or seen other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle it's a foundational skills that\nI don't think spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives and armor\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high\nAnd we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experience as all of who you are to address the problems\nFrom reading your book and based on the research that fuel to book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a scar yeah you know ... ...\nI think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really it was actually voided my hypothesis going in so Dr\n... yeah yeah it just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at guessing what I'm going to find but not in this case so we asked a hundred and fifty see that all leaders that there is there a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred and fifty sea level global leaders\nThree years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are and these were NBA an MBA students at Wharton Kellogg Rice University and then\nTons of data valuation data to I thought when when when it was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need brighter leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fair\nBut then we went and talked to several daring leaders and sad so you're not afraid very often and they like\nI'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long as I said that blew my hypothesis that fear being the greatest barrier to during leadership the greatest barriers a daring leadership is armor\nIt's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger\nThat having to be the nowhere and get everything right instead of being the learner and so really you know and it's interesting what you said about scars intend to places not only does armor\nKeep other people from seen us an sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear\nAnd less it faster and grow\nAnd metastasize so we need to create were cultures were armor is not rewarded or needed\n[noise] we are some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left in our inbox first let's hear from Adam\nMy name is Adam and I'm calling from Nashville, Tennessee I'm a paramedic and fire fighter and it was such a definitely feel like I Need to do my job politically at all times just because there are definitely times one lives livelihoods or on a lot of jobs on the other hand\nI worked for a department that's very good about just order just as well and my co workers and I definitely do a good job of trying to share and better get stressed\nOut I'm thanks very much for calling and sharing your story with us no contract Adam's story which is rebels story she works\nAnd it's just really hard to suggest that anyone to feel safe there you have to watch everything you stay in jail and there's so many corporate compliance policy I Would say it's not a safe place to be human at all\nIs it do we appreciate your sharing your story as well bringing it sounds like a failure one might think that being in one of these high pressure leadership environments would lead to more common experiences with both of these folks are in places where laws are on the line with wildly different experiences what's the variable that makes a difference there\nThank you\nProviding customized insurance for small

P. in the app store\nAnd we'll share some of your stories on Monday when our series this state we're in continues on one day\nBack now to our conversation with burn a brown author of the new book dear to lead with regards to arm or a Monday sold emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually at the heart of this box these batteries are incredibly important [noise] um we need to find that very simply as what's OK and what's not okay until armor is not\nAbout professional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense as I Am going to put that protection as my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together\nTo the difference between [noise] so there's a difference between say armor and image\nSuch as kind of self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things in its it's on a more it's on a deeper level\nNow it's on a deeper into one of the greatest examples of armor armored leadership versus airing leadership has one form of armor we see a lot and folks\nIs the need to be right that it's that I got to be the network and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being learner and getting it right\nWe got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into work places and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which racial power structures and broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace\nDisproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor Cal punishing car tweeted\nAs a woman of color an immigrant in an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming distrust well here's what are the\nBiggest findings I think that\nOne of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the last ... and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic incident I mean racism homophobia poverty white supremacy I mean\nPrivilege does or does your everyday traumas and it is real that that that you know the armor that you need to survive this thing's Israel which is why it's leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThen we can't I mean gender is another you know I I think the kind of I needed help criticisms that happened after the forward testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during a way it wouldn't have got to\nDo was you know but absolutely vulnerability it can be used against us on and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core values and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some kind of mission statement or vision\nWorth nothing more than a paper on which is printed I work at some companies aren't going to some companies were the value stream it was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well what what what do you even start you suggest\nThat we should limit our core values to to just to end the lifting the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot of the list and I really struggled to Middletown delight to why only two well here's a\nBig operation allies values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating that you just really do have a cat poster\nI mean it really [laughter] it just really a poster so during the movie point in my head that little tone [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] you know and so what\nSo you know operation allies values into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that have taken the time to say you know what I some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in\nAnd so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data\nThat men and women\nWho had the capacity to be the most courageous can identify their values\nThey had two to three values and you know I have you know there's a long list in the book like we talked about and there's hardly Fifteen things on there that are important to\nMe altruism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independent self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I just probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to it my two Corvette my core values for me are facing courage and\nI Know those are the core values because it's a place where every other things on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we had a companion work buckets free downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational lives and and the behaviors\nUm he's changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them and then we have our company that\nLike for example one of our values just take the care taking care of each other our south and the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talk to people can either do it or you doubt\nAnd so I think it goes back to something we haven't talked about that as a real poor or finding which is courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught it's learning how to rumble the phone or do any living into your values which we're talking about right now\nIt's braving trust understanding how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nDo you need to declare its use our use I mean I I Would be fascinated to know what you live near I now think my to core values are because I Know what they are I went through the list\nI finally figured out my too but I don't know that anyone would guess what my two wars are based on who I Am the work I Do like I guess one sure catcher I sure OK\nFace no there is that what am I to call once but its encompassed in one of my two calls but no I Can't tell us what you too I don't

I Wonder if we do pick up with sets comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it's seems rare that officers are convicted after shooting someone under questionable circumstances what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the\nKey to all of this and that is that decision that the court made many years ago and the Graham case that basically said that when you are determining whether or not an officers engaged in the use of excessive force you must basically\nTake be in the seat that that the steps of the state of the officer so it's a very subjective standard what would a reasonable officer have\nDone in that situation so it is not an object that look is what is the officer feeling what is the officer seeing\nWhat is the officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do it as a result you find very few judgments first of all you know in in civil ensuing police departments are jurors have to again how\nHold the standard and prosecutors before they decide to to charge the officer have to look at the standard and say what would an officer reasonable officer in that situation have done\nSo it is the Supreme Court that has set this rule for\nAll law enforcement agencies in the country\nAnd they were over Eighteen thousand separate police departments throughout the United states they all have different rules but they are all under the umbrella of whatever the Supreme Court set of that is the rule that is out there now\nYou were by the way referring to the seasons Graham versus Connor Institute's from Nineteen eighty nine and some of you actually commented with regards to what's going on in officers mines like Peter Peter emailed\nIt seemed like to do with the mentality of police officers that their life is paramount beyond all else including their safety I feel like whenever they are threatened with any sort of possible harm to use deadly force in the new somehow justified\nThis is a career in which they signed up for similar to the military\nLet's add one more voice to our conversation before we get to some more of your comments joining us now on the line is Shannon Spalding\nChicago police officer who was also a whistle blower with in the department more undercover with the FBI Shannon welcome to the program I think he Joshua no I understand you had been working as an FBI informant within the department and as a result of what happened that caused\nSome of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you ... what happened that caused such stirred did it have to do with\nWith corruption inside the Chicago police department\n[noise] absolutely Joshua I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were\nActually involved and are running the narcotics trade with and the Chicago area and\nTherefore I began\nAnd operation dubbed operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers\nWho I used the term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed these officers one of them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department because\nBefore I came forward with operation brass tacks the code of silence\nWas unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist or they tried to label man it's crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nI Wonder why that is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer have law enforcement in my family but I've never taken an oath so I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider\nBut I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught I Would be grateful to see them go because they drugs all of us now why do you think it's not a similar mentality and law enforcement\nKill honestly a lot of police officers get approach man they still talk to me and you are correct on his police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt opposites\nPolice department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that officers actually fear what will happen to them if they break this code of silence and\nWhat was interesting to discover during this journey of\nBreaking the code of silence is that there is this common misconception that ate the blue officers blue shirt common St officers going against other officers when actually I learned that the retaliation came from the top down\nBosses were actually instructing the officers who were working with me not to back me up\nOr they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of fear of becoming me out of fear of retaliation and south or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them they complied because they it it's easier\nAnd easier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't want to they thought they had to I had officers come up to me and say you know I Believe in what you're doing but I Can't be seen talking to you because I'll be next\nWell let me let me play a clip from the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police Kevin ground this what do you have to say after the conviction of officer Jason Van Dyke this clip comes from WB use these podcast on the McDonald's case called sixteen shots here is Kevin ...\nWhat I Do I Do believe when some of the politicians over the last several years of use this case one thing and I want to remind everybody ran

for me but I Do kind of see what he's getting out and\nPrime time I mean it just you don't hear much of it do you think that Mr Graham has a point\nAbsolutely has a point I Do want to stay um most of

P.\nIn the app store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with meals Franklin Shannon Spalding Patrick Smith and judge la doors Cordell let's get some more of your comments before we start kind of looking forward it where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHey sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard we do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology\nToo many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun however Galvin had these questions Galvin writes\nThe question is what is reasonable\nDoes disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force there is a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot\nWhile they may be criminals or the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions to Cornell maybe you should respond a Galvin how do we suss out in a fine or sense what reasonable mess is\nOn us in the eye of the the holder it really has no one definition and what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes of the officer and what was the officers thing and\nIs not one definition of it but but I Do want us to\nGet to something you said Joshua about you know looking ahead I Believe it's time to read imagine policing in America\nPolicing in America today is is quasi militaristic and police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color and in low income communities that's not how policing started in this country\nPolicing started with individuals who lived in the community who knew everyone\nAnd they were people who were not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community and it has dramatically changed we have police departments\nArmed to the teeth with tanks\nAnd all kinds of of the equipment that uh are commonly used in the military and I think it's time to to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box\nWhy do we need police officers\nTo basically a patrol and and take care of traffic issues why can't that come from within the humidity why can't individuals' community members somehow ... ties to to deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMuslim and I will do and I'm I'm not disagreeing with your just by way of politics or some place where the lower level of sworn law enforce off or worse when officer does deal with things like parking enforcement and try to force them things that are less likely to required to force\nSure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic force and and they they do have a command structure and\n... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have of police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely\nI'm not opposed to criminal to criminal justice reform but look what happened we we get body cameras and what what happens while we have officers who oh\nDon't turn the cameras on or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order to get footage out on for example in liquid shooting so that that the whole lack of transparency\nPolicing for example has very little sunshine\nThere's very little sunshine and policing we don't get to know who these officers are their track records their history they're disciplined his\nLeft for us Ritchie who lives in Maryland lifted is in our inbox\nI talk to police both black and white and ah they seem to have this militaristic approach to the community I have had experiences where you know we just simply\nYou know I Would rather have conflict with a with community rather than actually serve it I really think that they should\nYou know take away the for the first couple of months but at least to buy cheap it's added a community without guns make 'em stay in the community to force them to have a dialogue with community I think it'd be a lot better uh which surf next me\nReggie thanks for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first\nIf we could contrast what Reggie said with another set of comments that we've gotten from some of our listeners like what scholar wrote scholar writes\nPolice put their lives on the line every day protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality involve people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law out convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nNeal what would you say to folks who said that police work is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to get home at night\nSo I Believe it was a veggie that left a message yes um you know that was such a brilliant comment because forcing the dialogue see when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving\nAnd you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge Cornell said um\nHow it used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors\nWhen something happens they support you when you had those relationships but when you have this occupying force will you know none of the people who are very few of the people were the ones that you do know there's conflict\nOn the under ... on the other end of that relationship that's a problem this goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget\nWhether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever with a community decides what's important with the community decides you know what we can handle these issues that the ground level we just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBut policing is very political political through the unions political through the mayors and governors and we'll never get to that place into the community to side and they come together and say we want control over our police departments and this is how we want to do it\nHaving that oversight at the beginning means that you don't need police review boards at the end when something goes horribly\nWrong is speaking of which we got some ideas from some of you about what could be done with regards to policing in review boards were part of it including a larger scale\nJamie asked shouldn't there be a national group or board who could provide oversight over individual police departments they could be an objective trusted advisory board who's judgments both sides would trust and accept and to whom aggrieved local citizens group could appeal\nPaolo tweeted police forces with their training transformed them from people's defenders into communities photos with this dance to police force is not your friend even if you or a regular law abiding citizen so maybe training part of it\nAnd Hector emailed the u._k. and other European Union countries have unarmed on duty police officers and we should have more on armed cops to", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018",
