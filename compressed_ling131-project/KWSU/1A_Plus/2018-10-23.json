U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one hey what's up with that title Trump the blue collar president I think it might be an odd image to call him blue collar considering everything in his house is\nI knew that the um the people on the on the left side of the political ledger would be upset with that title because Mr Trump has a gilded toilet and um the apartment looks like Louis the fourteenth smoke crystal meth and then decorated department so\nI knew that would upset them by some footage ... yes yeah but I but I but I I titled it that way because I grew up in a blue collar neighborhood I have blue collar parents that never went to college and\nMy dad had an hourly workers job when he got started in his career and and the people that I grew up with a really light come and they support him even to this day and so\nI think there's a message in the book as to why they do that I'm In and listen you know why I Try to open my mind up to everybody's fought and everybody's idea so I'm not close minded I understand the president has many flaws that I understand that people\nOn the side of the aisle that don't like him I understand why but I think the book has an important voice because the people on the other side of the aisle and don't like him I Would suggest that they read the book\nSo that they could get some sense for why he's at forty seven percent and climbing and why he's tightened up a um what could have been a blue wave you tighten up that race and made it a closer\nAre and why he's getting countless thousands of people to show up at his rallies I think what's important for people to lose to understand it well I I Will have to agree with that just hopefully they can understand well and I\nThink I understand where you're where you're coming from with that point it kind of\nIt makes me think about I don't remember if I don't know if you've ever seen Citizen Kane but if you think about the character of Charles foster Kane when he starts to go into politics part of what gives him a serious chance of winning and of course he he fails because of another scandal but it's this idea that he starts to articulate for people who feel like they're not\nBeing heard you can argue with his politics but just his ability to speak to people and have them go yeah what he said that's what we've been trying to get you to hear that kind of what I'm hearing from your argument that Donald Trump was able to articulate something that millions of Americans have tried I wanted to feel validated on for a long time\nNope no question I think I think that there is Liz pendant set working class middle class people lower middle class people have against the Washington establishment I think there's a series of complains where they feel that they've been under served\nMary Olympic things beginning in\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Fidel investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learn more it fidelity dot com slash wells fidelity brokerage services LSD\nAnd from ...

A. M. U.\nDot org Anthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from that\nSide of that ad acquaintance ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and out in times past and I always thought it was like a great publicity edge you see what a threatened to run you threaten to ... I had a run for president are are going to support Romney 'cause you know I've decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little short of about the words threatened not he floated the idea or he hinted at a rally threatens\nYeah that's a go go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president was sort of like that sort of a threat but uh\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person has a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature of the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your bottle you know so for me um I Love coming on NPR all go on left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews\nBecause I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said\nThat he spent a lotta time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that were very smart people on the other side and that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way\nIf I got to the other side and weaken my argument that I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going a lot of people out there that I disagree with\nFall with the press and the communications director where you tried\nTo convince the president to to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that\nIt it pushes back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive\nI hear you on that but the president didn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nYeah no no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know like if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there\nWas to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so\nHaving a free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power and that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications apartment on my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody lead did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press and servicing all parts of the press who didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything I only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call on CNN had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I want to send a message to those people that have we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room or open for business\nAnd you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I built my own business and you know it came from scratch so I went in the square ought to have to I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted to previous ban and out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly in the job\nIt was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president\nAnd even if I accepted a subordinate role which I have would have been happy to do it on a team player I don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality or does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly was like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ... having you know your General Kelly\nLike I I I I think those might be some\nIt's going to like me anymore and then he likes the president and all your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press he could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean I get the sense that the president just didn't agree with it [noise]\nUm no actually the you know such damage there is a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I'd been announced as a ... over a Tim in Iowa alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and says hey it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI look at what you declared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media for ... going to lose that war\nSecondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up ... because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well wait better served if we dial that down or any other thing is the president is a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him\nBut for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism will let him parity with Leslie stall let him have a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean if he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had him in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also\nA lot of people don't like the president's are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president so there was a lot of people inside the comp seems like okay we got to protect the president from him telling these like ... and him telling me up\nA story said on average ... may be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm On playing inaccurately and and clearly in consistently over look listen I just left a morning show where these guys like\nBut they they really want them all day and night and so and they're calling a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that and I understand if you're a military leader like someone who John Kelly that would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want all that stuff to be done\nYou've got to tell 'em straight yesterday man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he'll say back to you as well as energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote and and this is always going to be a battle as long as Donald Trump is the president United States it's going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and if you don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way\nThere are some people were the personality is actually outweighing the policy where they're like okay look I Can't take the personality even though the policies are good and let me get to a few more comments I Know we've only got you for a few more minutes but let me get to some more\nFrom our listeners Michelle is listening from

it's\nInteresting because you know when people hear a million you know I I never realized how much it decreases like if you take the cash option that Uncle Sam had hands out like I Need Fifteen times in that first year it just it really dwindled deal no\nPlease don't get me wrong I down and she was or not to tie and all that but uh [laughter] you know but I Will say that\nThe I ate it I'm not going to lie and say that it was a complete cars for my family and when I say my family I'm going to talk about my husband and my\nTwo daughters so in so many ways it was a blessing because our parents didn't share a small portion with my brother and I you know that means that my kids can literally cheese any\nPrimary and secondary education goal they well they go to any school for any amount of time they can do anything they want if you want to travel to Italy to study architecture because that sure drain\nDo it you know and that's an absolute blast that my husband and I both being

something to them before they bought it what what would you say\nIt would be the same thing that I Would tell\nAnyone who won tonight or if you want to ... million dollar one two billion dollars that doesn't matter I think it it's they absolutely need to heed the typical advice that you hear it you know surround yourself with a great tape a CPA a financial adviser and attorney but\nMy big advice

Gorbachev here is President Reagan at that meeting in Nineteen eighty seven\nThe importance of this treaty transcends numbers we have listened to the wisdom of in an old Russian maxim\nAnd I'm sure you're familiar with it too much Mr general\nSecretary don't my pronunciation may give you difficulty [noise] the maximum is do\nVi no pro vi trust but verify [noise]\n\nJeannie a pretty miserable day\nThe pattern every meeting [noise] from the meeting\nIn Nineteen eighty seven between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev give us a sense of the leadership styles of Reagan and Gorbachev that allow this treaty to come to fruition\nWell when you think of Ronald Reagan or you'd think of a man who is extremely decent\nAnd a conservative and Republican incompetent he was just a very competent person\nOr when you think of a Gorbachev he was a communist uh but overall a decent person who wanted to do something at that time they were both very different from the president we have now Joshua or in the sense that um [noise] you know when I was in government\nUh mothers and fathers wanted their kids to grow up like Ronald Reagan maybe not the policies maybe they didn't get rid of the policies but the decency the man the humbled and is the man the genuine niceness of him and today even if you're agreeing with Trump's policies\nDonald Trump or this is\nProbably sorry are probably some who city and openly quality and the president or whether they're hard to say\nThough there will disguise Joshua\nAnd uh the decency the kindness of Reagan who really loved immigrants and his office was decorated with pictures of immigrants his farewell address to the country talked about the wonders of wonderful immigrants coming to our country and his whole address was about immigration how wonderful it was\nHe was a fanatic about a free trade or not having terrorists at any time and he was very intense it's drying reduce government spending and reduce especially the deficit all those things were\nClassic conservative classic\nRepublican and um none of them are being followed by this so called Republican\nI'm Donald Trump's but anyway this style of Reagan was ... that made somebody like me very proud to I'm surfing and very proud to be there with him on that weekend and record back in Nineteen eighty six\n... author of Reagan Reykjavik forty eight hours that ended the Cold War also the arms control director for President Reagan and former U.S ambassador to the UN ambassador ... thanks for talking to us okay now learn how to spell Reykjavik aren't sure what I'll work on it I think very much very good bye [noise]\nWhat two Confederate General Robert e and the Reverend Dr Martin Luther king junior have in common\nAccording to retired General Stanley McChrystal they are both leaders worth studying granted we studied them for very different reasons but they did some of the same things\nThey made bold decisions that won them loyal following they were controversial within the very leadership structures that brought them into power and they are of veered today for what they represent it not just what they accomplished\nStill these men with several things in common which seemed to have almost nothing in common\nPerhaps that's the paradox of leadership\nThere's no one formula and no one checklist that defines all leaders Stanley McChrystal retired as a four star general he served as the top us commander in Afghanistan from two thousand nine twenty ten and he's the co author of the new book leaders miss and reality along\nJoshua we also like to take your questions in thoughts\nFor the general about the nature of leadership and we'd love to know to some of the leaders are that you look to that you try to emulate or is that you follow whose leadership attributes you think are worth highlighting comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one essay or email one a at W.

A. M. U. dot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage ... I ... I recall some people using the word leader\nAnd some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted if a quote unquote leader fails to leave but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear are they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in rules and people who get people to do things even though\nThat may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said or effective or not because you can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler\nIf we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous we think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders the dad retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one\nAnd yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then a short conversation he just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way he made me feel better\nI think we want our leaders to make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nYou can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who's a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent who pushes you to be better than you would otherwise be that military commander who works you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way but at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot\nBut typically they give along side to us and and if we we frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say our week demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask we answer many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through the one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textual right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors\nAnd their leader can use them and on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context has changed the followers are in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team and the situation\nThe second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them when you use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe it what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and I thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy because I was there and how would therefore be the star\nBut when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome and therefore thought I should get credit or blame for that but I found out all the other people had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that are played upon that\nWhen I concluded was the leader still part of it I mean I was still a key part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on a leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are the all the other things in the situation\nOr putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the leader of caused the great thing to happen or as Timothy responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nI Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney and there are some leaders who\nThe short films that led up to Snow White and the seven dwarves so he kind of kind of wanted it that way it's\nVery common I mean if you think about it everybody a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she\nDid an extraordinary job of pushing his team to create at a masterpiece he wanted the basket and that and it was a natural problem but it caused a huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWas speaking to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York the co author of leaders myth and reality that third myth you call the results mess which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter\nWill results matter and we claim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality the data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures\nOr their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are [noise]\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in a sin emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results than we think we are\nMarjorie emailed good leaders know how to train the next leaders and went to release the training wheels and step down I'm interested in March ... comic she's reflects something that a John Maxwell describes and the five levels of leadership basically the fifth level to the top two levels are about replicating yourself\nIn other people but I Wonder where you see that a lot of the leaders that you profile weren't necessarily looking to replicate themselves and others [noise] it it it\nSomething you don't see often enough Martin Luther king Junior's puppies success story there when he was murdered in Nineteen sixty eight the movement went on headed suddenly stopped in his loss than I think it would have said something\nOn the other hand if you look at Margaret Thatcher she was a very successful female politician in Britain in a tough time for a female politician she became the most famous prime minister since Winston Churchill she was extraordinarily
