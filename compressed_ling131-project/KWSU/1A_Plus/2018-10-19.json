Lee amplify that point Josh Record is absolutely critical and you know someone has been actually a very good on this and Senator Marco Rubio who made the point I'm paraphrasing here\nThat all the money in the world and all this military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalists for their opinions that's an international norm there's a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's like a critical one\nI mean the show is called ... for the first amendment ... that is in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world and if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a Senator Rubio said will never be able to buy our credibility back\nOn these issues Senator Lindsey Graham made a very similar point he would sell angry and he said I've been a huge ally as NBS in Saudi Arabia but I'm never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan issue\nThan have it is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published\nWhat is believed to be a multi ... final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and in Arabic and he writes about the systemic the systematic dismantling of the free press in much of the Arab world here's one brief quote from that column quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing ranked unquote Hayes what do you think is he right\nI think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region is that oftentimes strategic interests have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues\nUnder the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but if not indeed we never halted arms sales too\nThem over a there as you over their funding of hottest and other extremist in Syria we never have really taken very strong action against Saudi Arabia or any any country or any country in the region for their actions except for Iran who has been fundamentally aligned against the Gulf\n... a Gulf states so I I I completely agree with the sentiment in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nBefore it it's I Hope that we have the fortitude to actually the people in that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually passed some sort of legislation that or does something if the Trump Administration does not but it seems unlikely given the history of the issue\nSo basically the people who killed ... may get away with is that he may never really know who killed him there may never be any real prosecution because of just the cold hard fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis is a business relationship\nAnd you you've totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been wrote killers who took out to show he and reporting earlier this week that said that the U.S has actively working with the Saudi Government to try and come up with some sort of feasible solution that admits the data show gee but does not blame Mohammed bin Salman\nA coach or drop what can I come in on that because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to to Saudi Arabia wants to say that look\nUm you have to get out in front of this this is that you cannot swim to some of the rug I'm absolutely convinced we are going to get to the bottom of this because there's just so much evidence with the Turks now have\nThey've photographed these Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve and which part of the ... the crown prince of security detail or intelligence services I think we're going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a fall guy that somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that they'd be there to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral Ahmed Asiri as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to you know offer up a senior scapegoat but I'm I'm pretty convince we're going to figure out what happened here\nWhat we will keep an eye on this story we're glad to get some more of your comments on this for now let's move on to some of the other big stories that make news this weekend may have flown under your radar because of all the attention about ... G rightly given the course but there's also an update\nAgain with no clear end in sight\nYesterday the Taliban killed at leaving police chief in Kandahar the commander of us and NATO troops in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller escaped unharmed\nToday the Afghan government announced it's delaying elections in a province that we're supposed to take place tomorrow those elections will carry on a plan and the rest of Afghanistan despite widespread violence the Taliban have already killed at least ten candidates and scores of voters\nIn the ... give us some sense of how the Taliban's efforts might affect the outcome of this election voter turnout the reliability of of the results what's the the kind of upshot\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from ... am committed to changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day nine hundred franchise locations matinees him dot com slash NPR\nFrom logged me in makers of go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform that comes equipped with features to help people stay focused to get work done and learn more it goes to meeting dot com\nAnd from the listeners support this NPR station\nBack now to the friday news roundup with James kid field at the center for the study of the presidency and Congress in the ... of the Boston Globe and the Pulitzer center and have brown of buzzfeed news still a little more time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from around the world one eight at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThis week some Americans were probably green with envy and our neighbors to the north\nRight out gotten I've\nA guy that\nThey were celebrating in Montreal this week because on Wednesday Canada legalize recreational marijuana nationwide it's only the second country in the world to do so why was the first\nIn twenty Thirteen Andrew tweeted\nCanada legalizing we'd with like California legalizing we'd both for like a long relationship where you've been dating forever but just now made it official Hays how big a deal is this and do you think this is the start of a Global Trends something that has just kind of been understood for a long time and just hasn't been made official\nYet [noise] you know that's a great question because I'm not really sure I mean I think that when you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal\nThat at first you compare that to things like the way and offer the drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that it you know marijuana is that evil so it's really tough to tell where the global feeling is\nOn we legalization if um you weren't you bring it up they add a meeting in the European Union's\nOf European Parliament than I'm guessing you still would not have been nearly a majority of people in favor it even in a place like the ...\nControlling the access to marijuana which it it is doing now compared to you know being a private business\nUh that private but illegal business among many small dealers\nOr it depends on how it affects the global drug trade and whether\nUh there's going to be any sort of shift and you know I'm sure that Ken is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether caused the surge and traffic accidents where the cause asserted tops realization or medical effect so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada\nYeah the CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police the are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't driving stone it is of course worth noting\nThat in this country marijuana is considered the most illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there\nWith heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use and the high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd Owen who was in the fish will with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all and in the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's caught or one of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues that the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing the math to a to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was is updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things packed them on to NAFTA and set it snapped a to point out but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know that people are saying that essentially this is a potential marijuana mass right now I'm so I think this could be an issue because we certainly did not have legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis\nI Wonder also dreams what other kind of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean Justin Trudeau now has to kind of own this whether it's seen as a ...\nIt's interesting because the me too movement really kicked off here in the United states a year ago and for a while uh I Know that our reporters at least for watching Indian waiting and wondering when is it going to affect this culture where\nUh we were so sure that it would finally have an impact and now a in recent weeks has finally like grabbed the country and shaking at\nA we Steve is all started with one actress to a one Bollywood actress coming forward and just it's been a tidal wave of accusations sense than women taking to Twitter and being unafraid to name their alleged abuse abusers and altered by name\nAnd just being really willing to step out and do what the Indian courts haven't done before which is try to bring these men into account\nAnd um it it's really interesting that ... one of the first to go considering um she had such a long run in the Indian journalism tea and ... and\nUh the most women who came forward about him were fellow journalists were fellow reporters so I feel like that is a bit of credence to these allegations and we'll see whether in the future they uh the the women who are I guess lower down on in social status will finally start to be believed as well\nWith regards to the protests of the ... temple and Carol estate the BBC's dreams Clinton was they're asking people why they were protesting here's what one man said\nNo no no no no I wouldn't want to know the media and making them they don't really\nWant to do this don't underneath religion that's the only thing these\nSome of what the BBC's James Cleveland was told in Carol estate outside the ... temple there in the ... I Wonder what your sense is of this protest particularly what the gentleman said it made it sound as if there's this external pressure from the media and politicians they want to destroy our culture they want to destroy our religion\nSays well obviously that's not true let's say I mean at at the most obvious part of that is that ... Modi who is the prime minister of India is from a fairly far right Hindu nationalist party so he's clearly not trying to destroy their culture and religion this is a historic Supreme Court

use White House correspondent for McClatchy and Alexandra Jaffe a correspondent for vice news tonight on HBO we'd love to hear from you about this week's big story so comments on our Facebook page where you can watch video stream\nOf your comments including some of your commenting about this Elizabeth Warren's story Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes me angry or makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren released this DNA result he showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing the story\nBeat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to end these comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in front of the of the arguments that what fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that what could help Republicans on sort of succeed in the midterms\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the high road still seems to be that static but we'll see how things play out\nThere you go ahead for like a it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandros saying look this is what happened to two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio jaded or\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook 'em out um and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and that's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff\nWe'll give you the way in which um you know the parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up the elections are founded telling that the gifts that they brought up\nA typically these would be people you know on presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been you know story Dennis Miller Michael ... an Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've the people who've drawn the most attention to the people who have cast themselves as Trump antagonist and\nThe the midterms of up here because they're both sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week he democratic he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nPeople are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at what point at one point Franco or Joni as what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\n[noise] um you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races ... it's been the most fascinating race probably a throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot a for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know try not to say too much about\nA cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's he's had to take a new tack\nUsing this language of lion tad um attacking them about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas on it's been a major shift in tone for work but it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with\nJust yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants\nA you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for Beto O'Rourke some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexander I was going to ask you whether or not or what you read was on whether this could work I mean ... I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether\nThey rather progressive Democrat like over ... has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved the needle it'll\nProbably it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in terms of typically you know not that many voters\nThat significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which\nI don't like Sunday of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think\nAnd under covered aspect of this race is the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go in and market box for Republicans\nAnd the strength of the Republican Party over all the strength of Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running against Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties and seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even as better over arc\nHad been able to keep them to think that\nI was going to make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ... and says Republican and it automatically counts that vote dress counting for all the Republicans on the ticket\nYet you can basically do for every Republican all at once I'm this is the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that it won't be as easy\nWill fundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they were doing Monday and the results\nLooked pretty good for Democrats and house races or at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fund raising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers\nOut raised Ninety two Republican incumbents more than six the Democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars a quarter in the Senate Democrats are also out raising Republicans Beto O'Rourke raised thirty million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races also glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas\nKaren tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nThere are still people missing there's still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think the town and Mexico beach has not reported given any numbers um\nHundreds I mean this was a massive storm I'm Talking about one of the biggest storms out of the top three or perhaps by some accounts that you know had made landfall that would make it bigger than Katrina this has been a huge effort many people still do not thousands still don't have a phone service\nUm and people are expecting asked film is sewn services restored and more roads are clear it and you're able to get more to people that they're expecting the death toll to continue to rise\nWhen Alexander the other big issues when people can actually start to rebuild I mean it's it's fascinating and terrifying horrifying at the same time to look at some of the early drained camera pictures from where hurricane Michael came ashore from where it made landfall\nYou can almost tell which homes were built up to the latest building codes and which ones were not because the homes that were up to code words there and the whole word were gone and I wonder what points the the ... the rebuilding effort is right now is there any effort is there any expectation on when people could start to rebuild\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy home insurance with their home quote explorer tool custom quotes and rates are available online learned more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nAnd from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed of financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement more ad alliance for a lifetime income dot org\nBack down to the friday news roundup with Josh Rogers Alexandra Jaffe and frankly or don't is still a little bit more time to get in your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from across the country one a ... W. A. M. U. dot org Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire\nThe race in district one will be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress\nHis Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district that Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen right\nTrading him a party to party from two thousand eight or the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats winning in presidential years is now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's\nRetiring I'm In ... where do you have people who are running really within the mainstream of their parties a path posters been serving in various\nElective offices for a long time he's in his late thirties he family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester often stop for presidential candidates he um he comes from Manchester which is a town where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative\nWho has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time all ... states ah enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores liquor is controlled by the state uh it was a fairly big job he of ram enforcement division and he's been a police chief\nUm you know they were pretty much keeping to well within the norm to their party Eddie Edwards is you know embrace Donald Trump he every Giuliani up here campaigning with them [noise]\nUm and he's in some ways trying to cast Chris Pappas those you know part of some sort of resistance movement and saying we've got to see the nationally uh you know Chris Pappas as you know hardly a radical guy or you know family um rod restaurant ah worked I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um\nAnd uh this race so he was one where the seat can go either way and uh both parties believe they have a shot\nThere is also a gubernatorial race underway here at the Republican government Governor Crist new new\nFaces Democrat Molly Kelly she's won a Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number the latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that Kelly the Democrat has outraged Sununu the incumbent Republican\nThree to one uh ... brand of New York came to conquered on yesterday to help a campaign for Kelly\nThey met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave I'm interested in where in this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but but here as part of what happened was here ... listen\nIt's going to help families here and how it's going to help people be more productive at work and sell\nIt can win win everywhere I go in that state I hear about the need for paid family medical leave and how important it is for us\nTo be able to have the choices in their life to be able to work hard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they love the most when they're needed them out\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator ... brand was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is is paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will it's\nBeen a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test me she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue um it's a challenge to somebody covering the story of how many stories one can write about paid family leave by understand\nHe was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it at the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction amounted to an income tax which you know it was real fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax [noise]\nUm you know the Democrats believe this is a need for that works for Mali Kelly by dint of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who work your way through college and that you know Christian new new sort of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh\nYou know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get at New Hampshire has kind of a bifurcated economy and\nUh you know boom times for people the upper income we have budget surpluses and tax collections are up but you know the wage growth for people at the lower end of the scale\nHas not been great and this is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race\nWell I'm you know Sunni should win or do we have to your terms here no governor's been tossed after one term\nUh since two thousand four and part of that it had been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those\nUh here polling indicates that the new news up by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers in Mali has outrageous Christian in his three to one and the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch of this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he will freely admit he doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only got he's got four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand you know interest groups will will add to that in terms of advertising but\nThis is a race said Democrats feel they have a chance to win if if a blue wave a venture weights and they think that Molly Kelly or buy dinner background by the end up being a woman is somebody who perhaps his best engineered to kind of ride away speaking\nOf nationally known names Frank or don't is I Wonder what your senses of senators your brand making his trip to help Mali Kelly is there's speculation about her future maybe in twenty twenty\n[noise] there's a lot of speculation about her future and twenty twenty um I think how much is it kinda resonate as as the big question I mean obviously I there's so many names being kicked around ah right\nThat people are talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move or that she makes 'em is being picked apart um you know analyze a and looking for it how it could mean and how it could uh what impact that could have on twenty twenty\nLots to discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because the Treasury Department revealed this week but the deficit has grown\nLast year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred and sixty six billion this week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars\nIt's a six year high end projection say it is on track by the end of this decade to ... a trillion dollars the deficit a trillion dollars\nNow Alexander some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being responsible for this particularly\nThe tax bill part of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts is it by cutting taxes business what kind of unleash more productivity the economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest would more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out so far\n... well we haven't seen that yet certainly an advantage Republicans are arguing that that's going to take 'em you know about a decade to even out do\nAt this rate although the economy is booming there's ... there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at at this point um it was sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around was welfare reform\nUm to to cut down on the deficit and that conversation has started again on Capitol Hill\nI'm that obviously won't move forward until after the midterms but there is conversation about to get you know starting to work on a welfare reform bill that would cut some public benefits um like Medicare that kinda thing\nUm and sell going forward you know it's interesting they care or to the Republican silence on this issue when they were previously the party of deficits but it's also an opportunity for them politically to push another priority of the Republican Party which again is welfare reform\nYeah I'm Glad you mentioned that because Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blamed the rising deficit on public assistance programs in an interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday what's\nOn with that is very disturbing it's ruined the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid Seventy percent of what we spend every year", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Pullman", "day": "19"}
