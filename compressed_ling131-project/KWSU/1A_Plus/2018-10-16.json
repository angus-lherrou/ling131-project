about the threat from cyber attacks and we know that some hackers are hell bent on stealing our secrets so\nNow might be a good time to go check your Facebook account the most recent hack of the social media giant compromise about thirty million users names phone numbers emails and other personal details\nFacebook says last month attackers found a vulnerability in the code and use\nYou love right in without having type your password every time it gave them whoever they are access to nearly everything your user name which devices you access Facebook with the last ten places you checked into or were tagged at\nAnd personal details that you posted like your religion your home town your birth date where you work yeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account\nNow the company and the FBI or try to catch these hackers and this year Facebook's chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress that his company needs to raise its game\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good the connector and people can do and if Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love for making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections than hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and at the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica ... she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions as new post everyday eyes to the first thing they become aware is if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the site if you do it comes through in its reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might foreign policy so for instance terror propaganda now we remove the terror propaganda that we've removed from face that's more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flagged for us\nNow once content has been flat as potentially violating our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on the content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages [noise]\nUh and making a decision if it violates the policy and ... if it doesn't violate the policy they'll leave it up that's got to\nBe a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the at the city\nDegree of language expertise we have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire hunting reviewers who speak a different kind of language is and it's important to us that we have\nNative language speakers because they really understand the way that language is used so that's a big focus in our hiring once you're hired as a content reviewer you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in one\nSo for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm threats of self harm\nWhen you catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook and violated the terms what's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it\nIs the kind of thing that say a reviewer or bought would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook deals with us we\nStill rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on a site that said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag violating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well in a couple of areas where it's harder\nAreas where it's working really well with terror propaganda I'm with child sexual exploitation with them with fake account we now have technical tools that can flag the vast majority of that content before anybody in the community\nSend it to us or sees it at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery or terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody into obscene\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very contextual\nFor instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the words I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns how does that pattern recognition work where we do some most of our policies are about contests\nFor instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we will remove your account even if you're not otherwise pilot in our content policies we also have policies against terror organizations and our members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance want it to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens and rain does we would still remove it because we don't allow those groups or anybody representatives groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning at the page that's represent an al ... page that has been created for the purpose of bullying somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us\nThe reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that's going to come through in our review teams first and so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that's what's going to come through our reviewers and they'll be able to take immediate action\nAlso worth noting if you're a mobile use or like if if you're an iPhone use or if you just hop on a comment directly sometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or lay copy and then there's other options and in those other options there's an option to report somebody I Wonder\nHow much Facebook is facing the learning curve of a world as learning to use Facebook know decides designed to be intuitive I think it is increasingly intuitive the more you use it\nAnd because you're global you've got people in some parts of the world who are just beginning for the first time to have broadband devices or to be connected to a world where there are more devices in our people house Facebook teaching people to use Facebook\nWe definitely do outreach but you're right at different in different parts of the world people will have different levels and experience and finding these reporting options and even just understanding how this works\nSo we actually do the options that we offer people to report content actually do vary by location and we're always testing ways to get\nMore report to us to make it easier now there's a tension here if you just have one big red button and people can present whenever they want that to things happen one is that people might report things when what they really mean it just to hide it and get the content away from them because they don't like that person\nAnd the other thing that happens is we don't have enough information about the post to routed to the correct reviewer right away so you'll notice when you report something on Facebook we ask a couple of questions not many but a couple of because we want 'em to find\nHaving to start finding contractors or get

thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with us Paul I wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add or comment the terminology often gets us in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this\nIt's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions with a policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to ... global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of Americans\nOne party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty two year period that elected president who almost campaigned

Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much she won't consider that just maybe there is a greater sing at play here\nWhat is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening changed the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation nurturant Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she then and the last that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and you know this is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me\nLike six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it\nPeople can get exposed to the the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think is through and through relationship and trust and empathy um because as we interact at individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis\nYou can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger\nUm [noise] I ... all of these pieces that are we all shied away from those very challenging emotions and often when we fielded in motion ... into our part in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing worldview\nHaving this conversation is one of the way to start\nIf I could just doing it a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak\nTo the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean it's hard not to read the latest report from the un climate change panel which we discussed last week on this program\nAnd not feel like well we're all going to die anyway why bother run up your credit because they're not going to be around and collect you know what I'm saying like it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder is maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long way when I when\nI ... yeah I get it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we sit\nWith the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that we're living a science fiction and fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us\nAnd specifically in the U.S [noise] Native American and indigenous Native American people\nWho have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at down the line and ... that the consequences from climate change we can look at the stories of human tenacity\nAnd how people struggle and survive through massive massive chef we know these stories and we can inform our strengths and resilience and our courage by looking at the stories of for example the water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now saying\nThe earth is precious we only have one planet and we're all going to show up and\nI'm informed that the you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place and and things vigilant shot I Would\nJust go ahead go ahead but oh I Would just add that\nThe St Louis is a reasonable reaction if you don't know the full range of solutions\nThat there's a lot of good news here two years ago\nWe eliminated one of them six main greenhouse gases it will no longer exist on earth Twenty years from now with the golly agreement to phase out HFCs\nTurns out there three or four other super pollutants like methane and black carbon if we can reduce these quickly about three times the current rate we can limit near term warming and prevent Reynolds\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from logged me in makers have go to a meeting a collaborative meeting platform was over Eighteen million monthly users designed to connect

thinking skills for thousands of students every day in nine hundred franchise locations math navy um dot com slash NPR\nWe get back to our conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program about being Native Americans\nMassachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along that she is indeed of tribal heritage the test was the clock back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders said direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard it's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters talking head of the midterms\nIf you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant to you what tribe or are you part of and how does that factor into your life\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a you know if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life what did you discover and how did it change you\nTell us your story eight five five\nTo three six one a one way or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Sarah ... and Paul blood so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on Noel\nGoing and too much shuts down and drains you need to keep it at that middle area I guess let's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and the poll I Wonder if you could respond to her Arlene rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not\nOurs no doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical\nWhen you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take large policy action to reduce emissions in the United states in globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have to the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who\nAcknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida um but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation and useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few common objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond\nTo that well I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] they had to have it in that um that ... those protections are coming through I mean all of that pieces of protection that we have\nDo a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there's so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season out of different places are influenced\nBy the day that the um the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why\nAnd people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for earth planet has been ... oscillation between glacial an inter glacial state abrupt warming into enter glacial\nFollowed by slow cooling into glacial state so that ... thing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structured that was fundamentally paste by the changing geometric relationship between the earth and the signs\nOf Sarah back up along the changing geometric relationship between glacial and enter glacial stayed last me it's so cool it's amazing what it's confusing like like bring it down to earth from it\nOkay so in the ... million years that the planet's climate has been moving between glacial state\nWhere there's an ice on top of North American and you're Asian continent sea level is lower um it's a colder climate um and then in ... states so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis on this piecing that I'm ... ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and the heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat with paste by the way goals and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth killed as it moves around\nDone so I Want to make sure all fall and you're just yeah heartbeat this earth heartbeat between poll too warm\nCold War it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest heartbeat as off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that what you're saying that's exactly right I like ... okay that makes youthful\nPattern that's been a ... that's been happening for the last ... million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed\nThe fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof and um the climate system can't take that\nForever that will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and then we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many case if they're under stating the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed up a degree and a half Fahrenheit were on her way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that that's just the factual information I I I think we were very few people actually denied about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the u._s. public actually\nDenied climate science would I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action\nPublished so former climate advisor for the Clinton White house process or your lecture at American University Center for environmental policy\nAt a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute Paul thanks very much for talking to us thank you judge them and Sarah ... research associate at the University of Washington and founder of the ... Institute Sarah thank you you're so welcome\nThere are good reasons to be concerned about our politics the division the tribal ties that seem to get in the way of finding agreement and compromises we just discussed\nBut we're not alone no matter how fraud things maybe come here between now and the midterms at least we're not trying to work out a divorced that's lasted more than forty years and that will probably cost about fifty billion dollars\nNations on any", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "16"}
