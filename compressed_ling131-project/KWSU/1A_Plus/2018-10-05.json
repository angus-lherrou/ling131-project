{"month": "10", "state": "WA", "station": "KWSU", "content": "\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where a dramatic vote has just taken place in the U.S Senate and the nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and the west\nSyria was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nUnder the age of fifty one that knows are forty nine the motion is agreed\nTo fifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that time fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one\nDemocrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate to kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as long as as well as anyone and she is in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving who's covered politics for very long time as well\nGood morning to get both in mourning mourning say thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama of the last couple of weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice\nPresuming that Kevin I'll get through as we got through the vote today\nHow has the U.S Supreme Court to different court that it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\n[noise] well I was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump picked from his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man that is being replaced\nAnd that will kill to court that was sort of like a balance sports sometimes\nMainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time in some of those very big cases going the other way to the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the voters five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and\nThey may move on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to and to um to take on\nLegal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nAgenda and argued that conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would be don't even this\nTerm which is so far pretty doggy term frankly with not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to and the rest yet to come\nThere is three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding precedence so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the left you could be blocked or you could be suddenly find as people are now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question if arbitration\nSaid to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in it and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that Annette ...\nShip that example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety of cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights\nAnd and and many other things\nLet's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave a speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying the nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a\nSo that a minority cannot block a action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there've been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes one of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nAnother one being Susan Collins of Maine\nWho issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that she spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins of Maine but what you said out to ... to a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor is that I'm voting yes\nThe day what I'm going to do later on what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works right Ron opening\nIt is but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and why ... why would you do that\nWell that the justification that people put forward is they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have similar floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't\nAnd at the end of that we should be fair enough to this candidate to give him a final vote on the floor now I plan to vote no but I think he should have that final vote on the floor\nShe has not said that let's be fair which she did not say that and and I think there'd be an awful lot of folks who'd be very surprised if tomorrow she votes no but she has that option\nShe may I don't think she's actually\nAbout who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure that she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a time when the rules were different when that sort of thing would happen you get sixty votes for cloture then maybe only fifty two votes to pass and they're even had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote\nAnd win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with a filibuster\nOkay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who was a no vote at least on cloture Susan Collins of Maine who is a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today\nHer decision on the final vote and then there is a Republican who is never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the facts free verdict of the mob and the media would wet out over the actual\nEvidence made sure the mob prevail\nAbout the uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say\nAround here the Senate while the files or\nThe Senate is not quite have the final say but they got to step closer to a day with his fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering and that we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now ... is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name\nNews of the fifty one forty nine votes to advance Kevin\n[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch as you guys have been talking about that she was actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch over the next twenty four hours a and they are the um [noise] uh Susan Collins a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock mhm\n[noise] but uh you know she might be actually trying to\nUh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know you deserve the vote I'm going to vote no but he deserves about that could be possible I think that's likely about possible and the other person is Joe Manchin who\nI think Democrats are probably split and whether or not they're surprised a an his vote today\nA to a his vote for cloture hum but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now uh if if I were a betting man I Would probably bad for narrow confirmation tomorrow but what those two senators do over the next twenty four hours is going to tell us everything we need to know\nI Want to note there are so many layers to this story there is the question of Senate votes there is the broad question of policies that could change laws that could be interpreted or\nReinterpreted as Nina Totenberg has been discussing and then there's the reality of politics we're deep into an election campaign where it is seen as possible that one or plausibly although it's a long shot in both\nHouses of Congress could slip and we have mentioned in our live coverage here\nThat there are about ten Democratic senators\nWho were seen as vulnerable representing states that voted for President Trump and now up for reelection\nThemselves nine of them chose to vote against this nominee even though it was perceived as potentially politically damaging to them I Want to I'm going to bring the medical model now our political editor into this conversation in a moment but let me ask you first Mr realizing\nIs is northwest public broadcasting it's eight Nineteen this is special\nCoverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where we had been listening\nIn the last little while to a historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate the vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end debate\nAnd then the final vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage than they would on ending debate as a matter of fact one Senator Susan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance denomination but that she would give a different statement sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock\nAs to what her actual vote would be on the floor tomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes\nThat the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote for a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominees even before there were allegations of sexual assault and then\nSchumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break in Schumer's word in terms of doubts\nSome of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said they were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine Blasey Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh has a friend looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine is devoted let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican months' NARAL can start us off in this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything that surprised here here to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kind of independence she shown over the years this is somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate to beat the odds of doing that anywhere are nearly impossible now a lot of Alaska well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because\nShe's very well known names and yeah and not as many people as a you know some of the other states\nSo she was able to pull that off my point about that and that she doesn't all Republican leadership anything so when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profile in courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought could be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion\nOr because of the politics of either their pockets of with a Collins or of their state with Joe man and woman\nSay profile in courage were just defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody behind the state\nWell at that time that NATO sex would suggest that not as a Democrat ... pro democratic thing I mean that somebody who would bug do with their voting rights go against their base so when you think about um what we what we have left though given that Murkowski voted no on culture\nIt's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor later when it comes to the actual final vote\nThat leaves us with the pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia these three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mentioned\nFor reminding us one could peel away and it wouldn't be an outright still be fifty votes it'd be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie\nThere were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just the senators on the floor but protesters outside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters\nCommunity service out of the ...

try to\nGet in front of a Senator Lisa Murkowski or to try to influence her vote if that uh there was a group of a number of them met with her yesterday and ah they were trying to make sure that she

senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen\nJoining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon host and senior producer at Nevada public radio Joe\nHi how ya doing

Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college became a computer programmer and then she got on to the national scene really by surprise\nWhen former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she won and twenty sixteen beating Danny Tarkanian in a really close race\nAnd we remember that Harry Reid represent\nOffensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable gum be type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equate that to Dean Heller\nThey call him senator or somebody because Dean Heller beds with the political when first promising to vote against the plan to repeal Obamacare because it would hurt in Nevada Dean Heller from Nevada today no\nYou're right now actually supported the wishes of Nevada
