the\nDetails began a parent and media we after the incident really is it it it it's not known or it's not clear\nBut you know he won heard by witnesses and did according to a complaint later tell swat officers who are removing him from the scene you know yelling very anti Semitic clearly anti Semitic messaging including\nAll Jews must I Am going to kill all the Jews and that's reflected in his social media posts those immediately before the incident\nAs well and stretching back a good way but we do know that he was of that ideology uh but the investigation is really still ongoing the site is still closed due to forensic investigation and the FBI and in other enforcements really still screening through his social media posts and conducting interviews in the lake so we'll learn more details without sort of come out\nHouse the city of Pittsburgh coping with all this right now the mood like into [laughter]\nIt's a blue collar placed right like the real tough place and I think that that's become very very clear in recent days the communities come together\nUm it's it's tough it's a tragedy that and\nObviously most directly impacted our Jewish community but that doesn't mean that everyone has been really rallying behind that she went to support those who are most directly affected we've seen that in a vigil the night of the shooting in which thousands came out to this girl hell neighborhood to to mourn together\nIndividual last night an interface gathering thousands and thousands more overflowing outside into the reign of\nMuslim Christian Catholic faith all really rallying together and really putting up a tough front here as we have to just truck on\nTell us more about the neighborhood where this happened squirrel she'll give sprint is a picture of squirrel ...\nRight I mean if they'd be a beautiful picture to paint right at the tree lined neighborhood it's it's one of the larger residential neighborhoods in Pittsburgh I'll be at a very urban you know just a few\nMinutes from the downtown core of the city um but it's traditionally the hub of Jewish life here in the city and that visually appearances well there's\nA synagogue it you know there's multiple synagogues within just a few square miles it's home to one of the country's largest Jewish population\nThey're kosher Delhi's but there's also some like really great Chinese food my favorite French bakery and so it's really known as being a diverse place with roots dating back to the you know pre civil war times but then of course during the Nineteen twenties when we saw flocks of Eastern

for something that came up earlier we had a comment referring to one of the victims of the shooting in Pittsburgh referencing her as a Holocaust survivor one of the victims who was Ninety seven years old rose Mao injure there's been some reporting on this road\nThere was a Holocaust survivor who was on the scene and narrowly escaped being caught up in the mass shooting ... it\nWas a few minutes late to synagogue that day but was in the area of the tree of life congregation in Pittsburgh when the shooting took place or just want it to correct that before we move on again this is a fast moving breaking story best to keep an eye out on NPR dot org for the very latest or on your NPR member station [noise]\nHow do we prevent accused sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein team from silencing the people they abuse among other things some states are passing new laws that prohibit certain kinds of confidentiality agreements\nZelda Perkins was an assistant to the Hollywood mobile and she says some of the current laws protect criminals\nPerkins left Weinstein's company Miramax back in Nineteen Ninety eight after a colleague revealed that Weinstein had tried to rape her last year Perkins broke her confidentiality agreement after about Twenty years of keeping her coworkers secret here she is in an interview with the BBC\nThan than the ... the ... and ... thanks for side [noise] um but it's way too many important things changed around how things the claimants and I ... you cannot have an equal document that protect the criminal\nMany state lawmakers agree with ms Perkins this year in the wake up to meet you in time's up movement Tennessee Vermont and Washington state among others pass laws banning certain kinds of confidentiality agreements other states including Maryland and California passed laws that expands sexual harassment protections to workers like freelancers\nIt's another example of states taking action while Congress makes promises and remains deadlocked\nToday will discuss these new state laws and what impact they could have on workers and employees it's the final part of our special series this state we're in we're we've been focusing on the bills and initiatives that are trending in state capitals\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center\nThe organization administers the time's up legal Defense Fund which assists with sexual harassment cases Emily welcome back to when I thanks for having me joining us from the University of Oregon is Elizabeth tip it an associate professor at Oregon law school\nShe's also a former employment lawyer Elizabeth welcome thanks for having me and Suzanne whole team is the program director of the employee\nIt's for making time for us yes thanks for having we also have to make time for you particularly if you had experience with sexual harassment sexual abuse and felt like the law did or did not protect you if the law did not protect you in your state what went wrong or perhaps what did the laws in your state do write\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover and who don't become so when you look\nAt workplace sexual harassment laws um title seven as the federal law that says that you can't discriminate based on sex and that includes harassing people on the basis of sex\nBut title seven only covers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees so if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment law\nStudent hold seeing the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to more workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states are expanding protections and who they're covering\n[noise] yeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduced legislation and twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states I have introduced legislation other relates to limiting or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or ending force are betraying agreement so\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York times the California and he mentioned Vermont and Washington\nAnd other states are also looking addict standing training requirements [noise] um so how many hours messed a employees are employers and require training and so we've seen legislation on that path in um California is just one example of that\nElizabeth tipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws\nWe heard from an ear is already who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor she says she could not reports\nIt and I was like I don't want to pose that on my social media it can change your reputation I really wish I could to protect myself in both situations are just I feel like I Would have had a sense of agency and and when it felt in control of my life\nFor certificate how common is this for freelancers in this situation\nI Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractor and that's because employers have no incentive\nTo provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws at all\nSo even basic protections are like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaints stem the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nWere speaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law Susan whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures and Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I'd love you to react to comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am a Florida based graduate student at Boston University\nThis year BU required all students all staff and all faculty to complete a sexual assault training course\nI had no idea how many legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nEmily just use rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have passed laws expanding sexual harassment training and the education requirements for for some employers\nTrue we have seen this chair and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of our place harassment which is exciting that there's been new creative\nUm will ... thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on as\nRequired and training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there's no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected what sorts of ...\nThe long overdue attention she workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in a workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor took but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean as a certain kinds of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment\nWell when you think about me to as a sign of a broken system you want to attack all of the aspects\nOf this system so part of it might be that our laws in general do not really hold employers accountable when there is harassment in the workplace that it's relatively easy especially under federal law from place to get out of them\nAnd a lot of states have really low caps on damages though if you through your employer the maximum amount of money that you can get from them you know in some states might be fifty thousand dollars that's not much of a deterrent for employers who are trying to decide how much to invest in their system to address harassment\nObviously our series was about what state lawmakers are doing to address a number of hot button issues across the country\nAnd let's hear from one state lawmaker right now in California joining us now on the line is California state senator ... Jackson she's a Democrat representing a district that includes Santa Barbara and part of Ventura counties\nAnd outs of insurance so they can prepare for life stepson downs coverage options and more information can be found at farmers dot com\nAnd from American University's ... school of business committed to business being a force for meaningful change through graduate and to undergraduate degrees mission driven curriculum and a hands on approach Morris co God ... can ... you\nBack down to our conversation about so called me to legislation trends in New state laws the name to strengthen protections against sexual harassment\nWas Emily Martin of the national Women's Law center Suzanne whole scene of the national conference of state legislatures\nAnd University of Oregon law school assistant professor associate professor Elizabeth tip it's we woke up some more of your questions and thoughts as well especially if the laws in your state that deal with sexual harassment sexual abuse worked for you or failed you we'd love to hear your story or even just your questions about the way these laws work\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one eighty or email one day at W. A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reactions to what we heard from California state senator ... Jackson sounds like can't California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think\nI agree that California's ban a real leader in space those with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session\nAs well as if you love that unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim you know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is\nThey want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action\nSo you know we joined the national news lots and are joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week\nCalling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think it's really a beacon for other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their laws and meaningful way spending states I Believe that you're targeting in particular [noise]\nWell I think that one of the things that we've seen this past year and that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a past new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement that the condition of coming to work\nThat would ah keep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and so we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution\nSuzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and and\nI'm introduced a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that\nI did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that provides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment of workplace in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitations laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find that conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org sets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously I Wonder Susan if we can begin to the line of aware nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose in contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing ...\nHowever it is a disservice to our communities when they're used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement to them\n[noise] yes well that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just call them contracts um or other types of agreements\nMost of the legislation that we've seen us specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily band nondisclosure in great agreements and hold but just as they relate to this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nProfessor typically ... before we move on to too much for there can you just define that term force what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do\nWell there's actually two types there's the type that you mentioned that people sign at the start of their employment and says keep our information confidential and other than other types of people signed usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they've hired a lawyer and those are to settle the person's legal claims\nAnd those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct of the current or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts on her line the case\nFor someone who speak with you for a minute I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or help for hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you would have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there maybe some contradictions\nWith federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line well\nFor the contract you sign up the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes clear that does can't cover sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract\nThat keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that so the contracts in a way educate the employees about their rights\nIt's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person is represented by a lawyer and I've heard of plaintiffs lawyers say that they like these provisions 'cause it's move the path toward the settlement\nAnd aren't at the table future effect and potential victims of harassment they don't have a say and whether the victim and the employer decided to keep the information secret\nLet's get to some of your comments and questions Alex tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier\nLuckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where and when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on emailed my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for a work conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution\nDo laws across state lines especially in Illinois and New York complicate the legalities that would otherwise help bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on\nWell that's a great question if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond setter ally yes there can be complicated questions that arise if the person is usually employed and win state but the harassing\nOr assaulting behavior was in and out there\nBut it's important to remember that we're talking about state law stay in the ways in which states are going above and beyond federal protection there are core federal protection they should be strengthening various lead\nThat their core federal protections again workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment and schools and so that is a baseline that covers everybody with the important exemptions that we've talked about\nBut no matter you know what's that ... they live in\nA suit and I'd love to get your take on one of the states that did not pass at least one of its proposed bills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven eight would have stopped employers\nFrom forcing workers to settle sexual harassment disputes through arbitration state representative Raymond cruise voted against the bill among other things the rep said it would open up litigation for everything\nNow we're considered one of the most litigious states and the nation's one source I just looked up said

U. dot org or give us a call eight five five to three six one a one a apologies to those of you who are trying to call in on the line we've been getting deluged with phone calls\nSome of which we've had to screen out very quickly that we're going to do our best to put some of the most useful and positive and productive calls on the air\nTo those of you who've been making that job a little bit harder I think it might be worth sharing a comment from Alexander who emailed I have a message for those who hold this kind of hate in their hearts I don't care who you are I don't care what race you are a part of what ... do you follow who you voted foreign twenty sixteen I Will find\nYou and I will love you there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop me\nCharlie ... let's get back to Thomas comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it has given legitimacy\nAnd leads to action one of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert powers had there\nA gab dot com is a sort of a basically a Twitter clone um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racists bigots [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter\nFor for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know eat the absolute power of free speech but when it ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only the sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I ... it it has become a a place where white nationalism\nA and and extreme at bigotry homophobia whatever ... has a has been embraced and and uh and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say his name\nOr was it maybe not radicalized necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his I truly hateful views it was the last place where he\nHad posted before at the shooting\n... I'm an after after um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active a participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming and realizing this for the first time\nA note noticed that at that at this place is a dark place to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying\nOur words are not bullets in social media posts a have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this ... free speech is different from from action and I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets\nAnyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence when it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of free speech communities on line that they don't really believe necessarily for speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences than than there is sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protected so hard if it means nothing right um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people don't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nRabbi Jacobs I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like Gavin get us off the only place where this kind of speech proliferate on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment the quick first a minute lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome to folks like you\nShirt well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death in life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more truly seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to be such hate speech so it's different when we're talking\nOn whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that there are corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there is anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae B. T. Q. people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported embolden from the very top when the president of the United states that the white nationalist see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who is the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power and the United states of course trap taps into\nVery old anti Semitic tropes until we\nYeah it was a ... I'm Sorry where am I but I Do want to get a little deeper into that\nA lot of thought a lot of our listeners have been trying to get all gotten endure I'd love to to get your thoughts with that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday she began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic you will of anti Semitism and every other forms of evil and unfortunately evil comes in many forms\nAnd we come together as one American people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend\nAnger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly\nThat will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must and unquote gotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role in all of this Tuesday lives in Silver Spring Maryland right outside D.C Susan writes\nI look forward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always considers but his or her statements have far reaching consequences Indira I'd well\nThis was of course incredibly disturbing to have the president once again demonizing depressed\nAnd calling us enemies of the people\nI'm going to be under the tree and with the people I mean this is this absolutely journalists are essentially in a way the life blood of a democracy if we are not able to inform and educate\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and

I Know that sounds weird but I actually feel some hope after the massacre\nIt was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping Trump telling it like it is he could be as prejudiced and root as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nA GW tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with her own words are vote and our money\nAce in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions there needs to be consistent strong resistance to the hateful devise a speech that is anti American\nJournalists needs to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating with out strong criticism of the president's ignorant rents if not you who make America kind a gas\nHas been tough today but we've had to screen very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we will hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks so much for having the show I um\nI guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who is both religious Jewish and also very much scientific I think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have a starting with religious views\nAnd a close connection state of Israel I mean I teach at a a small school here in the city and ... in the suburbs and a lot of her students do feel uncomfortable on college campuses feel that um\nYou know if they express a\nStrong and here in state of Israel or express religious views that aren't um you know but I mean about hot button social issues but is there really to see is that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up in and how you or how the school deals with it\nBut I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know we we\nI mean there are students who are you know are not particularly\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a an friendly if if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh\nSo I mean while it's true I mean I don't think it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence from the left and that that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um\nAnd it's you know I don't know we we tell we do tell kids it probably shouldn't need need to shut up\nYou know and I don't say shut up that you know you can't argue with every class or\nJust kind of how you're going to have to learn to live with that kind of pick your battles and I think that's a hard thing\nYeah to pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised students to do that they're not\nThey're not at all everything will David I'm but can be it can be very hard to even let me\nPut that to you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs right but what do you make of David comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond to you and to Stephanie or speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I Want to say Seventy first time really tired that your son is going tree that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course at high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nVery often it expresses itself\nAs a as a tax on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is it anti Semitic which it's not you can criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses a line into anti Semitism [noise]\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of Israel's governmental policy as we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out who carry out violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually choose who are shopping in a grocery store manager store in a synagogue\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred\nA race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is that it's being supported by the government it would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore\nWho's ... who was criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who was trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. but instead we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nGet to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation which has many recalls we can't as well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our nation rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid to\nLive within our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope various religious leaders offered support strings and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything's going to change we citizen\nTown better endure would you react to that I feel like part of what worked\nI hate to say in Pittsburgh favorite but one of the things that I think helped in this whole process as you described scroll hill is it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had so when crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to lock arms with one another\nThat's right I mean a squirrel hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community um it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon university and pet and a lot of the people who live in squirrel hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentist\nIt's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall\nIs also um you know politically or liberal community\nAnd it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton and this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community of Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help and Pittsburgh's favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the and then the enemy at the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning\nI'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta just four months ago an attacker killed five reporters and Annapolis newsroom the capital get that so you know I Do think we have to worry about drawing the line\nUm I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happened\n... attack on the one in here just mentioned CNN is reporting that are suspicious package that was addressed the CNN was intercepted at a post office in Atlanta the investigation I don't think has at least yielded any public information in terms of what was in the package whether it was similar to the ones\nThat were sent last week but that story is just kind of breaking as of this morning let's get to a few more of your calls and comments including one from Pittsburgh where Lee is on the line highly what's on your mind\nOr judge will how're you doing today\nSure what's on your mind how ... how are your neighbors do and after all this\nUm time very upset you know it's it's it's devastating of a family of friends and goes to words in there and the little squirrel hill it's um", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "29"}
