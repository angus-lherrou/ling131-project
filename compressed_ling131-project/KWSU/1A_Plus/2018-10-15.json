U. dot ... before we move on from Medicaid read\nI I Do want to get your sense of kind of where this is going only one state Maine has approved Medicaid expansion through the ballot box so voters in Maine voted for expanding Medicaid but the governor of Maine Paul the page still refuses to do so\nHe talked about his opposition to expanding Medicaid during the morning talk show on W. veal AM radio back in July here's part of what ... governors said\nOr one thing I Know is no way they can force me to put the state in reading and I will not do that to tell them to go to jail before I put the ... the state and read it and if that's the core tells me I have to do it then we're going to be going to jail\nAs part of Maine Governor Paula page speaking back in July and I read ... telling voters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political feet or I mean not just going to add\nA ... page is a he was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh he was the loud and and bombastic candidates in a one two races that uh uh he probably shouldn't have one in the political sending that you know main is a pretty liberal state and\nI came into shake up the old order and that that's what voters elected in foreign\nUh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters um the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point ... pages turn out this year or the Democratic candidate is leading and in most of the surveys that ah that that up there um but it it has not happened yet and as a consequence Apollo pages actions\nThere are thousands of people in in Maine who not only voted for this thing but voted for this thing and now don't have the health care that they that they need it and this was a ... it's a problem in Maine especially in communities that have been hard hit by things like climate\nPretty devastated and they work for very low wages in pretty dangerous jobs and a ... you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs and issue I think that everybody sooner or later has to grapple with dozens of states pass laws this year the aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you\nWe spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about isn't about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am representative Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the ... paid the retail price the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that they might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would have been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned at the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers\nKennedy and for the Democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag clauses and the bill had not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that Rhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with the air with the pharmacist and and learn what their their pricing options are because\nOf that is consistently one of the big complaint so we hear from our constituents on a on a regular basis is how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing how many states have passed laws like this will\nBe these gag or clauses are are pretty common and uh\nLast year there were a over a dozen states that [noise] excuse me took up legislation or having to do with these gag clauses um and actually just recently President Trump signed a bill outlawing these um gang clauses this was kind of low hanging fruit though of a of a dry\nThat that will be less federal legislation and the state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggled to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nSince you mentioned the president's he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these gangs clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nIt's the ... the lowest price active two thousand Eighteen and patient right to know drug prices that [noise] and uh\nObviously based in the name you can tell that just gives people knowledge as to prices have different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact too [noise]\nIt's called the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have that people didn't want to have that [noise] but now we have it and it's going to really drive prices\nScott back up to the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law on this a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest of these laws in the country what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with this kind of progressive legislation is and is in the lead on this on California is trying to reduce drug prices for transparency in other words they are\nAre requiring um ah the drug companies to be public about a price increases increases beyond a certain point and the idea\nIs that uh if these are made public that they'll sort of be shamed into into reverse in some of these increases it's still too early to say though whether this is going to have the desired effect um nevertheless other states this year California passed its bill\nOr in two thousand Seventeen and last year you had five more states um Connecticut Maine New Hampshire Oregon and Vermont all passed a drug pricing laws that are similar to California so we'll see whether transparency is enough to reduce prices and then in addition to that\nUm some states have tried to go even even further than that Massachusetts passed a bill that would've allowed a its Medicaid program to exclude some drugs from the a formula to the um [noise]\nUh the group of drugs that are available to Medicaid recipients and the idea was that this would give them some leverage when negotiating with a drug companies over prices if they were able to exclude some FDA approved drugs and and as of right now Medicaid state Medicaid\n... that would give them leverage negotiating on prices but uh the federal government shutdown that that effort by Massachusetts\nI Want to make or understand the argument from Massachusetts what they were trying to do anything for the federal government shut that down so Massachusetts does not do this now run out for an hour an hour now but the ... it sounds like you're seeing the argument is you know find Massachusetts\nAnd you know Julius the drug company I could say hey Julie this medication that we know is FDA approved is still too expensive and we're not going to just pay blanket leave for a medication we think it's too expensive so you have to keep negotiating or we're not going to we're not going to honor that part of the\nExactly that's right I mean interestingly enough in this uh uh the federal government do it rejected a mass of the Massachusetts effort\nA President Trump has proposed um that there'd be a pilot program where five states would be able to um\nTo do this what Massachusetts wants to do an addition to change the way that a Medicaid works with regard to drug prices and allow these five pilots states to negotiate directly with drug makers rather than um adhering to this national price formula so there is interest even though\nA this Massachusetts effort was shut down for now there is interest in in this idea of one of the criticisms or one of the concerns is that patients who\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and

through our app won a vox pop our series the state we're in continues next Monday on one day\nBack now to our conversation with read Wilson Julie Rovner and Scott Greenberg are still time to get in a few more of your questions and thoughts about state health care policy where you live\nTweeted isn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support is that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer plan has a high deductible\nWell of course the people who have an employer plans with a high deductible or big problem in the lower income people of those have a particular\nLarge problem if you have many thousands of dollars in deductibles have to pay before your insurance kicks and\nThere are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to ah basically fill in with employer insurance but generally medicate is sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off the way the Affordable CARE Act was created was those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get\n'em medicate the people's between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts they don't have those big deductibles so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin and we're constantly shifting back and forth between medicate and private plant and basically what they would do is the state with a lot to basically buy them into the private plan so they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere to eat sidebar for just a second let me to the point of the series it's the talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter every human being in the United states of America should have equally good planned what simple set of health care costs and there are other Americans who believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and the needs to be for ...\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is this the federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going Julie\nActually it's where it's going it's back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all these sort of small incremental changes\nThat the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act was intended to create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states\nStill do an enormous amount of regulation of how can they always have the federal government has always been sort of the the junior partner to the state um but it had gotten so such a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you lived in what kind of healthcare you were able to get\nThe way and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the Affordable CARE Act passed Scott do you get the sense that this means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding than it is taking us back to where we were before and as\nWell as Julie sedatives in some states but in states that want to go in a different direction again to California Massachusetts states like that they are re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example\nAh on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they're doing the federal level um insurance is regulated at the state level and if you're going to sell insurance and our state you are going to abide by these rules\nI'll tell you one issue read that states and many people have been hoping the federal government will act on and it's the it's kind of moved on anyway and that's dealing with medical marijuana it's on the ballot in some states again this year about twenty two states have already legalized pot for medical use some of legalize the recreational use\nVoters in Utah will choose whether to join the states or not and the political battleground seems to have shifted and I want to read if you see it this way for more traditionally liberal states into more conservative areas overtime\nOr yeah and it's not just the medical of that has gone that way but also legalization of recreational marijuana the two states where a legalization is going to be on about this here as in Michigan in North Dakota\nMedical you know for ... for recreational noted for in in on the medical side there are three different amendments in Missouri which is nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which are and then that Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved it this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana ah we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with this debate or it came up and you know in Florida last year and\nLast last year two years ago but this is this is now a debate that I think it shows the shift in the political conversation around marijuana those sorts of people who approve of a marijuana legalization tend to be a older white males funny enough\nAnd then the millennial generation that the younger the basically the younger you are the more you in favor of a legalization you happen to be um the older white males the theory is that's the that's the sort of lists\nVoters are perhaps not surprisingly come down to suburban women are in talking to the people who run campaigns for and against marijuana legalization or basically the battleground is mothers who are worried that their kids are going to be exposed to marijuana\nSo you get the proponents are talking about the law enforcement or ability and ended the fact that it's not that this will not expand the market into younger people who will have to have access to recreational marijuana and then you've got the opponents who say exactly the opposite that legalization will in fact\nUh begin to rope and a bunch of kids why are there three items in Missouri\nSo they're all on the ballot from different ah proponents different sides of it with two of them are from a actual citizen groups that they put them on about those are amendment to an amendment three\nAnd then there's a proposition which I'd if critics from around I think the proposition goes on the ballot from the state legislatures that's going to be some kind of compromise or a piece that's proposition see 'em and they are all sort of competing\nWith each other and this underscores another piece of\nThe evolution of of marijuana politics pots of big business or in a lot of these states that have legalized Colorado Washington Oregon a California Nevada Alaska or Massachusetts and Maine uh the people who are setting up\nA ... who get to write these laws also essentially get to determine who's in the market um and who owns a very lucrative space one of the biggest opponents\nOf recreational legalization in a bunch of early states where the people who ran for medical marijuana shops because they already have the monopoly right why dilute the monopoly with other people\nI should know by the way we did a program this year about state laws on marijuana and the business of politics can find that on line at the one a dot org Scott\nCouple of things to add to what to read said on this very interesting issue um at one is that it's sort of intersects with what we talked about earlier the opioid crisis because there are many people\nAre supporters of medical marijuana who argue that this was a viable alternative to uh to opioids for people who have chronic pain\nAnd then also I think we've written about this um it's interesting that social justice provisions are finding their way into\nMarijuana bills or this idea that are a minority communities have been the most impacted by the war on drugs and therefore uh as we move towards legalization it makes sense to include in these bills provisions that uh\nThat ... on the one hand would allow people to ah to expunged they're criminal records for small amounts of marijuana\nAlso as a Reid said it's a big business or a step up for for people who were members these communities so they can get into this very lucrative business\nGee a Ninety One point three Clark's in Lewiston\n\nOn Castro has plenty to say about today's politics and we're America might be

in San Antonio a and the subtitle waking up from my American Dream is really about each generation of my family\nI'm kind of confronting and figuring out that to make the American dream real not only do you have to work hard as an individual is the ... and a family but really that you had to do something broader than that that you had to try and push\nYour community and the country to get better so my grandmother's case you know she came into a Texas where she would still see signs in store fronts that said ah no negroes no dogs or Mexicans allowed\nUm my mother a you know it was the first in

came to fair housing during my tenure at hard you know for years decades um [noise]\nHad different democratic administrations had been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty eight fair housing act um that said the secretary of HUD had the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing\nThe problem was that that had never been put into a rule on so in twenty Fifteen we actually came out with this rule which put teeth into the fair housing act by requiring cities that got\nA hug money basically taxpayer money to get more serious about ensuring they had equal housing opportunity in their community\nAnd I'm very proud of it ah unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back um through a secretary Carson and the Trump Administration a second thing that we did that I was just fantastic for the folks who are able to benefit from it was something called connect home\nUm the vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home and we know that you're having Internet access and home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity\nFolks

is Huck doing on this now\nWell I Wish I could say I have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that is not dedicated to the mission that wants to blame people for being poor you know that secretary banker yeah which I completely disagree with I think they've taken in the wrong direction\nI'm the best thing that can be done is is number one to invest the resources\nTo create more housing that is affordable to the middle class and of course to low income individuals uh and\nAnd then also the ... work with the private sector in important ways for instance at the local level to figure out a zoning codes and planning codes to make affordable housing more develop a bull\nYou spent some time in Iowa you were in Des Moines last week supporting Democrats there who are running for office and we know\nThat President Trump's trade policies toward China are really hitting some farmers in Iowa pretty hard last month I was agriculture secretary Mike nags spoke to CNBC about what impact that that's having at home\nWhile it as we head into the twenty eighth taint harvest season for corn and soybean out here in Iowa this escalation of the trade conflict really couldn't come at a worse time so it is impacting our markets and that's impacting our farmers are farmers to understand that there are issues that need to be resolved particularly with China\nBut there is no doubt that the retaliatory tariffs are impacting our marketplace and that's impacting our producers negatively\nMets Mike negative secretary of agriculture in Iowa speaking to CNBC\nI Wonder if you've been hearing what you've been hearing rather from farmers and pork producers and others in agriculture is you're making trips through Iowa and and elsewhere are are some of them okay what's the current state of

wondering what's the plan here\nUh you know I think a lot of folks are can believe that we can improve our trade relationship with China\nBut they think the president has gone about it are completely the wrong way in this go it alone style very radically starting a trade war that is going to hurt Iowa farmers they're also disappointed in their representatives are folks like Steve King right now

agreements between Mexico and Canada what about the trade deal that the president has been making in his time thus far particularly if to become president and twenty twenty and have to enter office

of these trade deals and the thing is that uh what's missing from the Trump Administration is any kind of\nA of fought for plan on these things in fact even with this latest a rebirth of NAFTA it seemed like they were rushing right through the finish line and just cobbled together whatever they could get at the end or it none of these things seem to have a plan behind\nA significant part of
