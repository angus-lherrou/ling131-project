you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it but I loved it for the entertainment value but my big pieces that moment\nWhen he brought her onstage and knowing that was not her comfort zone knowing what she'd been told that she wasn't going to be good enough that no one would care that no one there to find her interesting or attractive\nAnd she just went out and she killed it and they loved it in for that has second ac that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her that was a pretty important moment if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself out\nThere for the same reasons is kind of a big moment\nYeah I I I hear you on that just does that resonate for you in a way like was there something personal that that made you flash back to work out for a lay\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know\nI Do a lot of things where I have to go out in front of crowd or in front of people and you often hear you know you need to be dinner or project lower or beat this or that are younger and at that moment with kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that moment\nThat we can personalize it whether it's in an interview or what have you and I think that was in Port Charlotte\nHeather what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her nose\nYes [noise] yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she's like this is my name is all me to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got them to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and then I thought it it kind of the ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's an alley billboard and he says we should have just made the old billboard you're knows\nI mean I think the thing about the comments about our noses and also a guy guys honoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] and one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist in and thrive\nShe adds the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think the weirdest thing is placed in time where this movie is a place in time it's interesting to think about that\nBecause almost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's really no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming and playlists and um the major record they both having less\nPower than they used to so it's almost like old fashioned and its view of the music industry but only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also chime in but by the way for those who have not seen stars born will not be seeing stars form of just kind of want to be on the conversation she tells Bradley Cooper is character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are good you're saying well but your nose your nose just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go when the homes I Wonder how you view the commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie I felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona\nThat she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink who's very much and invention of pop music but you also have this kind of rye cynical style style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this found in order to be aligned with a view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways\nIt very linear it's a very linear idea of they're the one I'm rose to fame there is one pass you just simply a stand or deep sand as opposed to there is no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score and movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWith out kind of going through that traditional path agreements and about that but I think that um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them passed each other on this same ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about\nEric Garner talking about well I have said I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist like Lady Gaga who has been so able to make such an indelible\nMark on the industry and on popular culture I mean the funny thing about this movie as she is way more important to culture than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from Bradley Cooper they've had a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd in that way\nYeah except for that voice in rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean she is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley spend a lot of time sitting up that first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga is character alley is just improvising a love song\nTown than [noise]\nA kid can do that\nTo [noise]\n\nTo me [noise]\nBradley Cooper Lady Gaga in a star is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano and saying and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we sang together I mean everything's alive we said we sing everything live in the movie [laughter] wow yeah there's nothing we're not just lives thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga Hussein next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in a scene in the actors fully believing that you're the character you cannot believe it yourself so she really gave me the\nBradley Cooper speaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration\nThis is my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meets jak here they stumbling blackout drunk\nAnd I think it looks as if he just spent a weekend at a bar do Kevin Cavanaugh KCUR\nAnd I don't find that interesting or attractive if she had met him sober and he fell into alcoholism and stayed with him it would be more interesting he's he's increasingly mean he has petty\nAnd I think as his alcoholism ... becomes words he continues to treat her worst and yes he's Bradley Cooper and yes he's is incredibly talented musician but I never really bought fully what alleys saw in him\nTwo beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is I'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them\nFrom the beginning um but then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forced element that it doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed it\nBecause when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction to operate in a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough\nTo drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's\nWhere I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was\nBy agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell\nThere was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on stage to rehearse with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way for me\nIt exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of the the narrative issue with the ending\nWas oh go ahead and go ahead\nWell of course of course the the ways in which\nA Hollywood and the fame machine or the same monster as Lady Gaga once called it and one of her album destroyed people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of stars born in ... and in fact all the bridges of the SARS going to have a manager character in a different embodiment um that character in this film I absolutely agree was\nVersion he almost with a sympathetic enabler um of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know we're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name a valley ... and the stars porn versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of being part of the cast you know has to be there [noise]\nUm I also just want to say before we end got to get this out there that um this is also the story of how\nA woman's rise leads to a man's fall [laughter]\nAnd that's an internal problem with the stars bar and you know\nUm it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nA ... toward the lead female character but there is this underlying sense after saying\nThat even as Jackson, Maine is saved temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from his young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushing the periphery\nYemenis raining problematic found\nWell but you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a feeling male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era\nWe get to a few more if your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars\nI deeply appreciative ... nuanced shyness in her early portrayal which made main characters advising her work well I'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance\nHis scenes seemed a little too detached from me overall I Love the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from Largo in ... North Carolina who tweeted three stars a star is born was a story the performances especially the musical ones were fantastic and the cinematography was incredible\nI expect a lot of nominations to come for deep ie the director of photography cinematographer\nMatthew ... production designer Karen Murphy costumer Aaron been attacked\nAbout shooting live performances which are not really straightforward spaces to navigate here is a part of that conversation from Cape PC sees the frame\nIt this film was very difficult to sort of navigate the stage performances because we had three different modes basically [noise] we had the Coachella mode which is I'm borrowing stages or that were already set up with the lady that was already existing\nAnd putting in our own crowds and then there was the I'm running guns sort of we have ten minutes to shoot him between two sets with a real audience\nApologizing in thanking the audience for I'm sort of I'm shooting a movie in between\nTwo bands and then we had the third which is the Greek theater which in which shallow was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie fashion who was able to create the Greek theater as a set\nAnd put a certain amount of crowded and so that was my most controlled um scenario\nBut the lighting of it had to have a consistency like my goal was that um you know in creating a character from sort of cinematography standpoint Jackson, Maine might as well be um [noise] oh I don't know Jack White and I had to make sure that the um\nThe audience maybe subconsciously felt that this is his lady you know\nThis is his road show and it's also in the film in the sort of visual movement of it all representation of rock and roll\nThat was Mathew seek the cinematographer on a star is born speaking to John horn on Cape he sees the frame\nJohn can you talk a little bit more about the making of this film particularly back to Kathleen question who wrote on Facebook how you can tell if a film is well directed this kind of a film the way that Matthew described it presents all kinds of additional challenges to make it a well directed film shooting in so many different kinds of locations\nYeah I think the ultimate question about what is it is not a well directed film it's do you believe that do you believe you're watching Bradley Cooper or do you believe you're watching Jackson made if you think you're watching the actor you're not in a well directed movie if you are with the character\nYou're in a well directed moving there are certain different ways to achieve that and I think Bradley Cooper does the chief that and I think one of the things that he achieved really well is an immaculate but he talked about this this seeing this performance of shallow so you have to direct that seen as concert footage it has to be compelling as an audience to watch these two people play music\nClark's in Lewiston\nClimate change we made this mess and now we have to clean it up and time is running out a new report gives reasons for concern\nFrom WAMC you and NPR in Washington DC is one and [noise]\nYou there I'm Joshua Johnson today on one a controlling climate change\nThe report is clear at this pace or a warming planet we'll show major signs of irreversible damage by the year twenty four seats we know what to do but that's not the problem the problem is getting the world government to do it how do we overcome the political challenges of fighting climate change and how much do individual actions\nLike planting trees or going to be you can\nReally make a difference and saving the planet\nWe love to hear from you email one day at W.

S. um what we see is President Trump not only you know essentially questioning that the basic established of of\nClimate change but but also moving to undo existing climate policies I'm President Trump has already moved forward with policies to undo regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants um undo or weekend\nUm regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from cars um and he had said that it is his objective to promote the use of coal I'm burning coal is one of the leading contributors to greenhouse gas emissions\nA President Trump wants to promote the use of calling us and abroad um one of the findings of this report is that in order to um limit greenhouse limit climate change to\nUm you know to to to the sort of least destructive um level of warming um the use of coal will have to ah basically go down to zero\nI'm by by twenty fifty so we have basically no more on just about no more coal and and and and it is you know that that it that is an extremely disruptive policy recommendation um there's no question that there are industries and people who will be harmed\nWho who will have their livelihoods disrupted by policies um that go in that direction only that\nMe just once I started to shore call but I Wonder in terms of the politics behind this that I hear you on our I totally hear you on how disruptive decisions on what coal is so interwoven in the network of America's energy grits kind of hard to just yank it all out\nI Wonder do in terms of the voices on the world stage who we we know that there are voices who were saying well poll it'd be really hard to pull out\nTo get the sense that there's any one of the world stage saying\nWithout a phone ya California so Jerry Brown the governor of California for sure\nYeah and many of the ... on on the president of France has sought to kind of a step in and um\nHe he's trying to carve out a place for himself as as a as a leader on climate change it's it's not difficult for France to take that position because France um doesn't really use call\n'em so but but but we I mean we absolutely see world leaders saying you know this is what what needs to happen um\n[noise] in China it's very interesting because um China is the world's largest um greenhouse gas polluter and is NASA user of coal at the same time we're opposite that the Chinese government had moved forward with I'm actually in acting\nUm prices on carbon ah they're they're they're an acting a cap and trade system that would force um carbon polluters called polluters to essentially pay a tax or the\nUm I did in in order to pollute which is designed to drive the market\nAway from from greenhouse gas has an idea that was invented in the United states but it's I'm considered sort of politically toxic here in China they can implement it by ... they don't have to deal with that Congress voting against at Iraq and in the United states\nAre doing it or you want to talk more about that idea of carbon taxes and we continue in just a moment but let me get to a few more comments uh Brian emailed we have no leaders anymore with the skills or courage to do what's right regardless of the political cost we\nWill keep polluting as long as the price of fossil fuels is low would be interested to hear from some of you listening who you trust to using some of the leaders are politically in this country around the world who\nYou believe are sincere in their pushed to do something significant about climate change is there anybody that you think is for real and saying that we're going to make this happen or maybe if you were active with a politician or a government leader or a government agency it's doing something tangible\nThat you feel people should know more about we'd love to hear from you what gives you hope that climate change is something that is actively being worked on where you are email us one a at W. A. M. U. dot org by the way we've been talking in terms of degree Celsius yes I Know where we are\nIf you need a little conversion one point five degrees Celsius we mentioned one and a half degrees and two degrees for those of you don't have a conversion calculator in your head one and a half degrees Celsius is about two and a half to point seven degrees Fahrenheit and two degrees Celsius\nWendy quote unquote global warming scare first appeared long ago it was made a political position by the Democratic party that immediately convinced me that the manmade weather change is nothing but a political hoax to fool the stupid professor live from and what would you say to tell them\nWell I grew up in a country Britain where it's not political and to set aside part of my life I Lived in a country where politicians and the public um costed scientists and ah\nAccepted that clip of warming is happening so when I moved to the U.S I guess it was I'm a little surprising to find how pumped and the basic scientific problem is um and\nWe have to find some way to get other than that I think that's one of the things they are to the report tried to do we tried to tell people what to do we tried to put together all of a scientific information so that policymakers can make the decision I did want to add to it turns out that regions that are doing that part\nSupport for NPR comes from the station

alliance for a lifetime income data work\nBack now to our conversation with Coral Davenport of the New York times and University of Arizona professor Diana Lieberman we got a number of messages from you in terms of how you are trying to make an impact with the fight against climate change here is a little mash up of two of the messages we got this is Amy from Chesapeake and Jeff in Michigan listen\nI'm getting a thought to get ... thought slash feeling of powerlessness and that I Can't stay with enough to stop that the path of destruction that we're on\nOur pessimism comes because I Believe that what's happening to the world is happening at a corporate level and I'm Still more companies get on board and care about the environment\nThat feels like we're kind of on the inevitable path and two thousand forty will be here before we know what we will rip the consequences\nThanks Geoff an Emmy for sharing your thoughts with us ah speaking of the corporate path there are some corporations who are taking a position in the fight against climate change including with regards to the carbon tax Melissa tweeted\nChina uses more than twice as much coal as the U.S hard to believe some carbon tax is going to make much of a difference considering their population let's talk more about carbon taxes with one more of our guests joining us from London\nTed holstead is the chairman and CEO of the climate leadership council Ted welcome to want to a\n[noise] good to be with you ... what is the climate leadership council it is a group a that is co founded by a by actually the broad as climate coalition\nThey did to the American people in the form of ... of ... of a dividend\nWho were some of the back of the council where does the funding come from so um the council is a does not accept corporate contributions but our founding members include four of the ah oil major is the largest car manufacturer in the United states the largest utility but also the largest\nA solar company in the United states\nA very broad coalition it also includes two leading environmental groups and opinion leaders from across the political spectrum ranging from\nBen Bernanke key to Janet Yellen to Larry Summers and of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker and George Schultz the Bakersfield carbon defense plan but Joshua let me clarify we have there is a separate spin off organization that has a lobbying organization\nAnd that now has corporate funding including from Exxon okay and that is connected to the organization or use it as they spin off but it's there's still a connection in any way or completely separate uh it is a separate organization that is the advocacy\nArm of the climate leadership council so the council develops this groundbreaking breaking plan were all sides wind\nAnd Americans for carbon dividends which was co chaired by\nFormer Republican Senate majority leader Trent Lott and a a center bro that group lobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power interests\nCoral Davenport let's take a step back before we get into the planet the climate leadership council is advocating more specifically defined this term carbon tax for what exactly is a carbon tax shores so um\nThe idea of a carbon tax in them and each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere um you can put a price on how much economic harm it causes\n'em and add in ... and I ... in important no on that at the the economist who came up with with that idea his name is William North house he's a professor at Yale I'm was just awarded the Nobel Prize for this idea on Monday\nOr the same day that the IPC came out with this report which heavily sites I'm professor not half as work um so he came up with the idea of every kind of carbon um trap heat in the atmosphere and you can put a price on how much each kind of carbon her\nI'm fifty dollars a ton to a hundred dollars a time when I'm you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost that once you sort of place that price on carbon um than you are can essentially um create attacks I'm at a price on carbon or attacks on carbon that you would impose upon polluters have carbon dioxide no no\nNo more carbon source or or cruel it's going to be really clear in terms of who the taxes paid on I mean if I Am a car maker do I pay\nThe pollution from automobiles does the carmaker pay carbon tax for producing the vehicle that belching out carbon dioxide or does the oil company pay the carbon tax for finding the gas alone that's likely\nMost likely you pay at a as a car driver I'm okay\nAnd and and and you you would so um we don't have carbon taxes in the U. S.\nUm so in some ways this this is sort of um you know in intellectual debate although other countries are are working are sort of further along on this but the idea is\nUm if this would affect how you drive it would probably um be taxed based on how much carbon monoxide would be produced by burning 'em by burning gasoline show it would most likely be added to the cost of the gasoline that you put in your car so if you're going to put in\nAnd in Mount of gasoline in your car that would produce a certain\nAmount of carbon dioxide when you burn it that would raise that tax would raise the price of gasoline and the idea is then you would be motivated to buy a car that use less gasoline essentially that that's how it would drive the market so consumers would want to buy electric cars would want to buy efficient cars\nNot because not out of some sort of\nA moral sensibility but because actually a ... a price on carbon would make it cheaper to use an electric car it's a it's a powerful market signal\nTo hosted the yesterday Exxon Mobil committed money to lobbying Congress for price on carbon give us a sense of what the plan involves and why it's getting support now\n[noise] so um the bigger shields carbon difference plan is based on four pillars of the first is a robust carbon tax starting at forty dollars per ton which would actually be the highest carbon tax of any\nA leading emitting country all of the money will go directly back to the American people in the form of a carbon dividend which means that the ...\nThe plan and a third pillar is that we would trade a high price on carbon in a growing price on carbon for some of the carbon regulations simply because a carbon tax is a more cost effective way to solve climate change\nThe law just wanna make sure I understand so the plan if the plan went into effect there would be a tax on the carbon that I Am it with my car or my motorcycle or whatever and then that the revenues from that tax would come back to me as a taxpayer in the form of a of a dividend is that what you called\nYes so a family of four would get approximately two thousand dollars per year in dividends and here's how the system would work\nThe more you pollute the more you pay the less you pollute the more you win so Seventy percent of American families would come out economically ahead and that's what's so transformative about the dividend concept which is that we can have\nThe most effective climate lever which is a carbon tax in a manner that is popular populist and equitable for the American people\nHow much of that money would be spent on environmental programs are planting forests or doing research on cleaner energy with all of it just come back to us as taxpayers\nA hundred percent would go back to the American people and that is what makes the plan a popular\nAnd politically viable because in ... on Capitol Hill you'll never get the two sides to agree on how to spend the revenue Republicans will say well let's spend on deficit reduction are lowering the corporate income tax Democrats will say well let's spend it on a renewable energy innovation or a low income support\nIt opens up Pandora's box by contrast when you returned all the money directly to the American people it closes that box and what polling shows is that it's overwhelmingly popular most interesting\nThere's three to one support among Republican voters and Trump supporters for this plan for the one support among millennials which of course or soon to be the largest voting cohort\nHear you in terms of the political viability I think it's interesting that your organization is put together something that can actually pass at least in your view could actually pass and seems to show support on on both sides I Wonder if you believe that it would actually for lack of a better word works", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "10"}
