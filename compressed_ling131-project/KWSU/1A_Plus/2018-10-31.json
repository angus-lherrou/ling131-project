I Wonder if you could could help me with this ah the use of the word which I don't know if you've encountered this but I've encountered a lot of men who have used the W. word\nBecause they knew they weren't allowed to use the B word this word is very charged for a lot of men I mean even that song by Frank Sinatra witchcraft where he says there's just no nicer which than you I think that's kind of a sideways reference to that the word is that something we have to grapple with\nAbsolutely and we see it in politics all the time you can Google pretty much any female politician and no matter what side of the aisle they're on you will find them photoshopped as a witch\nOn it so that really is still a negative epithet that a lot of people use to put women in their place to shame and then on to shut them up especially women who are in the public eye who have opinions as you dare to speak their mind\nYeah I I Wonder kind of cost us where we do\nWith that mixed connotation a Nobel wrote on our Facebook page\nI don't see the concept of which is a positive feminist forcing mainstream American society if a woman says she identifies as a witch in any sense of the word she's only embrace without identification and taken culture the word which still has negative connotations like witch hunt\nSo I don't see it as a way for feminists to assert themselves and be heard as strong powerful voices in society\nAnd Kathleen wrote on our Facebook page here's what I learned as a young girl from the wizard of Oz well behaved sweet witches are always beautiful graceful and kind which is to strive for power are ugly mean and bitter not exactly a feminist message Constance\n[noise] yeah I mean I think that the listeners aren't rounded the either the message is there I mean one of the lines in the wizard of Oz rate is\nA door and he said which is our old and ugly and ... says no on the tablets are older than I could eat good to get it for their general there's definitely a kind of classic Madonna who I could come in that moment dichotomy here where we main issue\nOr it's here to the status quo like the heroine at the cops said as I get to the powerful to a certain extent as long as they used their power in a way that is I really that falls in line with the way the men in power and want them to do it on and when an issue\nKeep listening for more and more than a [noise]\nFrom

film that launched his career\nHalloween John Carpenter directed and scored the original back in Nineteen Seventy eight and he's the composer on the twenty eight teams sequel which is in theaters now John Carpenter welcome to want to thank you for having me you've been away from a Halloween movie franchise for some time now what made you decide to come back\nOn his producer Hollywood producer Jason bum a convinced me to come back\nI knew that one was a sequel was going to be made as I Know a Malik the cod he's the son of the man who put up the money for the original Halloween so I knew there was this equal coming\nBut Jason's bomb a talk to me and he said you know where it's going to be made\nGet aboard and try to help it would be good so nobody had put it to me that way before so I thought that's a great great thing\nJason Blum spend doing some pretty interesting things with horror movies lately what what do you make of where the genre stance today\nThat's in good shape but it's always in good shape horror has been was cinemas since the very beginning and I have a feeling\nA will be with us until doomsday just because everybody's scared of something that were all born afraid we all understand fear and so it's really fun to go to a horror movie with your girlfriend or your significant other and cuddle and scream and so forth\nFor what was it like for you not being in the directors chair for the twenty eighth team version of Halloween you were involved in the film but what about watching someone else direct this movie it was a relief\nBecause I don't have to suffer the stress and anxiety that directors suffer and that's a worst profession in the world other than being a coal miner\nThe worst other than a cold I'll come on\nNow well it could be worse I guess you could be a slaughterhouse type measures that you're right it's not the worst now\nUh when when things were a it's great to be a director when they don't work it's it's really garbage\nWhat do you think movie fans least understand about what it takes to direct a movie especially a horror movie for ever or\nDid they at least understand let me think a a directors are responsible for all of the central elements of a movie if it's supposed to be funny they're responsible for the humor of it if it's an adventure and so forth and so on\nSo director of a horror movie think of it this way horror and comedy or a lot like 'cause it's timing it's all about timing is all about when things happen and how they unfold and it's more complex than than people assume but [noise]\nUm people just thinks that horror as a lot of war and obvious violence and it's not\n[noise] yeah see I I I hear you on that it's an interesting analogy between horror and comedy I'm not big on door I Do not personally do well around blood and Gore at all but a good suspenseful movie\nLike I can I can hang with that 'cause that's that's a satisfying experience what what do you think it takes to make that kind of timing in a horror movie work\nWhat is it what does it take to make a horror movie work\nThese are secrets that only the Brotherhood now so I Can't oh come on you can tell me something well look\nThe horror horror movies come out of the story and horror\nIs every action think of it that way not a genre necessarily so it's a reaction to things and that is the story is is unfolding than you used the storytelling\nTo a a a set up your scares set up things frightening for the audience he said the word earlier suspense that's what you if you get the audience in suspense and you can scare them\nTo maybe the key is having a story\nIt's got enough of the right elements to make me feel that's spent so that they're there can be that pay off so that there can be the scare is that it\nThat is correct you got it what about the music you contributed music to this film and and the music to the original in Nineteen Seventy eight what does it take to make that kind of music work for a scary movie\nWhat does it take it takes a certain amount of talent and ability to play a musical instruments and a feeling for him\nThat's what it takes now were you always musically inclined when you put the original movie Halloween together Nineteen Nineteen Seventy eight or wasn't something that kind of came together unexpectedly\nNow as I grew up in a musical household my father was a music professor he was a [noise]\nA virtuoso violin player and he had taught to college level music courses at the university where I grew up I grew up with music in the house all the time classical music listening to it\nHe decided when I was about eight years old that I should learn to play the violin there was only one problem with that and I had no talent other than that it was a great idea\nBut I moved on from the violent to the piano and tar and other things I picked her stuff up\nWere there any particular influences that you draw on when you made the music for the original Halloween or that you drawn on over the years\nYes I'm all classical a\nMovie composers and classical musicians and rock and roll I'd get influenced everywhere\nWhat about the timing I did the theme to the original Halloween is not in a plain old for for your time it's in five four time it's an odd kind of time's signature was what drew you to that\nMy father taught me five four time uh when I was Thirteen he'd try it on I had a pair of bongos I got to Christmas so he taught me five forum and I thought it was unusual just straightforwardly unusual timing side\nUnder the director of dozens of heart classics including probably some of your favorites Halloween to think Christine prints of darkness escape from New York\nAlso a musician and composer who wrote the soundtracks for many of his films including the sequel to Halloween

rhetoric particular link during the years that Obama with an office as an African American he very much a set off white supremacist who were unhappy with him being elected to the highest office\nAnd the Internet it self has allowed this kind of material to proliferate radicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't the case in prior areas so we have a lot more of it around and that's certainly something Trump has tapped into\nNick how do you see it\nUh there's no question that there is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something's going on internationally when you look at Europe ah there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of a post World war two consensus um you know in general throughout through the the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he isn't happening it and he's exploiting it to his political uh aims\nWe need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse and this is not um I'm not even talking about the rhetoric of hate per se um of polarization of opposition at this point according to Gallup about twenty six percent of people\nClose as those noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other major institutions\nWe need to come up with a a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is\nI'm not a you know that is not based on demonization polarization and again either Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not\nSimply a politician he is also on some level I he should be leading the discussion in a way that us more productive than he is but he's also not the only one are you doing this um\nAnd um the other thing to think about though is what is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and get them when we we live in a find a a society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera\nBut in general crimes are going down and violence is going down so again\nRecognizing that rhetoric is one thing in reality is another I think is you know as the starting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need to reset and that it needs to be a it needs to move away from polarization but this is much much bigger than Donald Trump I Wonder though Nick\nHow much power we give the words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not saying that words have zero power but ... who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence those weapons for sure and they let you all are\nUh you know yeah I I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realized that it I I you know or maybe it's a slippery position where I'm saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters but also that we need you know what what are we going to do about that so I guess as it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous it as hate filled it is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's been now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how do how do we have a better conversation about politics or places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then it knocked policies that actually work for the benefit of of people I Do want to talk\nA little bit more going forward a little later in the conversation about what next steps might look like next to ... we will circle back to that Jennifer ... a number of people\nHave commented on the role of the press of various media outlets that I Will try hard not to use the term as media because there are so many different kinds of media out there will try to be a specific as we can ... and ...\nThat is extremely helpful to keep it up let me get to a few of your comments about various media outlets in various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs to be twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news the president much like Andrew Jackson stands up to the press should he just let the Ninety percent negative coverage go we all need to be personally responsible\nMod asks why does he get so much airtime\nAnd Jim Wright's why hasn't anyone address the years of conditioning the public has received from talking heads such as Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck Alex Jones et cetera\nBut have permeated our society and uh finally elected veer leader which only embolden some Jennifer before you react to that sweet of comments I should note that going back in recent years\nHas tried to walk back some of his rhetoric and has as publicly apologized in his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder Jennifer what your senses of how much of an oval various media outlets plan this\nIt's a great question and I think that um there's a little bit of a historical big picture that um maybe would inform my answer here I'm In part of that is the reciprocal role that used to exist between the president and the press\nUm it used to be the case that uh there was a mutually beneficial relationship between the presidency and the press a largely because they needed each other at a press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out\nAnd that relationship has fractured a and that's largely due to um cable news and social media and the fact that we all now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nOn and so information circulates in a very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago um which is really fractured this relationship between the press and the president and Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but Trump has really done much better for worse job depending on your perspective um and so a Trump is completely mastered the news cycle and the way that ah\nIt especially cable news has been complicit I think in in amplifying his message or you know on Twitter he has followers\nWe see hits tweets everywhere right and because those messages are amplified and that is Trump using the bully pulpit to good pope that of the presidency and also taking advantage of all of these other social media opportunities and\nAnd and so in this case a lot of times the press is then guilty as impulse sinus messages and then they shouldn't ask\nHow do you buy Rick I Wonder how much you put the blame on various media outlets versus the president I feel like at this point we're kind of used to the drum beat of opinionated commentators on television and radio it's almost a trope in our culture I mean\nThe new Spiderman game on the police station has J Jonah dream is and the guy used to be the publisher of the daily bugle where Peter Parker worked as an AM talk show host whose whole job is to criticize Spiderman and it comes up in the story line like we're so used to this\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from logged me in makers of go to meeting a collaboration

our conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program about voter access head of the midterms we've heard a lot of concerns about people who should be able to vote not being able to voter fraud has been a hot topic for the last few years some say voter suppression is worse now than it's been in some time\nHow easy or hard is it to vote where you live what have you encountered in terms of registering to vote or casting your ballot\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a if you've ever run into problems voting what was the issue and how did you deal with it\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one day or send us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Jennifer ... Heidi by Rick and Nick Gillespie a few more of your comments Fernando tweeted we are all adults at adults take responsibility for their own actions the media is trying to find a scapegoat and it is truly unfair but then again he is blamed for everything\nDone writes the shooter is responsible dumb question\nDrew tweeted Trump may not be responsible for the violence but the people who are feeling Bolden and encouraged by what he says as long as he remains inconsistent in denouncing violence and hatred they'll continue seeing him as an ally\n... from what she can you respond to that last week from drew it is true that the president\nWhat's real was to denounce white supremacy bigotry hatred melts forms in that press conference that impromptu press conference with the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday I think you said there were good people on both sides I Wonder\nHow you view this in terms of the the way that the president denounces why what's at least at a statement and then makes comments that are vitriolic thereafter how do you see\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address the question of responsibility and if we have a moment Jim that after answer\nI'm so Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he was forced to do that\nBut that isn't his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial in these situations when people do try to hold him accountable and suggest that he has some responsibility for something\nSo for example during the campaign I'm a group of white nationalist at the Daily Stormer decided that they would avenge\nUm what they thought was a bad a article that was written by Julian ...\nUm and so they sent her um hate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nOn and when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and\nYou know the sun CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it and then he denies association with the people right or he says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mine you know are these are these fans who've done this\nUm and then he does a third thing which is to wonder what um the journalist or lay off he had done to deserve this hatred you know did she write this terrible article that is full of you know lies about me um\nAnd then to accuse ... other people doing the same kinds of things right to an appeal to hypocrisy um and if you look at when Trump is responding to these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nAnd he follows that same pattern he denies knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to quote ... which is an appeal to ... to say oh everybody else does this it's not just me\nUm and that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable [noise] this is why I call him\nUm and and we're talking about whether Trump is responsible and we can say that he's responsible but I'm telling you Trump does not accept responsibility he won't take that responsibility I'm an admitted that he in fact has been wrong\nI Wonder how effective do Jennifer it is in a situation like this to refer blaming you for this kind of wondering what your take is on it to refer to President Trump\nAs a demagogue I mean she is the duly elected president of the United states of America she won the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue you call all the people who are elected him supporters enablers of a demagogue at a time when something like this happens\nBut it's got to make it harder to have the kind of debate we need to have about ... about refining the civil discourse\nSure it's an accurate term so um if you look it up in the Oxford English dictionary and the lady you'll see that the first definition of a demagogue is positive for neutral it says that it's a leader of the people which is that the etymology of the word\nWho defends the rights of the people against the other parts of the state the second definition of demagogue is a leader who uses polarizing propaganda for their own personal gain\nDonald Trump is a demagogue in both senses of the word for his fans for his followers and his voters the ones who won't leave him who\nWill defend him at all costs they just send him because they see him as a heroic demagogue they see him as defending their rights against the other parts of the state that they believe are corrupt\nEveryone else who sees him as a demagogue into bad sense of the word sees him as using polarizing propaganda for his own gain\nFor the use of the word to use a word accurate though it may be is it helpful\nI think so [laughter] it's an analytic point we can't understand what Donald Trump is doing if we can't understand what he's doing an unaccountable leader is a danger in any political community but it's\nActually in a democracy political scientist and historians who are concerned about the health as American democracy people who are charting democratic erosion and how democracies die they point to the kind of language that he uses they point to the authoritarian tendencies\nOf I'm wanting to uh\nYou know jail people or change the constitution\nUm as as ended in a democratic erosion\nHeidi a wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think are a number of people on the political right have raised which is this idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around that the political discourse\nAs just heated up in both directions many on the right has pointed to the left saying that they use similar rhetoric to the rhetoric that President Trump has been using but they don't get cold out for quite as much here is a sample of some of what they're referring to\nNeeded time for Democrats to be as tough as they are\nTo be dedicated to arm to be committed to say on\nThe show always says you don't when they go low [noise]\nBagel low reaching [noise]\nDaddy cabinet\nThank\nThat you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the Senate that twin ... can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican seemed to recognize and respect strength\nThat of course was former secretary of state and democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton preceded by democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters and first was former attorney general Eric Holder Heidi what about the ... across the political spectrum how does that factor into into our current climate\nWell there's no question that there was ... as well on the left but I think it's a little ridiculous to try to say sort of like Donald Trump did after Charlottesville but there's some sort of equivalent here the real nastiness is coming from the right and it's coming on the basis of attacks on immigrant\nMuslims global is which many people would argue are anti Semitic theories and and there's something else more dumb violent it's coming from the right we don't have domestic terrorism it's out of control from leftist that needs to be the case in the Nineteen sixties but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Pullman", "day":
