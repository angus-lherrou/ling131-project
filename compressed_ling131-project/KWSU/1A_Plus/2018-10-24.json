A. M. U. dot org before we bring in our next two guests Steve I didn't want to ask you one thing about the way the documentary was made I Wonder how you said about\nTelling the students' stories I mean there is a moment in one episode where either you or a cameraman tries to talk about one student about her cutting class I mean all the kids that you follow it goes through various struggles with\nHis class was grades with life what kinds of boundaries do you have to set when you're telling a story about high schoolers\nWell that's a great question um I've always tried in the films I've done over the years has to be a ... had the subject feel like they have real agency in the making of what we're doing\nA you know the idea we aim for is is that we're really making the film with them not on them and yes ultimately we have editorial control but we take very seriously that kind of relationship and on this series it was vitally important\nThat they are also be other filmmakers involved we had a diverse team of filmmakers Kevin shower Rebecca parish being Lou\nCharles who started was followed by Kevin Shaw I mean I found a little bit with Charles but that's really Kevin who I mean being I'm Sorry being that that followed a Charles a story and they had to establish these kinds of relationships that important now the moment you're talking about is with tiara that's actually a story I happen to be falling and you know\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with her because she was struggling with a lot of things at that time I thought was relevant to include that in the film\nA few more of your comments before we bring our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we fail to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period end up sentence\nAgility for fun to read it I watch every episode of America to me I absolutely love it\nI'm shocked at how clueless and the white teachers are especially that physics teacher the school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by doing either civil disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Stephen ... for his thoughts on the series we did not get a response but that invitation remains open\nWe also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school Nathan rouse\nWe were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary eat or is that right to the vets right\nWas that the more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmanda Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy\nAt the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called despite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to say thanks for having me also with us here at W. B. easy as David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is a Chicago native professor still Volkow thanks so much that professors have you watched the series any part of it some of it all there yes\nFestival what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest\nThing that struck me the hardest as an episode to win one of the parents of a student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the empty conversation that we do not have about schools\nThat have the illusion of integration and I think an illusion of integration because it just means that students of color are in the same place with white students\nWhen ... mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties\nProfessor Lewis what are you [noise] you know one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in this area is but I think one of the things that all the struck me as the silences some of the some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate in it wasn't\nOne of the things you notice in that district is that the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families are the key leaders and the district a lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like\nA opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a sample of what's actually going on in the district\nPay by the way for those were you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you were eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so do that in mind in the conversation if you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them tweets do not tweet may\nRuin this film for you I don't want to hear it but if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety at the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a\nDot org we're talking about racial\nEquity professor so vote what does that mean what does racial equity\nLook like is it making sure\nThat black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people feel being nice to one another like how would we know racial equity if we had it\nRight I mean I think this is and thank you for that question I think that saying around equity and I think the ... to him and his point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution\nSo when you talk about redistribution so now the question becomes who has had the least and now what are those things that they talk about that they meet the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they need it and I think is ... is the issue of concern\nGive me an example of getting people what they need when they need\nA young person says we have a particular problem with this teacher who is constantly giving us disciplinary referrals constantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious\nNow there needs to be so that racial equity team at the schoolhouse whoever that is that person needs to be in the conversation that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people most often happens in school houses that young people are blessed\nThere's two advancing toward racial equity is it is it funding is it the people involved is a different for every school in every district what tends to get in the way [noise]\nWell I'm going to talk about the park at the world and there are a lot of them and I think one of the things that um my colleague John Diamond and I found when we were doing the research for our book was that when you really try to understand why changes so hard it really is\nEspecially in these kind of community\nAbout the folks who have a lot of resources that have been served well by those districts for a long time not wanting change to happen and we talk about that is that kind of form of opportunity hoarding but it's a way of trying to decide how rates work today differently than it worked in the past in the past\nWe might have said you can't be in my class or we're going to have separate schools all this kind of things today we had the veneer\n\nSupport for NPR comes

tomorrow poison it appears to be Russia's preferred weapon of choice and we'll find out who Moscow was targeting and why we like to know what questions you want answered so leave us a voice mail\nEight five five to three six one a one a America's relationship with Russia and what what the Soviet Union has had its fair share of ups and downs but what message do you think Washington should be sending to Moscow now\nEight five five to three six one a one a I'd say five five to three six one two one two will dig deeper into the files of Sergei ... Paul and get to some of your questions tomorrow from Atlanta on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors amend the Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one day taxes go up how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother text club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up it took me years to rent myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as by African American friends\nSchool to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like advanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way can push too far\nThat we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic\nPerformance what do you make it\nTo me I I mean it's not in a a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough\nRight when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied\nOpportunity and then how\nAre those opportunities denied in real time currently and because\nOne wife student did not get one scholarship does not mean that black and Latino students across the country do not hard not to make Lee denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural\nAnd I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve I got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to parse out three actions that that finally\nWell I've I've not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdote experience isn't that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience if for no other reason than there are other reasons is that we've tried to\nTake you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not living in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of and documentary filmmaking including some past work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white\nParents Charles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for anyone high school but yours but in terms of [noise]\nJust just because of the color of their skin it does that reflect your experience and off my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general like there's kind of like a ... there's this blanket we put over white kid that's like your you know they always going to be one\nRegardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color they're like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of sleeping bags\nFull ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who is also a feature documentary where like I wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to compare than the other students but the school has like\nI guess prominent interest in that because of what we do without extra curricula\nAnd so it was just already saying that they're like okay well we need to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who isn't in any extra curricular who doesn't have any type of um non student teacher relationship with any adult in the building\nThey like it's hard to get you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there the blankets by the sleeping bags whereas like all other white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and\nHave a stake in the school the parents are big funded their siblings went there whatever whatever and then you got the kids who I mean like meat luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to oh the but other than that right it was nothing\nReally to kind of have to fend for yourself\nExactly ... that's just not the case you know I think it it goes to showing 'em which episodes that we must have done it was like\nMost of the kids and he is honored um tutoring sessions are usually white fair and now why do so yeah All right and that's that's part like you know personal accountability but that's also to school like you got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to get on his tutoring but that's just the one right that you know so well\nTo that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years [noise]\nYou know it's hard to look at the high school level\nMath like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens of these kinds of districts\nThat tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts do we take kids that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in\nAnd we track them early and what we know over and over again from research is that that tracking means that kids are in higher tax get more they get better and better teaching and so we take his it might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time and so\nWhen we look at school like a park and they've said earlier\nThe structures that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks\nUm are inevitably going to uh take racial disparities that exist in our society and and reproduce them in our schools and the the ... the troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how these trucks get created and if you look at the history of the really deep\nRacing history of tracking and general race else becomes the explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational basis in school or Ninety percent white\nAnd the least advantaged educational experience you know there are places in the same exact school are predominantly black\nShould have us all up in arms about the fact that we think that that's okay it's all about our racial mythology\nI I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and bought a good education is them you know I've heard a PE teachers including ... Williams the black or it'd be future and the berries\nLament the fact that as a piece students often just want to be given the information they need to score well on the test that's what they want they're not really that interested in learning but just the it's a game it's in supporting\nGame I mean in terms of a larger kind of a a a an editor for vacation like having a more well read learned some of the some of the most interesting and I think for far reaching a deep teaching was going on at lower levels which is not to excuse the system the romance was talking about\nBut we just because we define being educated in such narrow ways it's about eighty two scores and GPA's\nAnd that you know and that's what we defined as being an educated person well I I hear you on that Steve but at the same time you know I think about I'm not trying to excuse for ... I I hear that I fear that though I ... I Wonder though professor still while I think about\nYou know kids who grow up in in rough for parts of town that have been told your ticket out as your education and to get your education\nNinety One point three clocks in the Midwest and\nThe murder of journalist ...

now for a brief update is Shane Harris intelligence and national security correspondent from the Washington Post sheen welcome to want to say Hi Joshua we also welcome your questions and thoughts about the ongoing search for the truth in the death of Mr ... or what all of this means for the relationship between the U.S and south\nYou'd dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one hey Shane one more audio clip we should play before we dive in further and that's from secretary of state Mike Pompeo he spoke to reporters at the state department yesterday and he was part of what he said\nWe're making very clear that the United states does not tolerate this kind of ruthless action to silence Mr ... a journalist through violence we continue to maintain a strong partnership with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia neither the president nor I Am happy with this situation [noise]\nOur shared strategic interests with Saudi Arabia remain would continue to view as achievable the twin imperatives of protecting America and holding accountable those responsible for the killing of Mr ...\nSo that secretary of state Mike Pompeo speaking yesterday he says and neither she nor the president is happy what actions are they saying the U.S my ...\nWell we're still waiting to see right now we've heard secretary Pompeo say they're going to be some visa restrictions on individuals suspects who have been identified as taking part in this operation which um I think most people see admittedly is a fairly weak measure that's not necessarily punitive to the regime\nOf Saudi Arabia but he did say that there could be economic sanctions coming and it's actually something is happening right now there is a process that's been triggered\nUnder a law called the Magnitsky Act which traditionally has been used to sanction Russian individuals who've been involved in crimes including crimes against journalists the president has a period of time now where he can consider whether to issue sanctions against individuals Saudis\nSo that could be coming but the key part for me and the remarks that pump AMA yesterday and you played it was that there's this twin imperative of holding people responsible but maintaining the relationship that second part but I think it's going to be driving to policy had and guiding whatever decisions the administration decides that it wants to make with regards to the Saudi Government\nDo we get the sense that that balance is starting to shift you're right there are these kind of two needs early on the president talked to a great deal about this one hundred ten billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia now the administration is talking more about some punitive measures is that balance starting to shift I think the balance\n\nSupport for NPR

or Saudi Saudi American what does this conflict and America's role in it mean to you\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one at a or email one a ass W. W. dot org Barbara emailed I still talk weekly by phone to your many friends in Sana'a and sought a V. are living in hell and they ask\nWhy does America hate us so much why does America wants to kill us\nWhat do I say\nSomeone before we continue in before we bring in our next forces on the conversation I Wonder if you could just haven't been following the Yemeni civil war very clearly can you just boil down at the core of it what does this conflict about who are the fighters and what are they fighting for\nSo Yemen's conflict is actually quite complex conflict a it's a it's a conflict that has many layers to it but ultimately what you hear in the news is that's a it's a Saudi Iranian proxy war you also hear that has he got at the ... the government in Sana'a that announced itself is actually in fact\nA coup government that has drawn by militia and that the Saudi Government is trying to restore the legitimate Yemeni government ah to power in Yemen now the problem with all of that as this conflict is\nFailing to do all of the things that they're saying it's a it's about for example\nWhen Saudi Arabia got involved in the conflict with the Arab coalition the aim is to bring back the Yemeni government the Yemeni government has been residing in jail since the war started and uh is struggling to go back to places where there is no so see I'm bullish on the ground\nAnd on top of that the who the militia in a sense has gained so much more since the war started in the sense that at first they had to share power with uh the former president of Yemen where you know in two thousand eleven you haven't had a revolution and I'm the president was removed\nBut he ... himself with her knees and was president for some time but I'm the sheer power with him now fast forward three years into the war they had killed them and and now they have their own control of the majority of the north of Yemen\nAnd of course the the scariest thing about this is the ... had managed to capture the Yemeni military arsenal that belong to the former government is now all in their hand\nAnd so in a sense what the war dead is complicate an already\n[noise] uh for example Seventy five percent of the Yemeni population is is suffering and in need of immediate aid and depend on foreign aid to kind of survive and this is a Seventy percent increase since before the war began um\nAnd I didn't want to talk more about the the population on the ground but needs help I just want to both before we were next wars and also just want to be clear there was a sectarian part of this abuse\nWho the rebels who kind of came after the government you're Saudi Arabia involving itself but there is a Muslim sectarian aspect to this also is Sunni versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of people don't realize first of all the Shiite and Yemen are don't practice the same sect of ... that Iran practices or\nThe Shiites in Lebanon are at all to practice they practice a sect called the DSM and the ideas and is known as five or ... and it's really different from twelve or shall which is a the ... he formed that's practice in Iran\nWhat's interesting is that it's the closest form of Shiites them that resembles so many of them are and Indiana and we the Sunnis there are ... and the divide isn't you know the the ... are not a minority like in other places they're forty five percent of the population\nAnd so what's interesting about this you know Sunni Shia conflict is that it's entirely manufactured in a sense that of course there are differences between these those two sacks of course there are situations where they don't agree but they managed to co exist for many years\nNow that said these are the who the sect of of you know what's happening in Yemen they're no longer practicing as they did them as it is it seems like they're trying to politicize stay DSM into kind of a associate themselves more with the Iranian sect of Shias and Sunnis in Yemen chastise them\nHas struggled to maintain its effect as it is with the influence of well how does them and set up as him coming into the country and so in a sense what you're seeing is that the most radical elements of those two\nAre fighting each other and so in a sense you have the presence of a new ... conflict but one thing that I have to point out to the listeners here is that that's not the only thing going on\nI'm a huge portion of the country in the liberated territory from the control is actually demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south and ever since Nineteen Ninety four the people\nAs this conflict continues\nI Do want to make sure we get to a voice on the ground in Yemen but I hear what you're saying some on terms of all of these very complex fault lines but it's kind of come together to fuel the civil war today now before we came on the air today\nWe were able to get through to Sana'a in Yemen all communication into and out of Yemen is really tough but we did make contact with leaves ... she's the UN's resident and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen least laid out what the conditions are like right now for those who\nAre living and working bear here as part of our conversation that we take just a few minutes ago we've gone to welcome to want to thank you very much can you give me a sense just in a in a larger context how many people the un fears are at risk of famine right now\nIn game and we are worried that his steps are not taken right now\nIn order to stop the spread of hunger that we could see as many as fourteen million ... who are facing famine by the end of the year\nThis is why the United nations is ringing the alarm bells and telling everyone that we are facing possibly the biggest famine in living memory if we don't do something to stop it right now\nWhat are some of the other health risks that you're looking at their other than just starvation I'm sure with deprivation of a reasonable secure supply of food all kinds of other health problems also come into play right\nThat's exactly right last year\nThe largest cholera outbreak in modern history hit and then there were more than a million people who are suffering either from Colorado or from watery diarrhea there had never been an outbreak of such magnitude in living memory\nNow this year because of the work work\nThat's being done by frontline partners and UN agencies and officials here in the game and we've been able to contain the spread of how the Democrats have similar levels there is a lot of color in the country but it's not spreading at the rate of course last year that being said when people exist\nFor months and months on supplemental rations when they are eating\nLimited amounts of food what happens over a period of time is that they slowly start and this is absolutely what we're saying for millions of people in this country\nTheir immune systems are weakening and that makes some highly vulnerable to infections and water borne diseases including color\nWhere we are right now doing this program from Chicago is Thirteen million people just by way of contacts least give me a sense of what\nA mother a father a parent has to do in Yemen right now to try and feed their child to can you boil down to what an individual might be dealing with just to try to feed themselves and feed their family would they have to do\nSo sixty percent of all of the people who live in this country are what we call food insecure now out of that out of those Eighteen million people\nEvery single morning there were eight and a half million who wake up and they have absolutely no idea where they are going to get food from\nThat day [noise] so what will happen is a family will use absolutely every means at their disposal to secure of what they can they'll go to their relatives and bake\nThey'll go to religious institutions and bake and they'll come knocking on doors a non governmental organizations in the UN and ask for our help\nThey'll go to rubbish bin and pick out what they can they will walk through the streets from the beginning of dawn until midnight looking for any scrap of food it is absolutely desperate\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Subaru featuring the all new three row with tent with feeding for up to eight and a choice

Hamdani still time to get some of your questions and thoughts about the conflict in Yemen and about the U.S Saudi relationship\nContact through Facebook our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org before we continue some al Hamdani let me come back to you for a second I checked in with our audience here at W. B. Z in Chicago to kind of asked them if\nIs the nature of this sectarian aspect like several of us and we have a memory of of age range of your students than seniors and everybody in between have heard of Sunni and Shia Muslims\nBut then that like the the sects within the sect\nI think that's where a lot of it's kind of get lost can you can you bottom line that for us what difference does it make what effect these people are with like why why does the sects why does it affect involve matter to this didn't you just kind of simplified force\nAbsolutely so when it comes to Yemen like I mentioned um the majority of the northern part of Yemen is historically say D and the majority of the southern portions of Yemen as historically shaft eye and said these can be called Shia and the chef ... they're called ...\nNow the ... conflict a kind of began years ago and then was revived recently\nUm what we see as the political importation\nOf religious sects of what we're seeing it play is political Islam and that's what you're hearing about you know the chefs in a conflict it's not really a religious matter today it's really a political matter of allegiance to what part of the middle east are you going to support and what we're seeing play out is that\nIran is announcing itself as the um [noise]\nKind of the guardian of ... and Saudi Arabia on the other hand is presenting itself to the world is the guardian a finance them and so as soon as she our is pretty much kind of people fighting for the interests of who's going to take control in the region\nAnd that's what this what's happening in Yemen you know for instance when this war started\nWe know that the u._s. then under the administration of President Obama had struck a deal of um a nuclear deal with Iran and the sense they sacrificed Yemen by saying here you can fight Iran in Yemen but the U.S is going to kind of find this deal with Iran\nNow that was a short sighted move because I think a lot of people then didn't anticipate that today President Trump would come to power and then today you have an a nuclear deal with Iran a and at the same time also had this devastating crisis in Yemen and so in a sense\nSo let me let me was I think so let me let me back up and try and repeat back to you what you just said I said I've been drawn a diagram everybody here it'd be watching\nAnd she Islam is this old centuries old fight that has been made political you use the phrase political Islam to describe\nHow we run as kind of for political and regional power reasons trying to kind of claim itself as the the defender of the Shia Muslim face and Saudi Arabia has kind of\n... anointed itself the defender of the Sunni Muslim faith and that politicized Islam has spread into other conflicts and Yemen these factions in Yemen\nIran and Saudi Arabia are supporting these factions is kind of a battle in this larger war for the soul of political Islam is that kind of it\nSure yeah exactly and so what I'm saying is that historically and traditionally the sect of Islam that Cantonese have practiced for years are not necessarily aligned with the Saudi an Iranian sex but for political reasons they are now aligning with each other gotcha\nGotcha folks here it'd be easy does that make more sense good we got some up all around if you go and I I appreciate you explain that I think\nYou know part of the complication Jane Ferguson is that this is complicated I mean some wars you can't just\nBoil down to one cause but that also makes it hard for\nUs sworn in Yemen to zero in on them and and really think our teeth and but your reporting has involved some of the people on the ground who are dealing with the results\nOf this larger fight for the soul of political Islam you describe the story of an eleven year old girl that you encountered back in June the kind of stuck with you can you give us the basics of what happened to her\n... telling her story is one of the race for the most important reason why journalists need access to this because we have to put a face and a name and a picture to the statistics otherwise they're just the tip steaks and I think that we we deal with with a lot\nOf that of of of difficulty trying to get the public to understand the level of this crisis so I ... I was in hijab\nAnd which is a problem and sort of in northwest of of Santa and controlled by the Houthi rebels and that and it's meant and that's in the town of hijacking the capital of the pilots there was a hospital where like every single hospital that I've seen ... the children's ward is now\nA de facto malnutrition word and we were just filming there with some\nWith a tiny what looked like just sort of like a bundle of clothes and it was hit eleven year old sister name was ... and for a horrible few moments we really thought may mono might die in front of us on the hospital bed she was eleven years old and\nWay too I think twenty four pounds was what that it was about what we had to what we had asked that the doctors at that and it was absolutely a horrifying to watch her she you know when when a child gets so weak and so\nAmong nourished they also become so vulnerable to any kinds of infection and so they tend to get a diarrhea anyway and so even even if you do manage to get through to the ... and uh they get diarrhea they get devastatingly dehydrated as a result the whole thing just spirals until the child's body just gives in um\nWe spent some time they're filming with my own end speaking with her family and her mother eventually came the next day we were able to talk to her and we were piecing together the family's story and it is a story that reflects millions of\nPeople's stories in Yemen and it is that her father was a schoolteacher and a government school but whenever the uh the government salaries stopped over two years ago\nHe his salary stop to wants people lost that level of income the government was that the the biggest employer by far in the country before the war and that's not just soldiers and police that's people who work in offices that's teachers any kind of clerical work or any kind of bureaucratic work in Yemen\nWants those salaries stopped people would then go on to trying to live off of what the aid agencies would call coping mechanisms to you and I that simply do have any savings do I have a line of credit at the local store do have any livestock in the backyard do I have relatives who can help us out after two years\nThose coping strategies run out and they ran an ad for this family and they simply had no money and wanted child starts to go downhill it can spiral out of control like this\nThey were lucky family because they were able to afford to pay a cab to take them to the town and ... and lots of families are not that lucky and so one of the things that is really important to remember by this crisis is we don't even know how many children are dying for ...\nOr we don't know how many don't make it to the hospitals and ... and you know this one child came from a middle class family and educated father and that's really terrifying benchmark of how deep and dangerous this problem is wrong", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "24"}
